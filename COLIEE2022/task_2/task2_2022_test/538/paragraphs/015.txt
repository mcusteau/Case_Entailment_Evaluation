It is trite law that a decision-maker may believe some, all, or none of what a witness says: see, R. v R.E.M., 2008 SCC 51 [R.E.M.] at para 65; more generally, R. v W. (D.), [1991] 1 SCR 742 [W. (D.)].  I readily acknowledge that both R.E.M. and W.(D.) are criminal law matters. However, this basic premise of decision-making does not, in my view, conflict with the instructions from the Court in Hilo v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 130 NR 236, [1991] FCJ No 228 (FCA) that negative credibility findings must be made in clear and unmistakeable terms.  I find it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that generally Mr. Zheng testified in a straightforward manner but that his more specific claims regarding his practice of Falun Gong and his alleged pursuit by the PSB lacked credibility. As is evident in the analysis below, the reasons for the negative credibility findings with respect to those two issues were clearly articulated by the RPD.
