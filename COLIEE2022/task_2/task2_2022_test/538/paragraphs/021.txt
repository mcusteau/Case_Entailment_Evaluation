With respect to the lack of a PSB summons and the RPD’s finding in that regard, I find the following observations of this Court in Lan Cao v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1398 at paragraph 35, to be directly on point:
While the documentary evidence suggests that the PSB’s practice with respect to leaving a summons is not uniform, it does not directly contradict the Board’s finding. Indeed, given the number of times the PSB was purported to have come knocking at the Applicant’s door, and at that of her mother, it was reasonably open to the Board to conclude that a summons would have been left. The mere fact that it was possible for the Board to conclude the opposite does not, in and of itself, render the board’s decision on this point unreasonable.
