The RPDâ€™s conclusions regarding a lack of credibility with respect to the issue of pursuit by the PBS cannot be divorced from its finding of a lack of credibility with respect to the practice of Falun Gong. While a finding of lack of credibility with respect to one aspect of the evidence does not necessarily lead to a similar finding with respect to other aspects of the evidence, the issue remains one for the RPD and not for the courts. I harken back to the principle that a decision-maker may believe some, none or all of what a witness says.
