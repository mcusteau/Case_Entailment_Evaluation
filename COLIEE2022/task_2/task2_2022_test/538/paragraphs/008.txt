On the issue of whether Mr. Zheng is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, the RPD recognized, at the outset, Mr. Zheng’s limited education. Regardless, the RPD was not satisfied he is a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong. The RPD reached this conclusion given the  following inconsistencies between his testimony and the practice of Falun Gong as set out in the National Documentation Package [NDP]:
Mr. Zheng explained that the Law Wheel is found throughout his body. However, it is in fact located in one’s lower abdomen. Once the RPD pointed this out, Mr. Zheng conceded it is located in his lower abdomen but that the effects are felt throughout the body.
On the issue of “karma”, Mr. Zheng asserted that “the more we practice the more we get”. Actually, the opposite is true. The RPD noted that the concept of Falun Gong is to eliminate “karma” by cultivation. In Falun Gong, Karma is not a thing to be acquired. It is something to be eliminated from the body.
Mr. Zheng had no apparent understanding of the concept of cultivation.
Finally, the RPD concluded that while Mr. Zheng may have participated in Falun Gong exercises, such as Chi Gopng/Qigong, there was no evidence such exercises are a “banned practice in China”. Also, Mr. Zheng’s assertion that he only practises these exercises when he has time, and rarely in a group, contributed to the RPD’s conclusion that he is not a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong.
