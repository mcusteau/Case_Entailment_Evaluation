Mr. Zheng contends the RPD made implausible credibility findings based upon its erroneous interpretation of country condition documents. Specifically, he says the RPD erred when it suggested that the PSB’s failure to leave a summons was inconsistent with PSB procedures. Mr. Zheng points to a lack of country condition evidence in that regard. He also criticizes the RPD for making implausible assumptions about the PSB’s potential treatment of Mr. Zheng’s spouse and son, if it (the PSB) were truly pursuing him.
