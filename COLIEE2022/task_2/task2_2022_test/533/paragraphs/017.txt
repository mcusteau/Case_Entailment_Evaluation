That same manual provides in ss. 10.46 and 10.47 for Extensions of Permits and for the Expiry of Permits, and these provisions include in part the following:
"10.46
. . . . .
2) Before any extension of a Minister's permit is issued, all available information will be obtained from the office which originally authorized the initial permit and any subsequent extensions.
3) In cases where a permit has expired and the persons concerned are now seeking extensions with permission to take employment, the CIC will issue an extension, providing the original conditions still exist, and require the person concerned to apply for an employment authorization.
. . . . .
"10.47
3) A letter requiring the person concerned to leave Canada by a specified date and indicating the possible consequences of noncompliance should be sent to all persons whose permits have expired and against whom removal action is planned. The letter need not specifically extend an opportunity to make representations; however, if representations are received, they should be considered and a reply made."
