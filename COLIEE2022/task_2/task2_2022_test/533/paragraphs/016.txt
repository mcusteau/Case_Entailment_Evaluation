The principle of fairness is reflected in the
Immigration Manual
of the respondent's Department, which in s. 10.53, concerning Cancellation and Removal Procedures (of Minister's Permits) provides, in part, in paragraphs 1) a) and b)
"1)
Notifying Permit Holders
a) Where removal of a permit holder is contemplated, a letter indicating that it is the Commission's intention to cancel the permit and stating the reasons for this decision shall be issued in all cases. The letter should be either hand delivered to the person and his counsel, if applicable, or delivered in such a manner that will afford the CIC acknowledgement of ser-vice. In keeping with the 'fairness principle', the letter must also advise the person concerned that he may make written representations or discuss the decision in person with an official of the Commission should he wish to do so. It is not our intention that this become a formal hearing.
b) If no representations are received or if, after having received such representations, it is decided to maintain the original decision, a letter informing the person that the permit has been cancelled will be issued. ..."
