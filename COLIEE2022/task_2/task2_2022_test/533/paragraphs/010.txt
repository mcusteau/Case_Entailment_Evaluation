The applicant avers, in part so far as here relevant, as follows:
"3. The respondent by letter dated August 10, 1992, attached as exhibit 'A' to this my affidavit wrote to inform me that they have received information indicating I and my wife are no longer living together.
"4. I and my wife have at all times lived together since our marriage, and since my wife has sponsored me. At no time have we lived apart.
"5. The letter I received dated August 10 stated my Minister's Permit will not be extended and that I must depart Canada by August 28, 1992.
"6. I at no time received a prior letter indicating that it was the intention of the respondent to cancel or not to extend my Permit and giving me an opportunity to make written representations or to discuss the decision in person with an official of the Commission. The only letter I received on the subject is the letter of August 10, 1992.
"7. I do not know what the information is that the respondent claims to have received indicating that I and my wife are or were no longer living together.
"8. I had an interview with Theresa Jaworski, an Immigration Officer at the Canada Immigration Centre in Winnipeg in July 1992 in which she informed me that she did not believe I and my wife were living together. She did not tell me what was the basis of that belief. She did not believe the information given to her by me that we were living together."
