Two other submissions in support of the applicant's position should be noted. In relation to the application for leave the written submissions of the applicant which became part of the applicant's record in the application for judicial review, it is urged that the assessment of the marriage by the immigration officer did not meet the requirements established by jurisprudence, but this argument was not advanced at the hearing, properly so, in my view, in light of the evidence before me. Finally, it was urged that in light of the principle of legitimate expectations, and the principle of fairness, the applicant had a right to rely on a process like that set out in relation to cancellation of a Minister's permit, with written advice of objections or reservations of the department and an opportunity to respond to those before a decision effectively ending his right to remain in Canada. I am not persuaded, in the circumstances of this case as I assess them, that the principle of legitimate expectations is applicable in this case, nor that the principle of fairness was here violated in the process leading to the decision not to extend the Minister's permit.
