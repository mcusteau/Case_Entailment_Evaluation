[34]
At the conclusion of argument but before adjournment of the hearing, I provided opportunity for counsel for the parties to state, for consideration of the court, any serious question of general importance that was considered to be raised by this case. I did so in light of s. 83(1) of the
Immigration Act
(as amended by S.C. 1992, c. 49, s. 73, effective February 1, 1993). That section provides:
"83(1) A judgment of the Federal Court - Trial Division on an application for judicial review with respect to any decision or order made, or any matter arising, under this Act or the Rules or Regulations thereunder may be appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal only if the Federal Court - Trial Division has at the time of rendering judgment certified that a serious question of general importance is involved and has stated that question."
Under
Federal Court Immigration Rules, 1993
, rule 18 provides, so far as it is relevant,
"18(1) A judge shall not render judgment in respect of an application for judicial review without first giving the parties an opportunity to make a request that the judge certify that a serious question of general importance as contemplated by section 83 of the Act is involved.
"18(2) A party who requests that the judge certify that a serious question of general importance is involved shall specify the precise question."
