[22]
In his examination upon oath on March 17, 1993, the applicant was questioned on his own affidavit and about the above exchange, recorded by notes of Ms. Ja-worski. Reaffirming paragraph 4 of his affi-davit, he said it was true that he and his wife had at all times lived together since their marriage and since his wife sponsored him and at no time had they lived apart. The essence of his responses about the notes of Ms. Jaworski from the meeting on July 22 is that he remembered the questions being ask-ed but he denied some of the answers she wrote, that she kept him from seeing her written notes at the time and did not show them to him or review them with him for confirmation. He denied giving the answer noted in response to the question "where do you live?" saying that his answer was that "I live on 423 Anderson but I hang around 631 Langside most of the time". He further said he knew the full name of the roommate who had joined his wife (and implicitly himself) and did not think he would have said he did not know her name. He said he did not re-spond as reported by Ms. Jaworski to his question why he was not living with his wife, but he acknowledged that he had re-ferred to objections by the landlord to three adults at the Anderson Street address. He acknowledged also that he had indicated his wife would continue to live at that address until he was able to locate new premises in Brandon where he had arranged to go to college and where he planned to go within a few days to find a place to settle his family.
