When this matter was called for hearing on the scheduled date, March 17, at the request of the applicant, without opposition by the respondent and indeed with the latter's support insofar as it assisted examination of the applicant on his affidavit, arrangements were made to adjourn the hearing to the following day, when it resumed and was concluded. The adjournment made it possible for a copy of the immigration officer's record, earlier filed in the court, to be provided to counsel for the applicant and for counsel for the respondent to examine the applicant on his affidavit. A transcript of that examination was available and admitted as evidence on March 18, the final item of evidence before the court. For the record, I note that counsel for the respondent had sought to examine the applicant and his wife on their affidavits by the earlier date fixed by order of the court in granting leave, but apparently at the time counsel for the applicant had no current addresses or means of contacting the applicant or his wife, a somewhat peculiar circumstance in my view, and one that warranted adjournment to permit examination of the applicant on March 17 when he was present at the court, with arrangements for the matter to be heard on the following day.
