There is no dispute that the Minister's representatives had a duty to act fairly to the applicant in considering his application for extension or renewal of the Minister's permit. That duty was acknowledged by Mr. Justice Spence of the Supreme Court of Canada in relation to a decision to cancel a Minister's permit in
Minister of Manpower and Immigration v. Hardayal
(1977), 15 N.R. 396; 75 D.L.R.(3d) 465, at 471 D.L.R., albeit the acknowledgement was dicta in a decision that depended on the application of s. 28, as it then was, of the
Federal Court Act
. It was further acknowledged by the Court of Appeal in
Re Mauger v. Minister of Employment & Immigration
(1980), 36 N.R. 391; 119 D.L.R.(3d) 54 (F.C.A.), per Urie, J.A., at 64-67 D.L.R. in relation to a decision cancelling a Minister's permit and by Mr. Justice Cullen in
Kaur v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration
) (1987), 5 Imm.L.R.(2d) 148 (F.C.T.D.) in relation to a decision denying application for permanent resident status following a marriage interview of the applicant and his spouse. In
Mauger
the majority of the Court of Appeal found that the duty to act fairly was met in circumstances where the applicant knew the main factors, if not all allegations, upon which reliance was placed in concluding that a marriage was not bona fide and withdrawal of sponsorship by the wife warranted cancellation of a Minister's permit. The applicant, in the view of the majority, "was given sufficient opportunity to meet the case made on behalf of the Minister or his properly authorized officer forming the basis of the decision to cancel his Minister's permit, to meet the requirements of procedural fairness".
