[28]
On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that this court need not be concerned with the credibility of evidence or which version is the more credible, that of the immigration officer or that of the applicant, Mr. Kagai, concerning what transpired at the meetings on July 22 and July 31. It was urged that there was simply a misunderstanding between the parties about the continuing arrangements of the marriage of the applicant and his spouse. It was also urged that the summary report of the officer on July 31, made in advance of the meeting with the applicant, clearly indicated that from the time when the original permit was granted in August 1991, she had believed the marriage was not genuine and had considered the statements of the applicant made a year later in light of that belief. It was urged that in light of these factors the appropriate action for this court was to quash the decision not to extend the permit and refer the matter back for reconsideration in light of all of the evidence.
