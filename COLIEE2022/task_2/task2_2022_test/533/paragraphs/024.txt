[24]
On July 31, as Ms. Jaworski avers in paragraphs 5 and 6 of her affidavit, she completed a report on the applicant's circumstances including a recommendation not to extend the Minister's permit. That recommendation was approved by the Manager of the Canada Immigration Centre and, later that day, when she met with the applicant, Ms. Jaworski verbally communicated the decision to Mr. Kagai. She further avers that he was then advised his application for permanent residence from within Canada would not be processed as he and his wife were no longer living together, and that she recalls advising him that "the basis for the decision was his admissions made to me on July 22, 1992 as well as information I received indicating that Suzanne Lavoie [Kagai's wife] was moving to a new address with her friend Melita and no mention was made to David Kagai's name to Social Services". Ms. Jaworski does not recall then discussing with him other factors included in her report.
