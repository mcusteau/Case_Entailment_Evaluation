In examination of Mr. Kagai he denies he was told on July 31 that his permit would not be extended because he was no longer living with his wife and he denies he was told that the basis for that decision was his own admissions made on July 22 and that the department had information that his wife was moving to a new address with her friend without any mention of his name to Social Services. He does acknowledge that he was told it had been concluded that his was a marriage of convenience, that he would have to leave the country and that he was told by Ms. Jaworski that she had "received information from somebody saying me and my wife were not living together". He states that when he was told of the information from some third party he asked that that person be called to present whatever information or proof he (or she) had, and further that his wife was with him at the time of that meeting on July 31 but that Ms. Jaworski refused to interview both him and his wife at the same time. He did not refer, in his examination, to any other statement or offer by him at that meeting about possible evidence that he would be prepared to bring forward to establish that he and his wife were living together.
