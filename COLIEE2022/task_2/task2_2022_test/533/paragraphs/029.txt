To do so would ignore the fact that the immigration officer had received information from other sources which indicated that the applicant and his wife were no longer living together, a fact made known to the applicant, as admitted in his examination on March 17, 1993, though it would appear this was made known to him on July 31, if not at the earlier meeting on July 22. To grant the relief sought by the applicant without assessing the evidence except to find that there were different versions of what transpired at two meetings would implicitly require this court to conclude that the applicant's version of events should be preferred, at least for purposes of this application for judicial review, and that he was not aware of the concern of the officer, acting on behalf of the Minister, about the continuing arrangements of his marriage and thus had no opportunity to respond to that concern.
