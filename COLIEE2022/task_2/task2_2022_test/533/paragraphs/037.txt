[37]
After deliberation I conclude that on the facts of this case, since the applicant was aware of the serious reservations concerning the continuing arrangements of his marriage, in particular whether he and his wife were living together, and had an opportunity to respond to that concern before the decision not to extend the permit was made, and thereafter, it cannot be said that he was treated unfairly in the process by which the decision here in question was made and maintained by representatives of the respondent. In these circumstances, I do not agree that the question stated on behalf of the applicant is raised by the facts of this case. I thus decline to state a serious question of general importance which would warrant consideration by the Court of Appeal.
