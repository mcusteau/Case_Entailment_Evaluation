That report included a number of references to Mr. Kagai's marital situation. It includes, inter alia, her own opinion, apparently of the time of the original grant of the Minister's permit in August 1991, that the marriage was not bona fide but was one of convenience to facilitate both parties, the applicant by gaining permanent residence in Canada and his wife having someone to help her and her child for a while. It records information from an unnamed source that as of June 1, 1992, the applicant and his wife were not living together, that there was not room in the apartment after the wife's friend moved in and so the applicant had to move out. It also records that the wife of the applicant was then on welfare and had made arrangements to move to low rental housing with her friend Melita and without mention of her husband to Social Services. The report concludes
"In view of the fact that marriage has now disolved [sic] and it was a marriage of convenience in first place also taking into account [another factor] I recommend that Minister's Permit not be renewed as he would no longer fall under Family Class."
