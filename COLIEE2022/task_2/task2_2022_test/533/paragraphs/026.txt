That report was not made available to the applicant at the meeting on July 31 or thereafter, until it formed part of the record of the officer concerned filed in relation to the application for leave in this matter. Some matters included in it are said by the affidavit of Ms. Jaworski to have been communicated orally to Mr. Kagai, with the decision that his permit would not be renewed, when he met with her on July 31. Ms. Jaworski's notes made at that meeting are very brief, and include no reference to any comments by the applicant about his living together with his wife. The notes set out:
"Subject was advised that we will not continue processing his case in Canada as he and his wife are no longer living together.
"Subject was also advised that he will be receiving letter from our office advising him of this.
"Subject did not at all seem conserned [sic] that he will have to separate from his wife, he said that she could go with him if she wants.
"his only concern was if he will be allowed to leave on his own."
