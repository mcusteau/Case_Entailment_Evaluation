[8]
The plaintiff filed a Statement of Claim on July 8, 1996 claiming that he was the sole heir of the estate entitled to the use and possession of Lot 226 and that neither the business nor assets of the business were part of the estate. Immediately upon filing the claim, the plaintiff sought an interim order on an ex parte basis for interim possession of the land and operation and control of the business. An interim order was granted by this Court in favour of the plaintiff on July 9, 1996, to continue for a period of 10 days. The plaintiff's motion for an interlocutory injunction, which had been adjourned to July 26, 1996, was subsequently adjourned sine die. There is no indication of any further procedural steps being taken by the plaintiff to move the proceeding forward after July 26, 1996.
