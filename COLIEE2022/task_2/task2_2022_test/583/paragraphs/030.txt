In
Multibond Inc. v. Duracoat Powder Manufacturing Inc.
[see footnote 1], MacGillis, J., reviewed the rules established by the Court relating to case management and commented as follows:
"The
Rules
have equipped the Court with various procedural tools to enable it to assume an active role in the management and supervision of cases with a view to ensuring that litigation proceeds in a timely and efficient manner. An integral part of the case management scheme in the
Rules
involves the conduct of a status review in circumstances where a party has failed to comply with certain time frames in a proceeding. Rules 380 to 382 govern the procedure to be followed on a status review. ...
"By virtue of rule 380(2), a status review is to be conducted on the basis of written representations, unless the Court directs otherwise. The discretionary powers of the Court on a status review are clearly delineated in rule 382(2). In the case of delay occasioned by a plaintiff, rule 383(2)(a) permits the Court to require a plaintiff '... to show cause why the proceeding should not be dismissed for delay'. If the Court is not satisfied on the show cause hearing that the proceeding should continue, the proceeding may be dismissed. Conversely, if the Court is satisfied that the proceeding should continue, it may order '... that it continue as a specially managed proceeding and make an order under Rule 385'."
