The plaintiff responds that the order allowing the action to continue was ambiguous in that the parties were also been given an option to request dispute resolution. The plaintiff understood that the order permitted the matter to "essentially stand down" until such time as there was resolution with respect to the dispute resolution conference requested. He contends that in the circumstances it was reasonable to explore this option. Moreover, the delay in taking action can be explained as it arose from communication problems between the plaintiff and his two counsel occasioned by intervening absences and holidays.
