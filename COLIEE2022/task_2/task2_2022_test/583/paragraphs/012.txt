On July 12, 1999, counsel for the plaintiff wrote the Registry as follows:
"Further to the order of the Prothonotary directing that a Notice of Motion for stated case be served and filed by this date, I am writing to advise that there has been a delay in getting the signed material from Sault Ste. Marie and that I will be filing a Motion Record, including a request for extension of time, within the next few days."
