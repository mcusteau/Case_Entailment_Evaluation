[27]
The defendants' motion for an extension of time is supported by the uncontradicted affidavit of Alice Corbi√®re in which she asserts that the defendants could not act until the plaintiff complied with the order dated November 19, 1999 requiring him to serve and file his affidavit material by November 26, 1999. The defendants assert that the plaintiff requested an order from the Court and, once granted, failed to abide by its terms. They submit that it was reasonable in the circumstances to wait to ascertain whether the plaintiff would in fact be filing an affidavit.
