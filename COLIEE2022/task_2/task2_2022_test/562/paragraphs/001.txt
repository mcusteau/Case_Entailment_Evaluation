Mactavish, J.
: Kevin Brown is a federal inmate serving a 25 year sentence for a variety of serious offenses. In April of 2003, an inmate, who shall be referred to in these reasons as JB, accused Mr. Brown of having assaulted him. Although Mr. Brown was charged criminally with assault, these charges were subsequently withdrawn. However, information relating to the allegations of assault remains on Mr. Brown's institutional "Preventative Security" and "Offender Management System" files, despite his repeated attempts to have it removed.
