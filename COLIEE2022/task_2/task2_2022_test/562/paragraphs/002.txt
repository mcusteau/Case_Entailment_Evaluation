By this application for judicial review, Mr. Brown seeks to review a third level grievance decision refusing to remove all information relating to the allegations of assault from his file. For the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that there are portions of the "Security Intelligence Report" relating to this matter that are not accurate, up to date and complete. Accordingly, this application for judicial review will be allowed, and the decision of the Commissioner's delegate set aside, insofar as it relates to specific portions of the document in question.
