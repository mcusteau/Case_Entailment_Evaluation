I do not accept Mr. Brown's contention that this type of information should not be placed on his institutional files. Not only did he not offer any support for his contention, but it seems to me that having this sort of information readily available is especially important where, as in this case, Mr. Brown is serving a lengthy sentence, and may be required to deal with a variety of Correctional Service personnel over the life of his sentence in a number of different institutions.
