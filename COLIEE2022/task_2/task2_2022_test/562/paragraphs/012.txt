[12]
As a result of concerns expressed by the Court as to the ability of the Court to address the issues raised in the application without seeing the Report itself, a copy of the Report was produced by the respondent after the hearing. Each party was given an opportunity to make further submissions in writing, addressing the specific wording of the report. Counsel for Mr. Brown chose to avail himself of that opportunity. The respondent did not.
