Before addressing the submissions of each of the parties in this case, reference should be made to the way in which this hearing unfolded. The Security Intelligence Report itself was not included in either party's record, and was thus not before the Court when the application was heard. As a result, the parties' submissions as to what was and was not in the Report were made in something of a vacuum.
