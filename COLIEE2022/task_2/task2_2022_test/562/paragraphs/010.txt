[10]
Mr. Brown now seeks judicial review of this decision, asserting that the Correctional Service of Canada failed to take reasonable steps to ensure that JB's allegation that he had been assaulted by Mr. Brown was accurate, up to date and complete. Having failed to do so, Mr. Brown says the decision of the Commissioner's delegate was unreasonable, and should be set aside.
