Mr. Brown says that he was in a meeting with several Correctional Service of Canada personnel, including the Warden of Warkworth Institution, between 11 am and 12 noon on the day in question. The Warden subsequently confirmed Mr. Brown's presence at the meeting, and in August of 2003, the criminal charges that had been laid against Mr. Brown were withdrawn by the Crown Attorney charged with responsibility for the case, who evidently felt that in light of all of the available information, including Mr. Brown's alibi, there was no longer a reasonable prospect of conviction.
