Snider, J.
: Mr. Seref Sinan, his wife, Sennur Sinan, and their two children, Furkan Sinan and Gokhan Sinan (collectively referred to as the "Applicants"), citizens of Turkey, arrived in Canada on May 16, 2002 and claim to be Convention refugees. Mr. Sinan fears persecution based on his political opinion and Alevi religion. As members of the same family, the other Applicants' fear of persecution is tied to that of Mr. Sinan. After a hearing before the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Board"), their claim was denied in a decision dated November 29, 2002.
