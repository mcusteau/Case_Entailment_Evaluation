The central issue for the Board was credibility. The Board found that there was insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to determine the well-foundedness of Mr. Sinan's refugee claims. There were numerous inconsistencies, contradictions and omissions throughout the Applicants' evidence, including among Mr. Sinan's Port of Entry ("POE") notes, the Personal Information Form ("PIF") and his testimony at the hearing. The Board stated:
"[T]he panel finds that while the discrepancies and contradictions considered individually might have seemed insignificant, when taken together and considered in context they support a finding of lack of credibility."
