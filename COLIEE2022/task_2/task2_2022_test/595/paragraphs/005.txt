The Board canvassed the documentary evidence available to them and found the following:
· Being Alevi is not, on its own, a sufficient reason to fear oppression. There is some discrimination against Alevis but no systematic oppression of all Alevis.
· Alevis who are vocal in terms of criticizing the state or who appear to be communists, "may expect 'ruder' treatment by police and other authorities".
· Alevi Kurds are not persecuted but, rather, vulnerable to suspicion, gross prejudice and mistreatment due to their perceived political opinion.
