During the course of the hearing, numerous inconsistencies were put to Mr. Sinan. The Board considered his explanations for these inconsistencies and explained, in clear terms, why these explanations were not accepted. Just because an applicant gives an explanation does not mean that the explanation must be accepted by the Board. It is open to the Board to consider the response or explanation and determine whether it is sufficient. I see no example in this case where the Board ignored an explanation.
