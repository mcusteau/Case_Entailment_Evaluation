It is apparent from a review of the record, including the transcript of the hearing itself, that there were numerous inconsistencies in the evidence of the Applicants. Although the Applicants have attempted to explain some of them away, the overwhelming effect of the totality of the testimony is that it is not credible. This is not a case of a Board picking apart minute details of the evidence, as in Owusu-Ansah v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 98 N.R. 312 (F.C.A.). Rather, the inconsistencies pointed out by the Board go to significant and important matters.
