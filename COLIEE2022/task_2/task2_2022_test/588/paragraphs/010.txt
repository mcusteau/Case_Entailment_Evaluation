In my view, however, a simple reading of the decision discloses that the IRB clearly considered and analyzed the applicant's claim on the basis of his alleged membership in the particular social class of his family. Moreover, a large number of cases decided by this Court have established that the IRB is not bound by the result in another claim, even if the claim involves a relative, because refugee status is determined on a case by case basis, and because it is possible that the other decision was incorrect (see,

Rahmatizadeh v Minister of Employment and Immigration,
[1994] F.C.J. No. 578 (F.C.T.D.) (QL);
Museghe v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
2001 FCT 1117;
Singh v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
2002 FCT 1013;
Matlija v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
2003 FCT 704;
Gjergo v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
2004 FC 303 and
Bromberg v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration,
2002 FCT 939). Therefore, in my view, the IRB did not fail to consider the criterion of membership in the particular social group of his family.
