The applicant's refugee claim was heard before the Board on March 7, 2007. On July 3, 2007, the Board found that the applicant was not a Convention refugee on the basis that he lacked a well-founded fear of persecution. While the Board accepted the applicant's identity and his membership in the CUD, it drew a number of negative inferences on the basis of inconsistencies and implausibilities in the applicant's testimony. These negative findings included:
1. the applicant did not attend the demonstration on June 8, 2005 that was the alleged cause of his arrest and detention;
2. the applicant was not arrested or detained because of his involvement in the June 8, 2005 demonstration;
3. the applicant's failure to claim asylum on three occasions prior to arriving in Canada demonstrated a lack of subjective fear of persecution; and
4. the applicant did not attend a meeting at the Ethiopian embassy in Belgium, and therefore did not anger the Ethiopian ambassador marking him for further persecution should he return to Ethiopia.
The applicant does not challenge any of the foregoing findings in this application for judicial review.
