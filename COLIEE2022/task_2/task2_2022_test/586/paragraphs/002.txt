The applicant, a citizen of Iran, arrived in Canada in 1995 and made an unsuccessful claim for refugee status on the basis of religious persecution. He was deported to Iran in June 1998. The applicant claims that upon his return to Iran, he was detained, interrogated and released on condition that he report weekly to the police. Three months later, he was detained, placed in solitary confinement and tortured for a year. He was then transferred to the general population of the prison, where he spent an additional five years. The applicant was never charged with an offence and did not receive a trial.
