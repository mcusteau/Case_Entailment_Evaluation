In 2004, the applicant was released on condition that he report to the police station monthly. The applicant states that he did this for two months, but then became frightened when he realized that his movements were being tracked by security forces. Fearful that he was being used to reveal the identity of other members of his faith, the applicant fled to Canada on August 24, 2004. He was detained on arrival at Pearson International Airport and found to be inadmissible for the purpose of a refugee claim. However, he was given an opportunity to make an application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA).
