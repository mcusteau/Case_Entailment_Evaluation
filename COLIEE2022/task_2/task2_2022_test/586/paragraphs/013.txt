The applicant submits that it was unfair for the Officer to render a negative decision three days after receiving the PRRA submissions on the basis that no supporting documentary evidence was provided, when the applicant had advised the Officer that evidence would be forthcoming. The respondent, in reply, states that the Officer complied with section 162 of the IRPA Regulations which prescribes that a decision cannot be rendered until 30 days after the applicant was notified of the right to make a PRRA application. As a result, the Officer cannot be faulted. The respondent also points out that the applicant has the right to make a new PRRA application pursuant to section 165 of the Regulations when he receives new evidence.
