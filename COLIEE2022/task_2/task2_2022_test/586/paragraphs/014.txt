In my opinion, it is not a sufficient answer that the Officer waited the minimum statutorily prescribed period before rendering the PRRA decision. The common law duty of fairness requires that an applicant be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence and to participate in the application process, especially where, as here, a negative decision would have a profound impact on the life of the applicant. Haghighi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] 4 F.C. 407 (F.C.A.); Mojzisik v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2004] F.C.J. No. 33 at paragraph 21. In this case, it is evident, with the benefit of hindsight, that the applicant was not given such an opportunity so there was a breach of the duty of fairness.
CONCLUSION
