I agree with the applicant that a breach of procedural fairness arises on the facts of this case. The applicant made a detailed request in his PRRA application for an oral hearing, with specific reference to the factors set out in section 167 of the Regulations. However, the PRRA Officer makes no reference to these factors, or to any other factors that led to the decision not to hold an oral hearing, despite the written request for one. In fact, there is no evidence that the Officer turned his mind to the appropriateness of holding an oral hearing.
