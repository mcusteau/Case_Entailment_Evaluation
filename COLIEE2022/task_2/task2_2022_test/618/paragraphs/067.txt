The plaintiff's argument is to the effect that during her tenure at the COGLA office in Calgary, she was marred by repeated abuse at the hands of Mr. Stalinski, which abuse led to psychological trauma. The plaintiff maintains that the defendant must be held liable for the actions of her servant as these actions were taken within the context of his employment.
