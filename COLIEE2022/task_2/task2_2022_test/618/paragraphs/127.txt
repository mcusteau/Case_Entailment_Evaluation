Section 51 of the
Limitation of Actions Act
of Alberta provides that an action in negligence "... may be commenced within two years after the cause of action arose, and not afterwards". While the negligence alleged by the amended statement of claim is related to the wrongful acts of Mr. Stalinski, it nevertheless raises a distinct and separate ground of action. As the facts on which this additional claim is framed took place back in 1984 and 1985, I must conclude that it cannot be sustained as it was made out of time.
