On August 10, the plaintiff received finger print forms in a personal and confidential envelope addressed to her. These forms were required for security clearance purposes. She went to the local police station to have her finger prints taken and then, pursuant to the written instructions on the forms, forwarded them to Ottawa. On her return, Mr. Stalinski shouted at her for not having informed him that he had received these forms and for having sent the forms directly to Ottawa. He told her that his instructions superseded whatever instructions she received from Ottawa.
