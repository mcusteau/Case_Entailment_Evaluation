Dealing with the first question, it is clear from the evidence that when Mr. Stalinski hired the plaintiff, he was well aware of her mental vulnerability. In my view, Mr. Stalinski did not hire plaintiff despite that vulnerability as he professed, but because of it. He was looking to hire an employee who would readily submit to his control, and plaintiff, because of her apparent fragile state, was a fitting candidate. He exploited that vulnerability from the onset, initially to assert his control and domination over the plaintiff and later, when that failed, with the view of causing her to break down and quit her job. The first thing he did on plaintiff's initial day of employment was to convey to her the fact that he was aware of her mental problem and that she had only gotten the position on paper. The only conceivable reason for those remarks was to make it clear to plaintiff, from the very beginning, that her future with COGLA was wholly within his control.
