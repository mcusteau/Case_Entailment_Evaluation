Finally, plaintiff argues that an amendment to a statement of claim, once duly made, takes effect retroactively from the time when the original document which it amends took effect. It follows, plaintiff argues, that the cause of action in negligence must be held to have been raised in July of 1986, when the original claim was filed. I do not believe that, in the face of a limitation statute, an amendment which alleges a new cause of action can be considered to have been made at a time other than that at which it was actually made, unless the court, in allowing the amendment, actually rules on the issue of limitation. This is not the case here.
