I have referred to the case law with respect to awards under the heading of nervous shock which highlights the distinction between an action framed in negligence and one framed in tort per se, i.e., an intentional tort. The basis for this distinction can be gleaned from a reading of the case law which I canvassed earlier. The cases of
Wilkinson, Rahemtulla
and
Timmermans
involved intentional torts and, in each case, damages were awarded for psychological or emotional distress similar to that from which the plaintiff suffers. Other cases, notably
Guay v. Sun Publishing Company Ltd.
, [1953] 2 S.C.R. 216, and
Heighington v. The Queen
(1987), 60 O.R.(2d) 641, establish that, in an action framed in negligence, recognizable psychiatric illness must be proven, and stress, strain, upset and anxiety are not compensable. The difference of approach in cases of negligence and of tort was commented on by Professor Prosser in
Law of Torts
, 4th Ed. (1971). At page 30, he notes:
"There is a definite tendency to impose greater responsibility upon a defendant whose conduct has been intend to do harm, or morally wrong. More liberal rules are applied as to the consequences for which he will be held liable, the certainty of proof required, and the type of damage for which recovery is to be permitted, as well as the measure of compensation. The defendant's interests have been accorded substantially less weight in opposition to the plaintiff's claim to protection when moral iniquity is thrown into the balance. Apparently the courts have more or less unconsciously worked out an irregular and poorly defined sliding scale, by which the defendant's liability is least where his conduct is merely inadvertent, greater when he acts in disregard of consequences increasingly likely to follow, greater still when he intentionally invades the rights of another under a mistaken belief that he is committing no wrong, and greatest of all where his motive is a malevolent desire to do harm."
