I now turn to the issue of damages. As noted earlier, if Mr. Stalinski knowingly exploited the plaintiff's vulnerability, thereby making her condition extensively worse, I can see no basis whatsoever for allowing the wrongdoer to escape his liability on the ground that the plaintiff had a preexistent vulnerability. That being said, it remains that the award for damages must be measured so as to compensate plaintiff for the actual damages suffered and, in that regard, the plaintiff's preexistent vulnerability is relevant.
