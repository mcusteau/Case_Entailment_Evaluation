This has been the law in Canada for some time. In
Her Majesty the Queen v. Levy Brothers Inc.
, [1961] S.C.R. 189, Mr. Justice Ritchie, in a case involving the theft of a parcel of diamonds by officers of the Customs Postal Branch, stated:
"Customs officers are required by s. 44(3) of the
Post Office Act
... to 'deal with' dutiable mail in accordance with the laws relating to customs pending delivery to the addressee or return to Canada Post Office, and it was in the course of so dealing with the respondent's parcel of diamonds that an employee or employees of the Crown converted them to his or their own use.
The employee or employees concerned were thus doing fraudulently that which they were employed to do honestly and the theft was therefore, in my view, committed under circumstances as to render the employer liable for the loss
. The law governing these circumstances has been stated in
Story on Agency
, 7th Ed. para. 452, in terms which have been approved in this court on more than one occasion. It is there said:
'... he (the principal) is held liable to third persons in a civil suit for the frauds, deceits, concealments, misrepresentations, torts, negligences, and other malfeasances, or misfeasances, and omissions of duty, of his agent, in the course of his employment, although the principal did not authorize, or justify, or participate in, or, indeed, know of such misconduct, or even if he forbade the acts, or disapproved of them.'"
