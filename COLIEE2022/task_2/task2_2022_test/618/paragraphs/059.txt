On December 4, the plaintiff left the outer door opened and locked the inner door in order to allow some air into the room. Mr. Stalinski came in and left both doors open. The plaintiff again locked the inner door. When Mr. Stalinski returned a few minutes later, he became furious and yelled at the plaintiff, ordering her to keep the inner door unlocked. Later that day, the plaintiff went to the filing cabinet to log a mail entry and found a square-ended screwdriver in the cabinet where the hammer had been left previously.
