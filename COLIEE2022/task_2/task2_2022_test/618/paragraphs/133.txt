[133]
On the original claim, judgment is awarded to plaintiff in the amount of $40,000. Interest shall be calculated pursuant to the Alberta
Judgment Interest Act
, c. J-0.5. The
Act
states that prejudgment interest shall be awarded when the cause of action arose. Given the nature of the claim which essentially deals with the cumulative effect of various acts, I believe the effective date to be January 4, 1985.
