[102]
The case law on this point originates with the case of
Wilkinson v. Downton
, [1897] 2 Q.B. 57. In this case, a verbal hoax misfired and caused nervous shock to the person of the plaintiff. Wright, J., said:
"The defendant has, as I assume for the moment, wilfully done an act calculated to cause physical harm to the plaintiff - that is to say, to infringe her legal right to personal safety, and has in fact thereby caused physical harm to her. That proposition without more appears to me to state a good cause of action, there being no justification alleged for the act. This wilful injuria is in law malicious, although no malicious purpose to cause the harm which was caused nor any motive of spite is imputed to the defendant."
