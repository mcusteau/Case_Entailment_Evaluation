Plaintiff recognized so much but argued that the defendant was estopped from raising the limitation period as a defence by reason of the consent which was given to the filing of the amended statement of claim. In my view, the defendant was not thereby estopped from raising any defence. In fact, the amendment was granted subject to the defendant's unlimited right to respond by way of an amended defence, and it was open to the defendant to raise the statute of limitation as a defence at the time of filing of the amended defence.
