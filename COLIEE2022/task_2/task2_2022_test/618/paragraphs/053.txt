On November 13, the plaintiff received a notice of contributory status form from the Department of Supply and Services, Superannuation Division. She could not locate the incoming envelope to identify the return address. She passed a note to Mr. Stalinski asking whether he had the envelope and if so, whether it could be returned to her. Mr. Stalinski became very upset and asked why she wanted the envelope. After some dispute, Mr. Stalinski told her that he had torn the envelope in pieces and thrown it into the wastepaper basket, and then ordered her out of his office. The plaintiff returned to the office a few minutes later with a note indicating that she would like to have the torn up pieces. Mr. Stalinski later relinquished the pieces to the plaintiff, but only after having consulted with Mr. Klaubert. The plaintiff again wrote to Mr. Klaubert to complain about these events.
