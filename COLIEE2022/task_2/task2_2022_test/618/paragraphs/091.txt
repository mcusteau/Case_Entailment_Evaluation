Ms. Houlding recognized during cross-examination that the plaintiff had discussed with her the subsequent events of sexual harassment which allegedly occurred while she was in the employ of the City of Calgary. She stated that the plaintiff had become hypervigilant as a result of the COGLA experience, and that she had been surprised by the fact that the plaintiff had been able to keep her subsequent employment as long as she did.
