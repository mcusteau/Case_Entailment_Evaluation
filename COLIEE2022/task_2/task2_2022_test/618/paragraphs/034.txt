In light of the seriousness of the allegations made by the plaintiff, Mr. Stewart decided to visit the Calgary office. On August 29, he interviewed the plaintiff and Mr. Stalinski separately. Mr. Stalinski was very upset that the plaintiff had involved Ottawa officials into private office matters, and with the fact that his actions were being questioned. On August 28, he forwarded to Mr. Don Sherwin, the Director General, Resource Evaluation Branch in Ottawa, a formal recommendation that the plaintiff's employment be terminated. This recommendation was not acted upon.
