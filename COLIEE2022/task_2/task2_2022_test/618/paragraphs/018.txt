On July 13, the plaintiff was asked to fill out a personal history form. She wanted explanations as to the reasons for this form but Mr. Stalinski scolded her for having asked. Later, after having encountered difficulties in filling out the form and not wanting to seek help from Mr. Stalinski, plaintiff phoned Ottawa for assistance. While she was on the phone, Mr. Stalinski came in, ordered her off the phone and warned her that all subsequent communications to Ottawa had to go through him.
