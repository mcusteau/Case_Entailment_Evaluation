In the meantime, the problems continued in the COGLA office. On August 31, the plaintiff asked Mr. Stalinski whether he might allow her $2 from the petty cash so that she could purchase a dust mask. She stated that the file room which she was reorganizing had accumulated dust which she believed could be harmful to her health. Mr. Stalinski's diary reveals the following with respect to this request:
"84-08-31 - 10:30
"Miss Boothman makes a request 'to take a couple of bucks from petty cash to get a mask that is used around sprays and dust' because in her view, it is warranted. She feels the dust from the files is injurious to her health. She was informed that her request would be considered.
"84-08-31 - 10:31
"Miss Boothman is called into my office to be given an alternative task to perform while I consult with Ottawa over her unusual request. She asks when she will get her mask, and is informed that the matter is under consideration as to whether I felt the government ought to incur that particular cost. She became somewhat louder and was insistent that this must be done. At this point a visitor (visitors) entered, and to maintain privacy for a short period of time I shut the door. Miss Boothman rushed up and loudly proclaimed she would not be in an office with me with the door closed. I told Miss Boothman to, then, sit at her desk until I was ready to continue.

"Miss Boothman did not come when requested, but rather quips 'I'll be there in a sec Tom!'. About a minute later when she came in, she was asked for an explanation for her absence. She replied that she was on a coffee break. Upon further questioning it was admitted, by Miss Boothman, that she had also been to the self-serve store asking for dust masks. Upon attempting to give oral instructions to Miss Boothman regarding her alternate task, it was decided it would be easier to type them to make matters clear.
"84-08-31 - 13:05
"Miss Boothman is informed that dust masks will be purchased for her use before she will be expected to continue the task earlier assigned. She is also instructed that she is not authorized to make enquiries at the self-serve store, and ought to make all requests, for whatever, to me (as long as I am not to be away for an extended period of time). She made the remark that there might be times when she would have to 'use her own discretion' in making enquiries as to the availability of anything in the DSS store. She was informed that
all
requests for materials for use in the office
must
be made through me and that she was
not
authorized to undertake independent action. Miss Boothman gave indications that she was about to argue, and was therefore dismissed from my office."
