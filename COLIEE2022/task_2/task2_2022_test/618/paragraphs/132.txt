[132]
For the above reasons, I must come to the conclusion that the cause of action in negligence raised by the amended statement of claim was barred by statute at the time it was made and, hence, cannot succeed. I had reserved the issue of costs on plaintiff's motion to amend her statement of claim. In the circumstances, I have concluded that no order should be made in that regard.
