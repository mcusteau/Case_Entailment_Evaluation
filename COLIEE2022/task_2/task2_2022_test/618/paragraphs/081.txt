During the trial, two experts were called by the plaintiff and their reports were filed as read. These reports relate to the impact of the COGLA events on the plaintiff's mental health. Dr. Frank Schnell, who is the plaintiff's family physician, stated that he had the plaintiff under his care from May 1986 to September 1989, and that during that time, plaintiff consulted him on seventeen occasions. With respect to the plaintiff's condition, he states:
"The following point from list contributes symptoms taken directly from writings communicated to me by Ms. Boothman during my appointments and encounters with her:
(a) Symptoms and conditions that are the result of a 'torture' via methods and behaviour applied to deliberately fragment or breakdown her personality or identity structure and destroy her self-worth resulting in dismissal from her said employment.
(b) Intense emotional pain, crying and frequent episodes that are experienced as the result of her understanding that she has been scapegoated, lied to, slandered, unable to reach others for help, undervalued, and not believed. She feels that this has been intensified by her inability to find other employment.
(c) Patient experiences intense worry, periodic anxiety attacks, periodic despair, acute reactive depression, occasional suicidal feelings, feels of persecution, general physical phenomena which she describes as being accompanied by intense chest pains, difficulty breathing, crying, and grieving.
(d) Ms. Boothman feels that her symptoms are intensified by social isolation in crises, by feelings of aloneness with the problems, and by the affirmations of her counsellor that nobody cares.
(e) Ms. Boothman relates to me that the symptoms reappear or recur with acute intensity in association with events or experiences similar to the original traumas when the patient feels she is not believed, or when she feels she is not heard when communicating pertinent information particularly to people in investigating or helping roles."
