On July 19, Mr. Stalinski set out to teach the plaintiff how to open the office safe. The plaintiff had some difficulty with the instructions and, after a few unsuccessful attempts, she was berated by Mr. Stalinski. He ordered her to sit in front of the safe and continue to practice as he stood over her watching her every move. After repeated insults, the plaintiff was reduced to tears.
