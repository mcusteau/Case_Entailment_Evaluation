[109]
I can see no difference in law between the case where a servant who, entrusted with the supervision of personnel, abuses that authority in the manner described in these reasons, and that of a servant entrusted with the care of goods who converts those goods for his or her own use. In both cases, the wrong is directly attributable and connected to the duty or responsibility conferred on the servant.
