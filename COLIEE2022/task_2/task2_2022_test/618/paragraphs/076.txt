In addition to these repeated threats, Mr. Stalinski continuously sought to control and dominate the plaintiff. He specifically ordered the plaintiff to have no contact with Ottawa on any matter and made it his prerogative to review any and all requests made by the plaintiff. He listened in on her telephone conversations. He made it a point to exploit the plaintiff's sensitivities with derogatory comments about her abilities and her emotional and psychological health. This pattern of behaviour continued in the presence of third parties as was evidenced by Mr. Stalinski berating the plaintiff in front of his wife. Mr. Stalinski wasted no efforts in showing the plaintiff that he held her future in his hands. In fact, on several occasions, Mr. Stalinski would threaten the plaintiff's job. He tried to tighten his hold on the plaintiff by warning her that her every move would be noted by him. He tampered with her work station. While these latter actions may seem somewhat trivial taken in isolation, Mr. Stalinski was well aware of the fact that, in the case of the plaintiff, they were engendering extreme emotional reactions.
