On September 6, Mr. Stewart phoned Mr. Stalinski to inquire as to the state of affairs in the office. The essence of this conversation was recorded by Mr. Stalinski as follows:
"84-09-06 - 13:20
"John Stewart called asking how things were. He was told there was no appreciable change and that her attitude was abominable. He mentioned that he had a chap from EMR Procurement call Detective Harger regarding the fraud problem and procurement procedures. I mentioned I was aware that there were a number of incidents. Quite obviously Miss Boothman has been bending Ottawa's ear as far as this problem is concerned, as well. Interesting that she did not consider it necessary to tell me she felt it necessary to involve Ottawa."
