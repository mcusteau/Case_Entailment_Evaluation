During the interview, however, Mr. Stalinski had apprehensions relating to the plaintiff's psychological health. After the interview, he consulted a Manpower officer who had had prior occasion to speak to the plaintiff. His concerns having seemingly been put to rest, he then telephoned the plaintiff to offer her the position. In a later memorandum to senior management, Mr. Stalinski refers to his impressions of the plaintiff during the interview as follows:
"Throughout the interview she was extremely nervous, and more than once she was stopped, told to relax, and give the response that she felt the interviewer wanted made. In addition, throughout the interview, she did not once make normal contact. This lack of contact caused me to have certain reservations. My concern was that Miss Boothman was exhibiting mannerisms also exhibited by a former employee who had some rather serious personality disorders that made it impossible for them to function in a normal work environment. It was, then, as a result of these specific concerns that I consulted with a contact in the Federal Service that had been in a position to speak with Miss Boothman on a number of occasions.
"My concerns were expressed and my contact responded that they had not seen this particular problem, but that it was entirely possible it had been missed insofar as they thought I was a rather perceptive person, and they too expressed concern. The circumstances were discussed, at length, and upon conclusion of the conversation we both felt that the likely cause of the behaviour exhibited by Miss Boothman was as a result of her personal circumstances at that time, and that, given time, she would likely prove to be an asset.
"The end result of the entire interview process was that, as a consequence of Miss Boothman's obvious intelligence, and because of the fact that she did, in fact, place first in the interview questions, and because of her personal circumstances, the position would be offered to her. On my recommendation, and with unvoiced reservations on my part, this was done."
