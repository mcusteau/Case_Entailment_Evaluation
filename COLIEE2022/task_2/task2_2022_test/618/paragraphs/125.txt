[125]
At the end of the hearing on the original statement of claim, I pointed out to counsel for the plaintiff, during argument, that he was seeking recovery on grounds which were not reflected by the statement of claim. It is a result of this comment that plaintiff moved to amend her statement of claim under rule 420. Counsel for the defendant consented to the amendment on terms that he be allowed to file an amended defence and that he be allowed to adduce evidence on the new allegations.
