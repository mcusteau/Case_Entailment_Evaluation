The Court of Appeal provided similar directions to the Board in
Attakora v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1989), 99 N.R. 168 (F.C.A.) at p. 170:
"These two findings together, which occur towards the end of the Board's reasons, satisfy both the objective and the subjective branches of the test for refugee status. Whether or not the applicant was a credible witness, and I have already indicated that the board's reasons for finding him not credible are based in error, that does not prevent him from being a refugee if his political opinions and activities are likely to lead to his arrest and punishment. In those circumstances, the only conclusion that was open to the board was to find that the applicant was indeed a Convention refugee.
"I would allow the s. 28 application, set aside the impugned decision
and return the matter to the board for redetermination on the basis that the applicant is a Convention refugee
." (underlining added)
