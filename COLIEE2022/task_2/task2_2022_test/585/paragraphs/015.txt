Section 18.1(3) authorizes the Trial Division, on judicial review to, among other things, "order a federal board ... to do any act" or to "declare invalid ... a decision ... of a board" or to "prohibit ... a decision ... of a board" or to "set aside and refer back for determination in accordance with such directions as it considers to be appropriate ... a decision ... of a board". It would not be consistent with the wording of the section as a whole, and the extensive authority given to the Trial Division thereby, to limit the power of making directions so as to exclude therefrom the making of directions which are so specific that they direct the result the tribunal must reach.
