I am not persuaded by that argument. I note that Madame Justice Desjardins has commented on the former s. 52(d) in the light of the new provisions, see
Review of Administrative Action in the Federal Court of Canada: The New Style in a Pluralist Setting
, Law Society of Upper Canada Special Lectures, 1992, 405 at pp. 410-411:
"Once the grounds for intervention are met, the court is entitled to review the decision. The power of the Court of Appeal, under
the former para. 52(d)
of the
Federal Court Act
, was limited to setting aside the decision and referring the matter back to the tribunal for determination in accordance with such directions as it considered to be appropriate.
These directions may sometimes amount to instructing the tribunal as to the decision it ought to render
. Still, the court cannot, as it can in the case of appeal, deal with the merits of the case and render the decision the tribunal should have rendered. Whether the new subs. 18.1(3) changes the situation will be discussed later.

"Appeals and judicial review are closely intertwined in federal legislation. What I mean by 'intertwined' is illustrated by the fact that certain provisions found in some federal legislation are marked 'appeal' but the grounds of intervention are those of judicial review. But, since the powers of the court are different, both counsel and judges must concentrate at all times on the precise nature of the recourse brought before the court ...
. . . . .
"The
Immigration Act
, as it is presently in force, perhaps more than any other federal legislation, contains numerous examples of mixed statutory review/appeal provisions. Many appeals in immigration matters are provided on the same grounds as judicial review proceedings.
"When a decision is given by an adjudicator, (for instance, a removal order) or by the first level tribunal, leave may be obtained to commence a proceeding in the nature of a s. 28 application. When the decision is given by the Refugee Division, leave to appeal may be obtained.
"
In s. 28 applications, the Federal Court of Appeal will often return the matter with directions which amount to instructing the tribunal as to the decision it ought to render. The result is sometimes very close to a decision on the merits
, but the court cannot render that decision.
"In the case of an appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal may, if it allows the appeal, set aside the decision. It may then return the matter for rehearing as it often feels it does not have all the evidence before it. If, however, it feels all the evidence is before it and that no other conclusion is possible, the court may render the decision the Refugee Division should have rendered. The court is authorized to do so under subpara. 52(c)(i) of the
Federal Court Act
