In
Chaudri v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1986), 69 N.R. 114 (F.C.A.) at p. 117, the Court of Appeal allowed the application for review pursuant to s. 28 and referred the matter back to the Immigration Appeal Board with the following instructions;
"In the circumstance, it appears to me that, if the board had not committed the errors which I have indicated,
it could only have come to the conclusion that the applicant had satisfied the definition of the Convention Refugee
. In my opinion,
the matter should be referred back to the board for redetermination on that basis
." (underlining added)
