A similar remedy was granted in
Bindra v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1992), 151 N.R. 43; 18 Imm. L.R.(2d) 114 (F.C.A.), where it was clear from the evidence accepted by the panel that the only conclusion it could have reached, were it not for its error, was that the claimant had a credible basis. The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the application under s. 28 for judicial review of a credible basis decision, and remitted the matter for reconsideration with the following directions, at p. 117:
"The application should be granted, the decision of the access tribunal should be set aside and the matter should be referred back to the access tribunal for reconsideration on the basis that the applicant has a credible basis for his claim since the only possible basis for rejection in the circumstances was the internal flight alternative."
