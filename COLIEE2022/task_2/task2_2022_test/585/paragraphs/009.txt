Section 52(d) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 was repealed by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 17. It was replaced in the context of the reorganization of judicial review jurisdiction, between the Trial Division and Appeal Division, which was effected by that amendment. Section 18.1(3) was added and s. 28 was modified to read:
"S. 28(2) Sections 18 to 18.5, except subs. 18.4(2), apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, in respect of any matter within the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under subs. (1) and, where they so apply, a reference to the Trial Division shall be read as a reference to the Court of Appeal." (S.C. 1990, c. 8, ss. 5 and 8)
