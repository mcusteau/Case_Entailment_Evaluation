After again analyzing why Alta Flights' actions, if successful, would not be covered by the exception outlined in s. 7(1)(b), the Privacy Commissioner surveys the possibility of attempts under
PIPEDA
. In the Privacy Commissioner's opinion, if the Court finds the tape recorder surreptitiously placed by Ms. Hobbs in the smoke room did not record any conversations of its employees, there can be no "collection" of personal information. If the Court finds that conversations were recorded prior to the inadvertent erasure of the tape, however, the Privacy Commissioner argues that contrary to the decision reached by this Court in
Eastmond
, supra, Alta Flights did collect personal information in violation of
PIPEDA
; and this, despite the fact that no Alta Flights personnel actually was able to listen to or otherwise use the content of these conversations.
