The Applicant states that where there is a statutory right (in this case, to privacy) with no expressed sanction for a breach of such right, there is prima facie an implied right to be compensated for any breach of this right. Section 16 of
PIPEDA
allows for remedies, including damages to the complainant for humiliation arising from the collection and use of personal information, and the Applicant contends this should include the attempt to collect and use such information. In other words, the Applicant claims that the common law principle of attempts applies to
PIPEDA
, and that this Court has jurisdiction to remedy such an attempt.
