Ms. Morgan was employed as a Customer Service Representative with Alta Flights at the Flight Tech Aviation Shell Aerocentre (the "Aerocentre") in Edmonton, Alberta, from September 7, 2000, to April 5, 2003. On the evening of April 1, 2003, while in the "smoke room" that was ordinarily used by Alta Flights employees, as well as occasionally by other Aerocentre employees and other groups, she and another employee of Alta Flights discovered a digital recorder that had been attached to the underside of a coffee table.
