While exercising its discretion de novo, the Court will give less deference to the decision of the Privacy Commissioner than it would otherwise, some due regard is warranted toward the factors taken into consideration by the Privacy Commissioner in balancing the privacy interests of the complainant and the employer's legitimate interest in protecting its employees and property: see
Eastmond
, supra at paras. 122 to 124; see also
Englander
, supra at para. 33 (F.C.), 71 (F.C.A.). However, the question of whether or not a breach under
PIPEDA
occurs when a violation is attempted, is a question of interpretation under the
Act
, and so should be reviewed on a standard of correctness.
Alta Flights' actions and PIPEDA
Did Alta Flights violate any provisions of PIPEDA, and specifically those dealing with the collection and/or the use of personal information by either recording or attempting to record employees' conversations? Does the fact that the recorded material, if any, was erased prior to being put to any use, change this answer?
