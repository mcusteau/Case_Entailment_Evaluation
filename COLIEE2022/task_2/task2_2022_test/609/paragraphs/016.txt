The Applicant submits that since the central question at issue is one of law - that is, whether the provisions of
PIPEDA
include a prohibition on the
attempt
to collect and disclose personal information - minimal deference ought to be given to the Privacy Commissioner's decision and the Court should exercise its discretion to decide the question de novo (see
Englander
, supra, at paras. 29-30 (F.C.), 47-48 (F.C.A.)). It should be noted that the decision of the Privacy Commissioner is not, in this case, being reviewed under ss. 47 and 48 of
PIPEDA
, but rather, under s. 14. Therefore, the complaint, along with all the available evidence, is to be dealt with de novo. The Court may rely on the decision of the Privacy Commissioner or certain parts of it where applicable in arriving at a determination, but it is not bound to do so.
