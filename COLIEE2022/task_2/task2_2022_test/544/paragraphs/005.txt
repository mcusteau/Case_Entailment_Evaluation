One of the most significant factors in any assessment is the applicant's possibility of employment in Canada. Points are accordingly awarded both for occupational demand in the proper screening step, and for experience in the final assessment. This process requires reference to the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (C.C.D.O.), a seven volume manual which classifies and describes a myriad of occupations. Assessment of any one intended occupation begins with a matching of the applicant's work routine with a specific occupation from the C.C.D.O.
