The applicant attended an interview at the Canadian Consulate in San Francisco on September 28, 1988. The applicant is critical of the visa officer's conduct of this interview, which he states lasted "something a little bit more than half an hour". The applicant states that during the interview he tried to explain the nature of his work to the visa officer, but that the officer formed the impression that the applicant sold only hand held calculators, on a retail basis. The applicant contends that his offer to bring evidence which would speak to the true nature of his employment was refused. The remainder of the interview has been described by the applicant in his affidavit as follows:
"11. He [the visa officer] asked me who my customers were, one of whom is Shoemart. Shoemart is the top major retailing company in the Philippines, employing thousands of people. It is a company similar to Simpsons and Eatons although its name is Shoemart because the original company primarily sold only shoes many many years ago. Although this fact could easily be checked, the visa officer refused to accept my explanation as to who Shoemart was and suggested why would a shoe company sell calculators.
"12. The officer refused to accept my explanation that retail sales are only four percent of my total sales, the rest being wholesale, nor that my line of products include personal computers, sophisticated financial calculators for banks and printing calculators for offices. The officer seemed to be rushing through the interview which commenced at about 5:00 p.m. The officer refused to acknowledge both my present and past experience as a sales representative as contained in my resume."
