On April 24, 1989, the applicant received a letter from the Canadian Consulate General in San Francisco, signed by the interviewing officer, stating that the officer was unable to accept his application for immigration to Canada. This letter set out the requirements for the occupation of Commercial Traveller, stating that "Commercial Travellers normally require a minimum of twelve years of general education, some product and plant experience followed by extensive on the job training for a period of six months to two years; some previous sales experience, although most establishments provide extensive sales oriented training". The visa officer states in the letter that:
"because of your lack of product and plant experience and training I must conclude that you are not qualified to follow the occupation of commercial traveller in Canada and I therefore will be unable to assess your application in that category."
The officer concludes:
"You did not claim and there does not appear to be any other occupation open to immigration in which you might qualify. You were therefore assessed as a managing supervisor, retail store (CCDO 5130-114), which is the occupation which seems most closely reflect your present occupation. This assessment did not yield the minimum 70 units of assessment required under Regulation 9(1)(b). You also failed to meet the requirements of Regulation 11(2)(a) because you were awarded 0 units of occupational demand."
