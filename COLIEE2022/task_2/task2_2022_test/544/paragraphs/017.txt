If it can be inferred that a person carrying out the occupation of Managing Supervisor, Retail Store who manages a wholesale business has experience as Sales Representative, Commercial and Industrial Equipment and Supplies, the applicant is entitled to an assessment in this regard. Notwithstanding the lengthy correspondence which has taken place between the visa officer and the applicant's solicitor, such an assessment has yet to be made. The visa officer has to date failed to evaluate the applicant's work experience in the category of 5133-126, as the applicant originally equested.
