Subsection 66(4) of the plan provides that:
"Where the Minister is satisfied that, as a result of erroneous advice or administrative error in the adminstration of this act, any person has been denied, (a) a benefit or portion thereof to which the pension would have been entitled under this act, (b) a division of unadjusted pensionable earnings under section 55 or 55.1 or, (c) an assignment of a retirement pension under 65.1, the Minister shall take such remedial action as the Minister considers appropriate to place the person in the position that the person would be in under this act had the erroneous advice not been given or the administrative error not been made."
