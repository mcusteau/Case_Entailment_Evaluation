[21]
The Minister has no discretion in exercising his authority under this provision - in this regard, I refer to cases such as the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the Minister of Health and Human Resources Development v. Wiemer, [1998] FCJ 809 - unless one can bring one's self within one of the enumerated exceptions, none of which apply here.
