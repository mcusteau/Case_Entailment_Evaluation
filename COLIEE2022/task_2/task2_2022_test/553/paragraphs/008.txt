It is useful to review some of the established principles regarding H & C applications. The decision of the ministerial delegate with respect to an H & C application is a discretionary one:
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; 243 N.R. 22 (
Baker
). The standard of review applicable to such decisions is that of reasonableness simpliciter:
Baker
. The onus, on an application for an H & C exemption, is on the applicant:
Owusu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 139; 228 F.T.R. 19; 2003 FCT 94 (T.D.), per Gibson, J., citing
Prasad v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 34 Imm. L.R.(2d) 91 (F.C.T.D.), and
Patel v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 24; 36 Imm. L.R.(2d) 175 (T.D.). The weighing of relevant factors is not the function of a court reviewing the exercise of ministerial discretion:
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; 281 N.R. 1; 208 D.L.R.(4th) 1 (
Suresh
);
Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 4 F.C. 358; 288 N.R. 174 (F.C.A.) (
Legault
). The ministerial guidelines are not law and the Minister and her agents are not bound by them, but they are accessible to the public and the Supreme Court has qualified them as being of great assistance to the court:
Legault
. An H & C decision must be supported by reasons:
Baker
. It is inappropriate to require administrative officers to give as detailed reasons for their decisions as may be expected of an administrative tribunal that renders its decisions after an adjudicative hearing:
Ozdemir v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2001), 282 N.R. 394 (F.C.A.).
