MacKay, J.
: The plaintiffs (the "Ermineskin plaintiffs") apply for an order, pursuant to rule 456(4) of the
Federal Court Rules
, that the defendants (the "Crown") produce Mr. Edward E. Moore as the deponent on behalf of the Crown for purposes of examination for discovery by the plaintiffs. The order sought would direct that Mr. Moore be the deponent, in anticipation that another person will be the nominee of the Crown as its deponent, at a stage when discovery by the plaintiffs has not yet began.
