[18]
On appeal, in dealing with this issue, Chief Justice Isaac, speaking for the court of Appeal (1995), 185 N.R. 88, said (at para. 4):
"... The Motions Judge pointed out, correctly in my respectful view, that by virtue of subrule 456(2), the right to designate the person or persons to be examined for discovery on behalf of the respondent corporation is given to the respondent in the first instance and not to the appellants or to the court. Until the respondent's designates had demonstrated during the examination for discovery that they were not informed persons within the meaning of subrule 456(2), the appellants could not invoke to their benefit the provisions of subrule 456(4). ..."
The provisions of rule 456 relating to naming a deponent of the Crown for purposes of discovery parallel those for naming a deponent for a corporate party to be examined in discovery, i.e., paras. (3) and (2) respectively. The authority of the court to intervene and name a deponent under para. (4) would appear to be similar in both cases.
