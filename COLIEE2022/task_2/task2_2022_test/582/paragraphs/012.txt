In reliance on
CAE Industries Ltd. et al. v. Canada
, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 566; 13 N.R. 624, and
Chhabra v. Canada
, [1986] F.C.J. 338 (T.D.), the defendants submit that as Mr. Moore has not been an officer, servant or employee of the Crown since 1981, he cannot be nominated by the court to be examined for discovery as a representative of the defendants. Both cases concerned the application of former rule 465(1)(c) which provided for examination for discovery of the Crown, as a party, "by questioning any departmental or other officer of the Crown nominated by the Attorney General of Canada ... or by order of the court". In
CAE Industries
the Supreme Court held that rule did not permit the court to name a former Minister of the Crown, who had left office, even though when he was in office he might be considered to be the best informed "officer of the Crown", since he was not at the time of discovery "a departmental or other officer of the Crown". In
Chhabra
Mr. Justice Collier simply dismissed a motion by the plaintiff who sought an order directed to persons who were not "officers of the Crown", and had no employment or other relationship to the Crown, to be examined for discovery on behalf of the Crown.
