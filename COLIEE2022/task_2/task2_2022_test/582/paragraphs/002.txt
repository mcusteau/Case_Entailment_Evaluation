The circumstances are somewhat unusual. The action by plaintiffs in which this application is made is one ordered to be tried with two others:
Buffalo et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen et al.
(T-2022-89) (involving the "Samson plaintiffs"), and
Chief Jerome Morin et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen
(T-1386-90) (involving the "Enoch plaintiffs"). The three actions involve similar claims and issues and are to be tried on similar evidence concerning alleged breach of trust or other fiduciary obligations by the Crown in the management of oil and gas resources in Reserve lands, in the management of moneys received as royalties from sale of those resources, and in the provision of programs and services for the three Indian bands involved.
