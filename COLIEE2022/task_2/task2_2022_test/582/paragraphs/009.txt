I note that the plaintiffs do not say that Mr. Eickmeier is not a competent deponent. They do urge that he is not as well informed as Mr. Moore and that examination for discovery would be greatly facilitated if Mr. Moore were named as the deponent for the Crown. Unless that is done, it is urged that discoveries will be less effective and efficient than they could be. Moreover, it is said the plaintiffs are hindered in obtaining admissions or information which will advance their case and simplify its presentation to the court, for Mr. Moore, by his association with these issues over more than 25 years has an appreciation of fundamental issues and the continuity of events that are significant in this case, whereas Mr. Eickmeier has no similar extensive experience that would provide a comparable understanding. Finally, the plaintiffs submit they will be prejudiced if Mr. Moore is not examined with respect to events with which he has been involved over more than 25 years, while there would appear to be no prejudice to the Crown if he were directed to be its deponent.
