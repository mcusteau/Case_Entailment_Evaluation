It seems to me that the change in the rules in 1990 does change implicitly the role of the court in naming a deponent to represent the Crown in examination for discovery. That change puts the court in a secondary role, to be invoked when a deponent nominated by the Crown proves to be uniformed and incapable of being informed. This implies a greater recognition, than may have been the case under the former rule, of the role of the deponent in an examination for discovery of the Crown, or a corporation, in binding the Crown or the corporation, as the party the deponent represents, by his or her admissions of fact. That aspect of the deponent's role necessarily implies that he or she be a person in whom the Crown has reasonable confidence as its representative with implicit authority to bind the Crown.
