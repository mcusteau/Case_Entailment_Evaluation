Though the Crown did not submit evidence by affidavit in response to the Ermineskin plaintiffs' application, it is submitted in argument that Mr. Moore, at his age, is not willing to act as the Crown's deponent. Because of the scope of matters in issue between the parties, and with numerous government departments involved over the 50 years or more that are embraced in the plaintiffs' claims, whoever is the deponent for the Crown must undertake to inform himself as well as he can and to give undertakings for written responses to proper questions asked but not answered in discovery. That involvement Mr. Moore is said to be unwilling to undertake. Mr. Eickmeier, in the Crown's judgment, is competent to be its deponent and he is willing to make the commitment required, as he has done since January 1994. Moreover, insofar as Mr. Moore's direct involvement with management of Indian oil and gas resources was more extended than Mr. Eickmeier, the Crown urges that discovery is to determine facts, not the perceptions or undertakings of the deponent, and thus even for Mr. Moore his involvement in assisting with responses to undertakings requires that he review past records and refresh his memory about factual matters. Finally, while his direct experience does span a more substantial portion of the time in issue than does that of Mr. Eickmeier, even Mr. Moore's experience, with direct responsibilities, spans only 15 of some 50 years.
