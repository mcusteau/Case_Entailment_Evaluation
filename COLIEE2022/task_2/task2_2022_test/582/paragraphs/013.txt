The change to the rules in 1990 now provides, by rule 456(3), where the Crown is to be examined for discovery, the Attorney General of Canada or his Deputy "shall select an informed officer, servant or employee to be examined on behalf of the Crown". While the status or terms of employment of the person selected are not defined, the terms used, in my opinion, may be interpreted as intending to include all persons connected with the Crown (or the corporation) best informed of matters that may define and narrow the issues between the parties at trial. See
Canadian Indemnity Company v. British Columbia (Attorney General)
, [1974] 4 W.W.R. 752 (B.C.S.C.) and
de Jong v. Milwaukee Insurance Co.
(1965), 52 W.W.R.(N.S.) 371 (B.C.S.C.), dealing with the scope of the term "officer or servant" of a corporation in the provision for examination for discovery under then B.C. Rules, which declined to interpret the term in a restricted sense. Rather the courts in those cases held that whether the proposed deponent was sufficiently connected with the corporate party to be considered an officer or servant for purposes of the rule was a matter to be assessed in the circumstances of each case.
