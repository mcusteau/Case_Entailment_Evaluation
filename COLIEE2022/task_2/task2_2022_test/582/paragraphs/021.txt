Nevertheless, I am not prepared to grant the order sought by the Ermineskin plaintiffs. It is said that Mr. Moore is not willing to be the Crown's deponent and that, as he is no longer employed by the Crown except on a contract basis, the Crown cannot require him to be its deponent. This court would have to be persuaded there were exceptional circumstances that warranted making an order that would direct Mr. Moore to undertake the role of deponent unless it had some assurance that he was willing to do so, and further that the Crown had reasonable confidence in him as its representative with authority to bind the Crown by his admission of facts. At this stage there is no assurance of either.
