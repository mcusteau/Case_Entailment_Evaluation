The plaintiffs urge on the authority of
Irish Shipping Ltd. v. Canada
, [1974] 1 F.C. 445 (F.C.T.D.) and
Kodak Canada Ltd. v. Polaroid Corp.

Indeed it is presumed that counsel for the examining party knows best who should be examined. On this very basis, where the court was satisfied that someone more suitable than the person nominated by the Crown is in a position of sufficient responsibility to provide answers binding upon the Crown, the Associate Chief Justice ordered that a designated person, as nominated by the examining plaintiff, be named as deponent for the Crown in examination for discovery:
Smith v. Canada
, [1981] C.T.C. 476 (F.C.T.D.).
