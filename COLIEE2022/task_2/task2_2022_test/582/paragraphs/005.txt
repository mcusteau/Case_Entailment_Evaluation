Mr. Moore was a regular employee of the Crown, with senior responsibilities in the department concerned with Indian minerals in Western Canada, particularly in Alberta, from 1965 until 1981 when he retired or resigned from the public service. Since 1981 he has continued to work for the Crown from time to time on a contract basis. Now 73 years of age and apparently in good health, he is currently under contract by the Crown, engaged in preparations for trial in this matter. He is reported by Mr. Eickmeier to be working from an office in the litigation support element of the Crown's operations.
