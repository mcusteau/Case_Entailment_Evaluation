While I dismiss the application of the Ermineskin plaintiffs at this stage, I do not do so on the ground that it is premature. That issue was not argued before me and in argument it was assumed the Crown will name Mr. Eickmeier as its deponent to be examined in any discovery carried on by Ermineskin plaintiffs. Mr. Eickmeier's role in a similar capacity in the examination in the examination for discovery as the deponent of the Crown for questions asked by Samson plaintiffs in a related action has already provided a basis for Ermineskin plaintiffs to judge whether he is an informed person, a requirement of any nominee of the Crown under para. (3) of rule 456. The essence of the plaintiffs' case in this motion is that Mr. Eickmeier is not as well informed as Mr. Moore. I do not believe that provides a ground for this court's intervention under rule 465(4). If at a later stage the plaintiffs' experience with Mr. Eickmeier leads to a more negative assessment and that he is indeed uninformed, the plaintiffs would not be barred from advancing another motion inviting the court to order that someone other than the person nominated by the Crown, who is prepared to serve and whose experience or responsibility qualify service to be the deponent of the Crown in examination for discovery.
