The Court's Rules relating to examination for discovery, particularly of the Crown, were most recently revised by Amending Order No. 13, SOR/90 - 846, s. 15, effective December 7, 1990. The relevant provisions of rule 456 which became effective in 1990 are here set out, with their antecedents in rule 465 as it applied previously. The former provision is of interest in considering jurisprudence referred to by counsel in argument.
