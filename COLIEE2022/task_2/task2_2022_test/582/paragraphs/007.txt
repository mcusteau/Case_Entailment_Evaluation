The plaintiffs herein note that the Crown's list of documents disclosed to date includes approximately 3,600 documents to or from Mr. Moore over the years from 1965 until mid-February 1990. There are only approximately 375 documents to or from Mr. Eickmeier on that list, from 1987 on. In the discovery of Mr. Eickmeier by Samson plaintiffs to date there have been in excess of 2,500 undertakings by him to inform himself. Many responses to these undertakings completed thus far are expressly based on information from Mr. Moore, and Mr. Eickmeier has acknowledged that Mr. Moore, with whom he has spent substantial time, is the person who has been of most assistance in obtaining information, and answering undertakings, in regard to the period 1965 - 1981. In my view, the more extensive involvement of Mr. Moore which gives rise to consultation with him is not surprising given the comparative lengths of service of the two men who at different times had responsibilities in regard to management of Indian oil and gas resources, including those of the plaintiff bands.
