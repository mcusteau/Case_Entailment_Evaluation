It does appear that the visa officer placed heavy emphasis on the applicant's experience or lack thereof as a self-employed acupuncturist. The applicant relies on cases such as
Yang v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1989), 27 F.T.R. 74; 8 Imm. L.R.(2d) 48; 36 Admin. L.R. 235 (T.D.), affd. (1990) 111 N.R. 148 (F.C.A.), and
Grube v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 118 F.T.R. 163; 34 Imm. L.R.(2d) 219 (T.D.), which appear to stand for the proposition that a visa officer commits a reviewable error if undue emphasis is placed on the issue of past experience. The headnote in
Yang
states:
"The visa officer in this case interpreted the regulations in such a narrow fashion as to render qualification virtually impossible and, as a result, treated the applicant unfairly. A proper analysis requires consideration of three questions: is the applicant an accomplished musician?; can he teach?; and can he be self-employed as a teacher? The applicant in this case was successful on the first two questions and was partially successful on the third. Her only failure in respect of the third question was her lack of actual experience as a self-employed teacher. By placing undue emphasis on her lack of experience as a self-employed teacher, the visa officer allowed that partial failure on the third question to override success on the other two, an interpretation that made it almost impossible for the applicant to succeed."
