After the applicant's interview, counsel for the applicant submitted a further letter to the visa officer which was considered before the decision was rendered. I do not think it can be said that the applicant was denied the opportunity to make submissions to the visa officer on any issue of relevance to her application. On the evidence before her, the visa officer did not err in concluding that the applicant's intended business would not make a significant contribution to the economy or the cultural or artistic life of Canada.
