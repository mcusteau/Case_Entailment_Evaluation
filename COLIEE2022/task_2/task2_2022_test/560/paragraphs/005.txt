While a visa officer may commit a reviewable error by placing undue emphasis on past experience, cases such as
Yang
and
Grube
must be applied with care because they deal with applications for immigration based on the ability to make a significant contribution to the artistic or cultural life of Canada, qualifications expressly recognized in the definition of self-employed person in the
Regulations
. In
Yang
, the applicant was an accomplished musician. In
Grube
, the applicant was, amongst other things, a prima ballerina. In those cases the applicants wanted to teach music or coach and teach ballet in Canada. The test applicable to those cases - whether the applicant is accomplished in his or her field, whether he or she can teach, and whether he or she can be self-employed as a teacher - are not easily adaptable to other businesses or professions. Where the contribution to be made is artistic or cultural, past business experience, even in the cultural or artistic field in question may be of little importance, especially when the applicant wishes to be a self-employed teacher. However, where the contribution is to the Canadian economy and there is therefore greater emphasis on the commercial nature of the business, past business experience may be quite important.
