Whichever version of the letter is relied on, it does not demonstrate that the applicant will be establishing a business that would make a significant contribution to the Canadian economy. Either she is to be employed, she will be a freelance acupuncturist or the Rehabilitation Centre will refer some patients to her. If there is to be a business that will make a significant contribution, it is the business of the Rehabilitation Centre and not that of the applicant.
