The applicant had been an acupuncturist since 1984 and had some type of fee-sharing arrangement with hospitals and other facilities in Beijing at least since May of 1995. The visa officer apparently drew a negative inference from the fact that the applicant said she had a joint venture with the Long Xing Medical Equipment Scientific and Technical Development Company of Beijing, but had no joint venture agreement. The visa officer's expressed concern with inconsistencies and absence of documents ignored the circumstances in which the applicant was providing professional services. The applicant was a sole practitioner of acupuncture with affiliations with hospitals and/or other facilities. Her arrangements with these institutions appear to have been "loose", involving some type of fee splitting. Hers was not a commercial venture in which one would expect to see financial statements or other contractual or business documents. That there was no joint venture agreement is not surprising. The fee splitting information is relatively straight forward.
