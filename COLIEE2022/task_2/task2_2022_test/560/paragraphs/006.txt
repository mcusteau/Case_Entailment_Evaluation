In the present case, the visa officer seems to have gone to considerable lengths to understand the applicant's status, that is whether she was employed by others or was self-employed. I have serious doubt that the visa officer properly appreciated the information provided by the applicant. The visa officer seems to have concluded there were inconsistencies in the applicant's evidence respecting whether she earned a salary or was self-employed. The visa officer was unclear as to applicant's arrangements with hospitals or other institutions. Without going into detail, my review of the visa officer's affidavit reveals no inconsistencies or lack of clarity in the information.
