The reasons given by the visa office for refusing the application were, first, that the extent of the applicant's self-employment experience was not clear, second, that the enterprise of freelance acupuncture would not make a significant contribution to the economy or cultural or artistic life of Canada, and third, that with a personal net worth of only $80,000, the applicant had insufficient funds to establish a business and to settle herself and her dependants in Canada. The applicant says the visa officer erred in placing undue emphasis on the applicant's lack of self-employment experience, in not giving the applicant an opportunity to respond to concerns of the visa officer respecting the question of significant contribution, and because the visa officer was confused as to applicant's net worth.
