It is not necessary to deal at length with the alleged error by the visa officer with respect to the applicant's net worth. The visa officer's affidavit refers both to an amount apparently told to her by the applicant at her interview of about $41,000 and the sum of $80,000 subsequently provided by counsel. Suffice it to say, her decision refers to $80,000 which the applicant says is correct. I do not think the visa officer was confused about the applicant's net worth.
