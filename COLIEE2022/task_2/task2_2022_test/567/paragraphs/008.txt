The Applicant now challenges the decision and argues that the Visa Officer breached the rules of procedural fairness by failing to defer making a decision until he had been given the opportunity to provide the evidence concerning settlement funds. The Applicant says that the "Citizenship and Immigration Canada Manual, OP6, Federal Skilled Workers" (the "OP6 Manual") sets out the procedure to effect the implementation of section 10(1) of the Regulations. That document provides, in section 8.2, that an officer must provide an opportunity to an applicant to address any concern about sufficiency of funds if the applicant does not initially demonstrate that he has sufficient available funds.
