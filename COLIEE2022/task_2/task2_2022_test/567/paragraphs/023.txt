In my opinion, this evidence has the air of an attempt to justify his decision to ignore that issue and further suggests the importation by the Visa Officer of his personal standards for the exercise of the discretion conferred by section 76(3).

This application for judicial review will be allowed and the matter being remitted to a different visa officer for reconsideration in accordance with the law.
