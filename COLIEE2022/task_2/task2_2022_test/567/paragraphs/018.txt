The problem with this approach, in my opinion, is that it renders the OP6 Manual irrelevant. The Manual purports to assist a visa officer in assessing an application and although without the force of law, it merits some attention. In this regard, the above-cited provision of that Manual requires a visa officer to give an applicant the opportunity to supply missing documentation concerning settlement funds if they do not initially meet that criteria; Mittal (Litigation Guardian of) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 147 F.T.R. 285.
