Section 161(1) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations
(the
Regulations
) sets out a list of conditions which does not include the residency condition. The respondent submitted that these were basic conditions, to which others could be added when it was considered necessary and reasonable by the Board in each case. This power is conferred in s. 134.1(2) of the
Act
, which is broad enough to allow the NPB to impose any condition it considers reasonable and necessary to protect society and facilitate the successful reintegration of the offender into the community. I think he is right. It is clear Parliament intended to leave the NPB with broad discretion in s. 134.1(2), which reads as follows:
"134.1(2) The Board may establish conditions for the long-term supervision of the offender that it considers reasonable and necessary in order to protect society and to facilitate the successful reintegration into society of the offender."
