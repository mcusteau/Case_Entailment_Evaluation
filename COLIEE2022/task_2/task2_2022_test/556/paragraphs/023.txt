The applicant states in his affidavit that although he used the words "a more permanent visa" or "a visa for a more permanent residence", he did not intend to immigrate to Canada and Ms. Solis or the visa officer should have advised him of their concern. Curiously, the applicant's Memorandum of Argument indicates that at the interview he insisted that he would not immigrate to Canada (at paragraph 8) which indicates that he had addressed that concern to Ms. Solis. However, it appears from Ms. Solis' Statutory Declaration that the applicant did discuss his interest in remaining in Canada. The applicant also states in his affidavit that he "convey[ed] to the Visa Officer that [he] was seeking the visa (employment authorization) for which [he] had applied and no other visa." Therefore, I am satisfied that the present applicant had an opportunity to state his position and cannot seek review merely because he disagrees with the conclusion. The duty of fairness does not require the visa officer to give the applicant a second chance to expand on his earlier statement (
