On this point, Muldoon, J., noted in
Asghar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] F.C.J. No. 1091; F.T.R. Uned. 450 (T.D.), that:
"[i]t is still not clear in what circumstances procedural fairness requires that the visa officer apprise the applicant of his concerns. [...] [O]ne may conclude that this duty does not arise merely because the visa officer has not been convinced, after weighing the evidence, that the application is well-founded."
