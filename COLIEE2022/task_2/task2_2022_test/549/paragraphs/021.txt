It is my opinion that the Board did not err on this question, and that people returning to Haiti after a stay abroad do not constitute a particular social group within the meaning of section 96 of the Act.
Did the Board err by determining that the applicant did not face a particularized risk under section 97, and is therefore not a person in need of protection?
