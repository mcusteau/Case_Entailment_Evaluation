I will therefore proceed to the respondent's second argument. After having read the transcript thoroughly, I conclude that there is no reasonable apprehension of bias in the present case. Without having the audio transcript, it is difficult for me to say if the comments of the Board member were unprofessional or inappropriate. Therefore, I am not convinced that they would indicate that he was unable of deciding the issue fairly. It is always an obligation by the Board to evaluate each case on its own merits, and avoid making comments that could so much as be perceived as biased.
