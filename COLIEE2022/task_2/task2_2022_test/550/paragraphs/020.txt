I am not prepared, however, to strike out paragraphs 16 and 22 of the Amended Statement of Defence. At the hearing of this motion, counsel for the defendants argued that the alleged infringement terminated before this action and that his clients' main defense was that pursuant to s. 35 of the
Copyright Act
, no damages should be awarded if, at the time of the infringement, there was no certificate of registration. In light of these arguments, I am satisfied that paragraphs 16 and 23 of the Amended Statement of Defence contain sufficient factual grounds to raise a possible defence to counter the plaintiff's claim.
