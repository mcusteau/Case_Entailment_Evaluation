In this case, the impugned paragraphs or portion thereof of the Amended Statement of Defence are the following:
"6. They deny paragraph 11 of the Statement of Claim as unfounded in fact and in law;
"7. defendants further state that nothing in the Statement of Claim shows that the plaintiff is the true owner of each work purported to be covered by said schedules and as such defendants deny that the plaintiff is the true owner of the works alleged therein and puts the plaintiff to full proof of such ownership;
"8. They deny paragraphs 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18 of the Statement of Claim as unfounded in fact and in law. [with respect to par. 14 and 15]
"
16.
The plaintiff has failed to prove its proprietary rights in the copyright works it has alleged in this action since it first wrote to Burke Water Systems Industries Ltd. in this matter on July 13, 1994, despite several requests to this effect by the defendants' attorneys and has further failed to clarified its title in said works in the Statement of Claim;
More specifically, defendants' attorneys wrote to plaintiff's attorneys in the United States and requested such proof or referred to its absence on four occasions on July 27th, August 1st, October 28th, and November 9th, 1994. Plaintiff never responded to these requests. It appears, therefore, that the plaintiff has simply obtained a copyright registration for the purposes of instituting the present action but did not do so during settlement negotiations

It is apparent therefore that the plaintiff's action herein is abusive and has been calculated to place pressure on a competitor. In fact, when plaintiff first communicated with the defendants in this matter in July 1994, its recriminations exceeded that of simple copyright infringement. In effect, the plaintiff's default letter alleged that the defendant Burke Water Systems Industries Ltd. also infringed a Canadian patent it alleged ownership of an infringement of trade dress in the actual pumps;
As discussed in paragraph 16 above, during settlement negotiations the plaintiff never provided a cretificate (sic) of copyright and even once it did obtain such certificate in January of 1995, it did not bother to bring this fct (sic) to the attention of the defendants before instituting the present proceedings, further demonstrating plaintiff's desire to litigate above all with respect to a matter of extremely limited proportions
;
"23. Said allegations were obviously frivolous at the time and the plaintiff has now watered down its claim to a question of defendant's packaging and plaintiff's alleged copyright works."
