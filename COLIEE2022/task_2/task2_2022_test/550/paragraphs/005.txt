By Statement of Defence dated March 3, 1995, the defendants disputed the plaintiff's ownership of the copyright. By letter dated March 24, 1995, counsel for the plaintiff advised solicitors for the defendants that his client objected to those allegations which contested his ownership in the copyrights, and invited the defendants to delete, by amendment, the paragraphs at issue in order to avoid the necessity of a formal motion to strike.
