Therefore, on a motion to strike a statement of defence or portions thereof under this rule, the court must decide, assuming the facts to be true, if a reasonable defence has been raised. If there is any doubt as to whether the allegations in the Statement of Defence, or portions thereof, can succeed to counter the claim as framed, these allegations should not be struck so that the evidence may be brought before the trial judge.
