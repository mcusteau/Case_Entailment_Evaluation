The applicant submits that he was not informed of the concerns of the visa officer or Ms. Solis. He submits that he could have demonstrated his substantial ties to Pakistan. The applicant further submits that although he wanted to bring his family with him to Canada, he did not intend to immigrate to Canada. He argues that he is very close to his immediate family and merely wanted them with him during that time. The applicant also argues that although he used phrases such as "a more permanent visa" or "a visa for a more permanent residence", his intention was not to immigrate to Canada. The applicant submits that this was a denial of procedural fairness to not make him aware of these concerns. The applicant also argues that Ms. Solis relied on information obtained from the applicant's brother but she never brought this information to the applicant's attention.
