The respondent submits that the visa officer did not use any extrinsic evidence of which the applicant was not informed. The respondent also cites the decision in
Shah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 170 N.R. 238; 29 Imm. L.R.(2d) 82 (F.C.A), where Hugessen, J.A., stated that the officer does not have to put any tentative conclusions or apparent contradictions before the applicant. Although
Shah
, supra, dealt with an immigration officer exercising discretion on humanitarian and compassionate grounds under s. 9(1) of the
Immigration Act
(hereinafter
Act
), the respondent submits that this principle applies to discretionary decisions of visa officers as well (see
Covrig v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1995), 104 F.T.R. 41 (T.D.)).
