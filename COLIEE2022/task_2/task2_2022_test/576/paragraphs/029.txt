The third ground for review is that the visa officer erred in fact in finding that the applicant did not intend to enter Canada for a temporary period. As I noted above, the applicant's affidavit contains a statement to the effect that although he used the words "a more permanent visa" or "a visa for a more permanent residence", he did not intend to immigrate to Canada. Ms. Solis' Statutory Declaration states that the applicant did discuss his interest in remaining in Canada. The applicant also states in his affidavit that he "convey[ed] to the Visa Officer that [he] was seeking the visa (employment authorization) for which [he] had applied and no other visa." The applicant argues that this means that he would not stay in Canada for more than the three years under the employment authorization.
