Counsel for the applicant contacted Delisle and indicated that he would advise his client not to attend an immigration interview unless he also attended; this request was initially denied. On September 22, 1993, counsel for the applicant advised he had instructions to set up an immigration interview with the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong and to have a member of his law firm present at any immigration interviews set up in respect of the application. This request was accepted by Delisle on September 29 and it was decided that counsel could set up an interview once the applicant returned from a trip to Britain. No appointment for an immigration hearing was ever set up by the applicant's counsel and no contact was made with the Commission prior to Delisle issuing the decision in question.
