Given that both the applicant and the respondent had to deal with affiants in Hong Kong, the court has been lenient with extensions of time and with motions under Federal Court Rule 324. An order, signed by the Associate Chief Justice, fixed October 25, 1995 as the date of hearing. On October 11, 1995, however, the court and the respondent were served a "Notice of Constitutional Question". The respondent indicated several difficulties and concluded it would be impossible to proceed on the date set for hearing. It was mutually agreed to reschedule the hearing to April 1, 1996.
