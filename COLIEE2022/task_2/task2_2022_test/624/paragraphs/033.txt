Having found that the visa officer did not act in a procedurally unfair manner, I will review the merits of his decision. As a preliminary matter, I note that the applicant urged this court that, if I disagreed with the decision, I could substitute my discretion for that of the visa officer. In my view, this interpretation of the court's power on judicial review is patently wrong. In
Vidal and Dadwah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 41 F.T.R. 118 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Strayer stated at p. 122:
"The court should not interfere with the exercise of discretion by an officer or body authorized by statute to exercise that discretion unless it is clear that the discretion has been exercised in bad faith or on grounds unrelated to the purposes for which the discretion is granted."
This reasoning was also followed by Mr. Justice Collier in
Dick v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1992), 52 F.T.R. 318 (T.D.), at p. 319:
"The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the court there was a reversible error, warranting judicial interference by way of relief in the nature of certiorari. This is not an appeal, or a retrial of the matter. Nor can the court, in the absence of error in the legal sense, substitute its opinion for the discretion exercised by the immigration officer in coming to the decision he did."
So long as the visa officer properly exercised the discretion conferred upon him by the
Immigration Act
, there is no scope for substituting my opinion for that of the visa officer, regardless of whether I would have arrived at the same decision.
