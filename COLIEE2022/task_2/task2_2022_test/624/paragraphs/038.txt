My conclusions in this application are summarized as follows:
(1) Section 82.1(10) of the
Immigration Act
does not infringe s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
;
(2) the visa officer was not "functus officio" and had jurisdiction to revoke the applicant's visa;
(3) there was no breach of the applicant's right to procedural fairness; and
(4) the visa officer did not fetter his discretion and had adequate grounds upon which to base his decision.
