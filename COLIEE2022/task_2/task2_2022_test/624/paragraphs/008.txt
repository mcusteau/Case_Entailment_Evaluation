On October 13, 1993, Delisle notified the applicant that: (1) there were reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is a person described in s. 19(1)(c.2); (2) the applicant's application for a visa was refused; and (3) the applicant must return the immigrant visas issued previously to her. It is this decision -- to revoke the visas and deny the applicant admission to Canada on the basis of s. 19(1)(c.2) -- that is the subject of this judicial review.
