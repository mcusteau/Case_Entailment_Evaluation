[15]
The applicant and the respondent raised a number of issues, some of which I do not consider relevant in disposing of this application. I have decided to address the relevant issues in the following order:
(1) Does s. 82.1(10) of the
Immigration Act
infringe s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
or s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
? If so, is the infringement demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, pursuant to s. 1 of the
Charter
?
(2) Was the visa officer, in revoking the visas for the applicant, "functus officio"?
(3) Does s. 82.1(10) breach the applicant's right to procedural fairness?
(4) Did the visa officer improperly fetter his discretion or otherwise err in law?
