While the plaintiff's statement of claim relies principally on the infringement of its right to the exclusive use of "Uni Eco-Stone" as a trademark, it also seeks to expand the area of protection to which Vaon Langsdorff is entitled by claiming that the mark is one of a family of marks owned by the plaintiff that include the prefix "Eco", such as "Ecolock" and "Eco-Stone", which are also used in connection with paving stones. If this claim were substantiated, it would undoubtÂ­edly strengthen the plaintiff's allegation that any use of a mark in connection with paving stones that includes the term "Eco", such as "SF-Eco", infringes its rights.
