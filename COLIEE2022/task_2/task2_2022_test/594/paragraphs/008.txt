Although "Uni Eco-Stone" was registered in Canada by the plaintiff as the trademark for its paving stones in 1992, sales here have been modest; less than 300,000 square feet in all, or 1 million stones. This figure is put in perspective by a photograph in a newslet­ter published by S.F. Kooperation GmbH of a parking lot in Germany measuring 450,000 square feet that was paved with "SF-Eco" paving stones. As a result of the cease and desist letter from the plaintiff's solicitors, and the plaintiff's institution of proceedings for trademark infringement, there are to date no Canadian sales of SF-ECO stones.
