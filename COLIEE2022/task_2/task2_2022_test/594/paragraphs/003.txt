In this motion S.F. Concrete seeks a summary judgment under rule 216 of the
Federal Court Rules, 1998
, SOR/98-106 dismissing Von Langsdorff's statement of claim on the ground that "there is no genuine issue for trial with respect to" the plaintiff's statement of claim. The plaintiff's response to the motion is that this is not an appropriÂ­ate matter for summary judgment because there are important issues of fact that cannot be decided fairly on the basis of the evidence adduced for this motion.
