[44]
The defendant's contention is that, in comparing the allegedly infringing mark with that allegedly infringed, the first part of the name is the most important:
Conde Nast Publications Ltd. v. Union des Ã©ditions modernes
(1979), 46 C.P.R.(2d) 183 (F.C.T.D.). That is, confusion is more likely to be caused when a defendant's mark has the same first syllable as the plaintiff's. This is not the case here, of course. And apart from the term "Eco", the other part of the trademarks are not at all similar.
