Second, the defendant submitted that the prefix or term "eco" is not inherently distinctive because it is widely used in both popular and technical contexts to mean pertaining to ecology or to the natural environment, and often in a beneficial sense. To establish this the defendant produced dictionaries and other literature, to which I need not refer. It is worth noting, however, that some of the promotional literature clearly links "Uni Eco-Stone" with the cologically desirable feature that they allow water to drain into the soil, rather than running off into sewers.

Via Rail Inc. v. Location Via Route Inc.
(1992), 45 C.P.R.(3d) 199 (Qu√©. C.A.).
