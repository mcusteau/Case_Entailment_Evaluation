In July 1999 three investigators from the Procurator's Office began checking the accounting records at CFERT and interrogated the applicant regarding anomalies in two term deposits. The applicant was told by another staff member to be careful because he felt the Procurator's Officer was trying to frame the applicant. On July 28, 1999 the applicant overheard her immediate superior plotting to frame her and fled, going first to Shen Zhen and then Hong Kong. She decided to travel to Thailand, as she had obtained a visitor's visa for Thailand on June 25, 1999 with the intention of visiting a relative there. Before leaving Hong Kong on August 2, 1999, the applicant obtained a visitor's visa for Venezuela. She also applied for a Canadian visitor's visa and an interview at the Canadian Consulate was scheduled for the afternoon of August 2. The applicant did not attend the interview and instead withdrew her application. Materials submitted by the Canadian visa office in Hong Kong show the applicant "withdrew case today as she would to fly to Thailand today at 4:30 p.m."
