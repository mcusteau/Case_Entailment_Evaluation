Finally, this approach is not at odds with
Brzezinski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] 4 F.C. 525 (T.D.), as alleged by the applicant. In
Brzezinski
, Lufty, J. (as he then was), held Article 1F(b) does not include the minor crimes of shoplifting or "theft under". Lufty, J., did not base his decision on the principle that purely economic offences are excluded from Article 1F(b); rather, he found the offences were not serious because they were summary conviction offences in Canada, involved inexpensive goods and were not extraditable by treaty. The case at bar stands in stark contrast to the situation in
Brzezinski
.
