In
Malouf
, the Federal Court of Appeal considered the following certified question:
"3. Where the Convention Refugee Determination Division is considering exclusion under Article 1F(b) of the
Convention
, is it required to consider the well-foundedness of the Convention refugee claimants' claim and then, if it is determined to be well-founded, to balance the seriousness of the nonpolitical crime considered to have been committed by the claimant against the persecution feared by the claimant?"
Justice Hugessen answered the question as follows:
"Paragraph (b) of Article 1F of the
Convention
should receive no different treatment than paragraphs (a) and (c) thereof: none of them requires the Board to balance the seriousness of the applicant's conduct against the alleged fear of persecution. In
Gil v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 174 N.R. 292; 25 Imm. L.R.(2d) 209 (F.C.A.), we examined the issue with particular reference to paragraph 1F(b) and determined that a proportionality test was only appropriate for the purposes of determining whether or not a serious crime should be viewed as political. That question does not arise in this case. We are not persuaded that our decision in
Gil
was wrong."
