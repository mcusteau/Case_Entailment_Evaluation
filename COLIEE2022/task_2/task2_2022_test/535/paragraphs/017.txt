[17]
The applicant, at the hearing, relies upon the following issues in this application before the Court:
1. Is the Refugee Division's finding that the applicant is not credible patently unreasonable?
2. Did the Refugee Division err in law by relying upon the INTERPOL warrant and the letter from the Chinese Government to the Canadian Government describing the applicant's alleged crime as sufficient evidence that the applicant committed a "serious crime"?
3. Did the Refugee Division err in law by considering an "economic crime", not including any violence, to be a "serious non-political crime" for the purpose of Article 1F(b) of the
Convention
?
4. Did the Refugee Division err in excluding the applicant pursuant to Article 1F(b) of the
Convention
because it did not balance the "seriousness of the crime" against the nature of the risk to the applicant if returned to China?
