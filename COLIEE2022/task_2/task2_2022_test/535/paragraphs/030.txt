Consistency between Article 1F(b) and the
Extradition Act
is important because, as Bastarache, J., writing for a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada stated in
Pushpanathan
, supra, paragraph 73, "Article 1F(b) is generally meant to prevent ordinary criminals extraditable by treaty from seeking refugee status." In
Zrig v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)
(2003), 307 N.R. 201; 2003 FCA 178, at paragraph 68, Nadon, J.A., interpreted Bastarache, J.'s, comments in
Pushpanathan
as "an indication of the nature and seriousness of crimes which may fall under the Article 1F(b) exclusion." Similar comments were made by Décary, J.A., in his concurring opinion in
Zrig
at paragraph 108:
"Article 1F(b) is not limited to cases of extradition or to crimes associated with extradition,
although for all practical purposes it can be assumed that the crimes associated with extradition are serious crimes;
" (Emphasis added.)
I note that the standard set for extraditable crimes in subsection 3(1) is lower than that discussed by Robertson, J.A., in
Chan
, as it encompasses offences with maximum penalties of less than ten years. As the offence described in paragraph 380(1)(a) of the
Criminal Code
is punishable by a maximum term of ten years, there is no need for me to deal with this distinction.
