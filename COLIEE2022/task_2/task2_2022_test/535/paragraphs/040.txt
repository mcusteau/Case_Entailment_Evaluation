The applicant advances her balancing argument on two grounds.
First
, she submits the issue needs to be revisited in light of recent jurisprudence, notably
Pushpanathan
, supra and
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; 281 N.R. 1; 2002 SCC 1. More specifically, the applicant claims the interpretation of Article 1F(b) adopted in
Gil
does not meet with the requirements of section 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
established by
Suresh
.
Second
, she claims this case can be distinguished from
Gil
and
Malouf
because neither of those cases involved a purely economic crime.
