The applicant argues the INTERPOL warrant relied upon by the Refugee Division constitutes inadequate evidence of the alleged offence. The document contains errors, notably the identification of life imprisonment as the maximum punishment. While these errors are of concern, they were raised with the panel, who reviewed the document and concluded at page 24 of its decision:
"As per the decision of [
Legault v. Canada (Secretary of State)
(1997), 42 Imm. L.R.(2d) 192 (F.C.A.)] I consider the materials put before me by the Minister's Representative credible and trustworthy evidence in the circumstances of this claim. While these materials might not be sufficient for extradition proceedings, that is not the process this panel is charged to undertake. So based on the entirety of evidence, there is [sic] 'serious reasons for considering' the claimant committed an offence."
