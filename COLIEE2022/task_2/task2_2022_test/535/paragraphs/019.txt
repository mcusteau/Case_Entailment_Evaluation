As was the case in
Harb
, three different standards of review are applicable in the case at bar:
First, the standard of patent unreasonableness will be applied to the panel's findings of fact and its credibility finding.
Second, the Refugee Division's determination that there are serious reasons for considering the applicant to have committed embezzlement required an application of the law to the facts of the case. This is a question of mixed fact and law, and will be reviewed using reasonableness simpliciter:
Sharma v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2003), 230 F.T.R. 24; 2003 FCT 289 (T.D.), at para. 12.
Third, correctness will be applied to the Refugee Division's finding that a purely economic offence can constitute a serious non-political crime because interpreting articles of the
Convention
is a determination of law:
Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982; addendum [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1222; 226 N.R. 201; 160 D.L.R.(4th) 193, at paras. 42-50. Likewise, whether the Refugee Division was required to balance the applicant's offence against the possibility that she might be tortured while incarcerated in China is a question of law and will be reviewed using correctness.
Issue No. 1: Is the Refugee Division's finding that the applicant is not credible patently unreasonable?
