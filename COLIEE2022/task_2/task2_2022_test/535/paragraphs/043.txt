[43]
The problem with the applicant's argument is that it overlooks a critical fact that distinguishes the case at bar from
Suresh
.
Suresh
was a case about removal from Canada, whereas this case is fundamentally about entry to Canada. The applicant in
Suresh
was initially recognized as a Convention refugee and it was the Minister's later decision to deport (or "refouler") him to his country of origin, Sri Lanka, that triggered the application. Unlike
Suresh
, this is not a case where the Minister is currently seeking to deport the applicant to a country where she faces a risk of torture. The Refugee Division's task was to determine whether the applicant qualified for entry into Canada as a Convention refugee or "a person in need of protection". The distinction between entry and removal is an important one because, as the Supreme Court noted at paragraph 102 of
Suresh
, the powers of a state to refuse entry are broader than its powers to deport:
"The
Refugee Convention
, and following it the
Immigration Act
, distinguish between the power of a state to refuse entry to a refugee, and its power to deport or 'refouler' the refugee once the refugee is established in the country as a Convention refugee. The powers of a state to refuse entry are broader than to deport. The broader powers to refuse entry are based inter alia on the need to prevent criminals escaping justice in their own country from entering into Canada. No doubt the natural desire of states to reject unsuitable persons who by their conduct have put themselves 'beyond the pale' also is a factor."
