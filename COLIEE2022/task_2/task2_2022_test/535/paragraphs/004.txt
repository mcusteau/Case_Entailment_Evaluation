On August 6, 1999 the applicant travelled from Thailand to Venezuela, where she contacted a friend who worked for CFERT. She was informed that her office at CFERT had been searched and a notebook of hers was seized. The applicant claims her notebook contains information about the illegal requests made by her superiors at CFERT and criticism of China's economic reforms, its trade policies and its relationship with the World Trade Organization. In her opinion, the contents of the notebook would be embarrassing to the Chinese government if it were made public. The applicant remained in Venezuela until March 2001, at which time she travelled to Canada using a false passport. She decided to leave for Canada because it was rumoured that local Chinese gangs had been instructed by the Chinese Ministry of Security to arrest her. She obtained the false passport from a smuggler and left her own passport in Venezuela. Upon her arrival in Canada, the applicant made a refugee claim. Her claim was heard by a single member panel of the Refugee Division on July 5, 2002 and August 14, 2002.
