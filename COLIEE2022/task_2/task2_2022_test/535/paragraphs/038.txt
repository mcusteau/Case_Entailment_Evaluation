The applicant acknowledges the Federal Court of Appeal rejected the need for a balancing as part of an Article 1F(b) analysis in
Gil v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1995] 1 F.C. 508; 174 N.R. 292 (F.C.A.) and
Malouf v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1995] 1 F.C. 537; 190 N.R. 230 (F.C.A.). The following passage by Hugessen, J.A., in
Gil
at paragraph 43 was the basis for the Court of Appeal's position in both cases:
"Another panel of this Court has already rejected the suggestion made by a number of authors that Article 1F(a) requires a kind of proportionality test which would weigh the persecution likely to be suffered by the refugee claimant against the gravity of his crime. [
Gonzalez v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1994] 3 F.C. 646 (C.A.), per Mahoney, J.A., at pp. 656-657.] Whether or not such a test may be appropriate for Article 1F(b) seems to me to be even more problematical. As I have already indicated, the claimant to whom the exclusion clause applies is
ex hypothesi
in danger of persecution; the crime which he has committed is by definition 'serious' and will therefore carry with it a heavy penalty which at a minimum will entail a lengthy term of imprisonment and may well include death. This country is apparently prepared to extradite criminals to face the death penalty [
Kindler v. Canada (Minister of Justice)
, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 779] and, at least for a crime of the nature of that which the appellant has admitted committing, I can see no reason why we should take any different attitude to a refugee claimant. It is not in the public interest that this country should become a safe haven for mass bombers." (Footnotes omitted.)
