The evidence before the Pension Appeals Board to support the applicant's leave to appeal application was far more substantial than that presented to the Tribunal. Mr. Kerth submitted medical reports dating from 1994 through to 1996 outlining the condition of his back and neck. These reports describe various investigations into the origin of Mr. Kerth's neck and back pain. In 1994, x-rays showed mild degenerative disc disease at C5-6 without much evidence of nerve root compression. Similarly, the x-rays of the lumbar spine show generalized demineral­ization and mild degenerative disc disease changes. The recommendation from the 1994 examination was to conduct a myelogram to investigate whether the appli­cant had a disc lesion that might require surgery. The myelograms indicated mild degenerative changes and some osteoarthritis in the cervi­cal region, but were otherwise normal with no evidence of disc protrusion.
