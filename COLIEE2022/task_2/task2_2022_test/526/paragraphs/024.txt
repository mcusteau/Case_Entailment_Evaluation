A leave to appeal proceeding is a preliminary step to a hearing on the merits. It is a first, and lower, hurdle for the applicant to meet than that that must be met on the hearing of the appeal on the merits. The applicant, at the leave stage, does not have to prove his or her case. For example, in the Federal Court of Appeal decisions to which counsel for the respondent referred me, dealing with old Federal Court Rule 1107(1), the following comments are found:
Kurniewicz v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1974), 6 N.R. 225 (F.C.A.), at p. 230:
"In order for such a motion to succeed, the applicant must satisfy the court that there is some arguable ground upon which the proposed appeal
might succeed
." (emphasis added)
Consumers' Association of Canada et al. v. Hydro Electric Power Commission of Ontario (No. 2)
(1974), 2 N.R. 479 (F.C.A.), at p. 482:
"... before this application can be granted, the court must be able to see a specific question of law or jurisdiction the answer to which
may lead
to the setting aside of the decision or order attacked." (emphasis added)
