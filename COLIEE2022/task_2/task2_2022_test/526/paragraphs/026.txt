I was informed by counsel that when leave is granted in these cases, the rehearing being a trial de novo, the applicant can bring to the Board any additional evidence that is relevant, whether it pre-dates or post-dates the Tribunal's decision, and that he is not limited to adducing only the evidence filed in support of his application for leave to appeal. In addition, an applicant may still be entitled to benefits if the evidence establishes the existence of his disability on a date later than that of the Tribunal's decision. For example, in this case, the applicant will be entitled to benefits if he can establish that his disability existed at some time prior to January 1, 1998. The Tribunal rendered its decision on June 5, 1997. I have not verified these assertions but counsel for the respondent did not take exception to them. If they are correct, they are an additional reason for adopting a lower threshold at the leave stage than exists on a hearing on the merits.
