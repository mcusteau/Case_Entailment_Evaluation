I turn then to these factors as they relate to the decision under review. The legislative parameters of the intended review are set out in s. 18.1(4) of the
Federal Court Act
. The
Plan
contains no privative clause except to say that decisions of the Pension Appeals Board are final, subject only to judicial review. While there has been some indication in the jurisprudence that s. 18.1(4)(d) of the
Federal Court Act
requires "patent unreasonability", this was not the test applied in
Pushpanathan
, or more recently in
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] S.C.J. No. 39; 243 N.R. 22. I note that the phrases in paragraph 18.1(4)(d) are disjunctive; one asks whether the decision under review was based on a finding of fact that was made in a perverse
or
capricious manner
or
without regard for the material before the decision-maker. That is, insofar as the review of decisions by reference to their underlying facts is concerned, the statutory mandate allows for a spectrum of review from one which involves a high degree of deference (perversity or capriciousness must be shown) to one in which correctness or reasonableness may be the test (the decision-maker did not exhibit regard for the material before it). When the review relates to questions of law, however, in s. 18.1(4)(c) a spectrum is not provided.
