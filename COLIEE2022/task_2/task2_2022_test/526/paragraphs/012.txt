Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the evidence included a more detailed report from Dr. Eagar, and a work assessment report, by social worker Rebecca Milo. Dr. Eagar's report dated September 22, 1997, summarizes much of Mr. Kerth's medical history and treatment over the past few years. He states that Mr. Kerth's diagnoses are chronic obstructive airway disease and osteoarthritis of the spine with multi-level involvement and narrowing at C5/6. The report also mentions Mr. Kerth's high blood pressure and a bout of bronchitis; he has been prescribed various asthma-like ventila­tors since that time. The report also states that the exercises prescribed by Dr. McDougall (in the information presented before the Tribunal) were causing pain and that Mr. Kerth had stopped doing them. Dr. Eagar concludes his report by stating:
"Back and neck pain with bad headaches frequently. He can't mow the grass, do yardwork, or housework such as vacuum­ing. For three years, he has not been able to shovel his driveways snow accumula­tion. Since the spring of 1997, his left knee has been painful. He gets cramping in his hands when driving a car or with pro­longed sitting or standing. When going upstairs, he gets short of breath and has to use his inhalers with the slightest strenuous activity. He has marked, permanent disabil­ities as outlined above and in my view, these make him unemployable in any capacity."
