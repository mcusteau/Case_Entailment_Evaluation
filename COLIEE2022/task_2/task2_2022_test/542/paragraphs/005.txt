While the Board, at one point in its decision, states that "[t]here is ... an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA), which
is possible
for both claimants in Colombo ...", this does not indicate that the Board applied an incorrect burden of proof. The Board later, stated that "[t]he claimant and her 13 year old daughter suffer a mere possibility, but not a reasonable chance of persecution in Colombo ...". This statement, in my view, counteracts the argument that the Board used an inappropriate burden of proof.
