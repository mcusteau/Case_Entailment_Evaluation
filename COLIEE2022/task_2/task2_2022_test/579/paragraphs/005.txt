The meeting with Mr. Hayman took place on 12 March 2003, and was rather technical in nature. Mr. Hayman, however, recalls informing VR Interactive that the delays to file for the first tax year had already expired, and the deadline for the second year was fast approaching. The representatives of VR Interactive who attended the meeting do not recall any discussion of deadlines.
