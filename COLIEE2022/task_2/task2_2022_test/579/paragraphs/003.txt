The facts are fairly straightforward. VR Interactive was a privately held corporation founded by a professor at the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design. In order to attract more capital, the corporation went public. Unfortunately, as sometimes happens in these matters, the founder and the new investors did not see eye to eye. There was a rather acrimonious parting of the ways. The founder left with, among other things, his knowledge of scientific research and experimental development matters and how to file claims in relation thereto under the
Income Tax Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (supp.), as amended. The new Chief Executive Officer, Francis Mackenzie, was vaguely aware that there were scientific research credits to be had, but did not know how to go about it. The tax authorities' website gave notice of an executive service which could be of assistance. VR Interactive characterizes this as a "hand-holding" service. Mr. MacKenzie called the respondent's office in Halifax and was told that the man to speak to was Mr. Hayman. Mr. MacKenzie first tried to reach Mr. Hayman in the fall of 2002, managed to reach him in January 2003 and a meeting was organized for March 2003.
