At an early stage of these proceedings, VR Interactive was given leave to be represented by one of its corporate officers, rather than by a solicitor which is the normal rule. The respondent had not objected to that application. As a result, we were treated to a primer on administrative law. Many of the points raised were interesting, but do not relate to the case at hand.
