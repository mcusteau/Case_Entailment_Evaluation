Mr. Gibson cannot be said to have failed to exercise his duty because of his reliance on the review committee. The final decision in fact and in law was his. As stated by Evans, J., in
Gerle Gold Ltd. et al. v. Golden Rule Resources Ltd. et al.
(1999), 163 F.T.R 185 (T.D.), at para. 50 (reversed in part, but not on this point (2000), 261 N.R. 356 (F.C.A.)):
"Second, in the institutional context of this decision, namely a government department, it is surely reasonable to interpret the duty of the Minister, or a delegate, to "review the matter" as impliedly authorizing the formation of a tentative view which is likely to be informed by the analysis provided by departmental officials."
