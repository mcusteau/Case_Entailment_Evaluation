It was suggested that there should have been an oral hearing because of the differences of opinion between the VR Interactive officials and Mr. Hayman as to what was said at the meeting in March 2003. I see no reason why an oral hearing should have been granted. In any event, as aforesaid, since there is no suggestion that Mr. Hayman made representations as to delays for filing, which representations were acted upon to VR Interactive's detriment, the point is simply not germane.
