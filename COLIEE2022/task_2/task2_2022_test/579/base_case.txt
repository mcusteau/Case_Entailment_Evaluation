O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision by a division of Public Works and Government Services Canada (PWGSC). The Superannuation Pension Transition and Client Services Sector of PWGSC (the Sector) conveyed its decision in a letter to the applicant dated November 1, 2004, to request recovery of an overpayment made to the applicant between 1999 and 2002.
[2]
The applicant seeks:
1. A declaration that the respondent is not entitled to recover any alleged overpayment of pension monies from the applicant's Public Service Superannuation Plan, pursuant to the
Public Service Superannuation Act
and its
Regulations
;
2. An order reimbursing the applicant for all monies wrongfully deducted from his Public Service Superannuation pension since January 2005; and
3. Costs.
Background
[3]
The applicant was an employee of PWGSC in Toronto as an engineer from 1982 until he was terminated in January 1999 for alleged just cause. He began receiving his pension benefits immediately. The applicant, however, successfully grieved his termination and in August 2002, was reinstated retroactive to the date of his termination. The retroactive reinstatement meant that he received pensionable salary for the period between January 1999 and August 2002.
[4]
On September 15, 2004, the applicant resigned from the public service. The regional human resources office immediately advised the applicant of his pension entitlements, including the effect of his re-employment. The applicant then applied to the Sector for his pension entitlements.
[5]
By two letters dated November 1, 2004, the Sector advised him of his general pension entitlement, once again highlighting the effect his re-employment had on those entitlements and of the overpayment which occurred during the period January 1999 to August 2002. The overpayment letter stated in part:
"When you became re-employed in the Public Service in August 2002, you were fully re-instated to your termination date of January 7, 1999. Therefore, this created an overpayment which must be repaid.
The amount of the overpayment is:
Basic Pension
$71,1078.01 [sic]
Supplementary Retirement Benefit
$2,437.00
Total
$73,515.01
and can be repaid by one of the following methods:
1. You can make one lump sum payment of $73,515.01 payable to the Receiver General for Canada. Send your cheque or money order to this office.
2. You can have monthly deductions of $538.71 (PSSA) for life and $47.25 (SRBA) for 57 months with a final payment of $22.26. These deductions will be effective January 2005.
If we do not hear from you within 30 days of the date of this letter, we will assume you have chosen Method 2."
[6]
The applicant did not make an election within 30 days and the Sector began monthly deductions from his pension beginning January 2005. The applicant took action with respect to the demand for repayment and challenged the validity of the alleged overpayment. In June 2005, the applicant commenced an action in this Court seeking reimbursement of the monies deducted and damages (Docket T-957-05). That action, through various procedural events, was eventually converted into the application for judicial review which is now before the Court challenging the determination of the sector that the applicant had been overpaid and the decision to seek recovery.
The Factual Dispute
[7]
The approximate date on which the applicant was made aware of the overpayment, though not necessarily dispository, is the subject of dispute. The applicant claims that he was first informed of the overpayment when he received the letter above, despite the fact that according to the Sector, the overpayment was triggered and became effective in August of 2002.
[8]
While the applicant disputes the validity of the alleged overpayment, he also alleges that PWGSC deliberately refrained from informing him of the overpayment for over two years for tactical reasons. Through requests for information, the applicant has collected various internal emails within PWGSC which indicate that the Sector and PWGSC were both aware of the overpayment and discussed when the applicant should be informed. No mention of the overpayment was found in the internal emails of the Sector, which had control over the pension and superannuation.
[9]
The respondent agrees that the overpayment was triggered in August 2002, at the time of the retroactive reinstatement. The respondent, however, highlights the separation between the Sector, which is responsible for recovering the pension overpayment, and the PWGSC's human resources department, which was responsible for most other aspects of employee compensation. The Sector had no involvement in any of the applicant's previous employment proceedings. The respondent explains that while the Sector may have been aware of the overpayment prior to November 2004, it was not obliged to recover any overpayment until the applicant began receiving his pension again.
[10]
The respondent also alleges that as early as August 2003, in a telephone conversation, the applicant was advised of the overpayment. He was advised that while he would be credited with pensionable service for the period January 1999 to August 2002, he would also be required to repay the pension benefits received during that period.
Issues
[11]
The issues are as follows:
1. What is the standard of review?
2. Was the Sector's determination that the applicant had been overpaid correct?
3. Was the Sector's decision to seek recovery made in a fair manner?
Applicant's Written Submissions
[12]
The applicant submits that the decision should be subject to the correctness standard because the decision was made by an unidentified lower level decision maker within the Sector who is not conferred any degree of discretion.
[13]
Section 6 of the
Public Service Superannuation Regulations
, SOR/93-450 (the
Regulations
) refers only to the collection of pension amounts paid "in error". The applicant submits that clearly the pension payments he received during the period January 1999 to August 2002 were not made in error, but were his absolute entitlement as a direct consequence of his age at termination. One can draw the inference that the authors of the legislation never contemplated a situation as in the present case, where an individual who had reached retirement age would be terminated for cause and subsequently reinstated.
[14]
The applicant also submits that there is no basis in the legislation for the imposition of life insurance premiums in the monthly deductions.
[15]
The applicant further argues that he was denied procedural fairness by the decision of the Sector not to disclose the overpayment to the applicant until after he had resigned from employment and released all claims against PWGSC.
Respondent's Written Submissions
[16]
The respondent agrees that the appropriate standard of review is correctness since the decision involved the application of mandatory statutory requirements, but asserts that the decision was correct. The respondent explains that the
Public Service Superannuation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-36 (the
PSSA
) and the
Regulations
expressly mandate both the entitlement to pension benefits and the recovery of pension overpayments.
[17]
Since the applicant was reinstated to the date of his termination, sections 27 and 30 of the
Regulations
deem his employment to have been without interruption during that period. Section 29 of the
PSSA
expressly prohibits anyone from receiving both pension benefits and pensionable salary for the same period by terminating any pension payments in the event of re-employment. This prohibition is also consistent with the
Income Tax Regulations
, C.R.C. c. 945, paragraph 8503(3)(b) says the respondent. Section 6 of the
Regulations
then directs the recovery of any pension amounts paid in error and authorizes the process whereby the payee can elect to repay in a lump sum or by monthly deductions.
[18]
The respondent submits that the Sector was simply required to recover the overpayment and did not treat the applicant any differently than any other employee. His reinstatement meant that his previous entitlement to a pension was in error. He was not entitled to an annuity for the period January 1999 to August 2002. He was in fact a contributor during this period.
[19]
In regards to the applicant's claim that the Sector deliberately withheld notification, the respondent says that the timing was simply the result of statutory requirements. The applicant, who was represented by counsel throughout the entire labour proceedings, is presumed to know the plain statutory requirements even though that dispute did not address pension entitlement. Pursuant to the
PSSA
, the Sector was not entitled to recover the overpayments from the applicant's annuity until that annuity became payable once again.
Analysis and Decision
[20]
Issue 1
What is the standard of review?
I agree with the parties. The standard of review for the determination of the overpayment is correctness. Since the applicant's only challenge to the validity of the overpayment is a tentatively raised argument regarding the meaning of the words "in error" in section 6 of the Regulations, the question before the Court can be characterized as a question of law, subject to the correctness standard. Regardless, we are clearly dealing with a question in which the decision maker cannot be shown deference. The decision was the result of following mandatory requirements and was simply a determination of verifiable facts and did not involve any degree of discretion.
[21]
With regard to the Sector's decision to seek recovery for the overpayment, the applicant's primary argument is that the timing and overall conduct of the Sector was procedurally unfair. As such, I would review this issue as a matter of procedural fairness. If the duty of fairness is found to have been breached, the decision will be vacated (see
Richter v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) et al.
, [2008] F.T.R. Uned. 595; [2009] 1 F.C.R. 675; 73 Imm. L.R. (3d) 131; 2008 FC 806 at paragraph 9, affd. [2009] N.R. Uned. 20; 2009 FCA 73).
[22]
Issue 2
Was the Sector's determination that the applicant had been overpaid correct?
Subsection 6(1) of the
Regulations
provides:
"6.(1) Where an amount has been paid in error under the Act to any person on account of any annuity or annual allowance, the Minister shall forthwith demand payment from that person of an amount equal to the amount paid in error."
"6.(1) Si, en vertu de la Loi, un montant a été versé par erreur à une personne en raison d'une pension ou d'une allocation annuelle, le ministre doit, immédiatement, sommer cette personne de payer un montant égal au montant qui a été payé par erreur."
[23]
The applicant's assertion is that the pension annuity payments made to him during the period January 1999 to August 2002 were not made in error, because the Sector was obliged to make those payments at the time.
[24]
Essentially, the applicant is asserting that the determination of whether payments are made in error for the purposes of section 6, can only be made with reference to the point in time when the payment was made. I do not find sufficient support for this somewhat narrow reading.
[25]
The proper approach to statutory interpretation bears repeating. As formulated by Mr. Justice Iacobucci in
Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1 at paragraph 21, who quoted as follows from Elmer Driedger,
Construction of Statutes
, 2nd ed. (Markham, Ontario: Butterworths, 1983):
"... the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament."
[26]
The applicable thrust of this oft-cited passage is that when the words of an enactment are capable of supporting multiple meanings, the meaning most consistent with the scheme or object of the enactment is the correct meaning. Therefore, I would turn to other clues within the Regulations and its enabling statute, the
PSSA
, which provide insight into the objective of section 6.
[27]
Section 5 of the
PSSA
governs required employee contributions to the superannuation account or the Public Service Pension Fund. The section is compressive and detailed but generally, persons employed full time in the public service for a period of six months or greater are contributors for the purposes of the
PSSA
.
[28]
Section 13 governs when benefits become available to contributors with two or more years of service.
[29]
Section 29 clearly implies a prohibition against receiving a pension benefit and a pensionable salary for the same period. Such a prohibition accords with common sense and a fundamental principle of pension schemes generally - periods of contribution and periods of benefit receipt are to be mutually exclusive. It would frustrate that purpose if the words of section 6 were read so narrowly as the applicant suggests.
[30]
The applicant does not dispute that for the period January 1999 to August 2002 he received pension benefits and as a result of his retroactive reinstatement, pensionable salary. In retrospect, since the applicant became re-employed immediately after his termination in January 1999, his benefits should have been terminated without delay. Thus, the payments were made in error and the Sector was correct in determining an overpayment resulted.
[31]
It does not matter that no mistake was made at the time. In this context, in error has a significantly broader meaning than by mistake. I would not allow judicial review on this ground.
[32]
Issue 3
Was the Sector's decision to seek recovery made in a fair manner?
The applicant alleges that the Sector deliberately withheld notice of the overpayment in bad faith. While it is clear that the Sector does have some degree of discretion regarding when to notify the payee and demand repayment, the Sector is also restricted by certain provisions. Indeed, the respondent asserts that the Sector simply followed these provisions (see subsection 8(9) of the
PSSA
in the Annex to this decision).
[33]
Thus, while the Crown reserves the right to any form of recourse, the Minister is only given express authorization to recover monies through deductions from subsequent payments. In the present case, the Sector notified the applicant and made the demand for repayment as soon as the applicant began receiving subsequent payments following his resignation in September 2004.
[34]
An official notification to the applicant of the overpayment and his future obligations would have been a courtesy, but I have not found any basis for the legal entitlement to such notification and I am thus not inclined to set aside the decision for the failure to give one.
[35]
I would note the overpayment was a simple operation of law that resulted from his retroactive reinstatement. Everyone is presumed to know the law and that presumption is stronger in the present case because the applicant was represented by counsel throughout his labour proceedings and continued to be represented long after the reinstatement decision (see
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED and
Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation v. Scott et al.
(2006), 295 F.T.R. 124; 46 Admin. L.R. (4th) 210; 2006 FC 721 at paragraph 24).
[36]
As well, there is some evidence that the applicant's attention was specifically drawn to the issue of overpayment. Attached to the affidavit of Karen Trites, a senior policy advisor at the Sector, was a note taken from a telephone call from the applicant and a client inquiry officer on September 3, 2003. The note indicates that the client inquiry officer informed the applicant about the benefits his re-employment would have on his pension, but also about the overpayment. The note also indicates that the applicant said he would speak to his lawyer about the overpayment. I would not allow judicial review on this ground.
[37]
At the hearing of this matter, the parties informed me that the life insurance premiums were deducted in error and that the parties would resolve that issue. Consequently, this decision and order do not encompass the claim concerning life insurance.
[38]
The application for judicial review is therefore dismissed with costs to the respondent.
JUDGMENT
[39]
IT IS ORDERED that
the application for judicial review is dismissed with costs to the respondent. This order does not encompass the claim for the return of the life insurance premiums.
Application dismissed.
