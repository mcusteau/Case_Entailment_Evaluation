According to the decision in
Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1998), 157 F.T.R. 35, judicial intervention is warranted when the Board ignores evidence that is important to the disposition of a claimant's case. In my opinion, the present application invites such judicial intervention. I cannot safely conclude that the Board considered the second affidavit of Mr. Rico-Martinez and that affidavit is important to the Applicants' claim.
