The applicant had stated that he was forcibly conscripted by the El Salvadoran Army in 1983 at the age of 13 and that he left military service five months later because he was required to work on his family's farm. He claimed that after he had left the army he was perceived as an enemy by the guerillas and that in 1983 they visited his home on five or more occasions. They never personally saw or spoke to him nor did they threaten his family. He also claimed that on January 27, 1993, during the night, five hooded bandits entered his home and demanded jewellery and money. The bandits had rounded the applicant's parents and sisters into one room but were unaware that the applicant and his brother were also in the house. He surreptitiously shot one of the bandits in the arm as they fled. Fearing the return of the bandits seeking revenge for the shooting of one bandit during that evening the claimant fled and left the country on January 29, 1993.
