The second decision is that of Mr. Justice Nadon in
Castillo v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, File no. Imm-1431-93. In a decision pronounced on April 15, 1994 Mr. Justice Nadon had to deal with a situation where the presiding member interrupted the examination of the applicant and intervened with his own questions 388 times. In that case Mr. Justice Nadon concluded that the conduct of the presiding member, as well-intentioned as it may have been, was unacceptable. He concluded that in the case at bar the effect of the interruptions by the presiding member was that the applicant did not have the right to a fair and equitable hearing in that the applicant was prevented from presenting his evidence.
