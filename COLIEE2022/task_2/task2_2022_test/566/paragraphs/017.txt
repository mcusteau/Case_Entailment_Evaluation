The Board said:
"The panel is of the opinion that there is no link between the bandits and the guerillas of the past particularly in regard to the motivation for the attack. The time lapse of nine years, in addition to the observations of a twelve-year-old as to height and voices of individuals recollected nine years later as to the identity of hooded individuals is little more than conjecture. The guerillas had never threatened the claimant or his family, or had even seen the claimant on any of their visits in 1983. The bandits had not seen him or been aware of his presence in January 1993.
"Regardless of their past as guerillas, they are now bandits. The family were victims of an attack that resulted in robbery and death of his sister by individuals involved in criminal acts. The claimant was a victim of the same criminal act. He was neither specifically targeted nor singled out. Indeed the attackers were not even aware of his presence in the house. When one of their number was shot by the claimant, in the arm, they were unaware of who had shot them. In addition, we considered that the claimant had prepared to leave the country previous to the January 1993 robbery at his home."
