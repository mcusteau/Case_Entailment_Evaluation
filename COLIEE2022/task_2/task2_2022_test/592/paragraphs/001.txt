Rothstein, J.
: The applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada in the occupation of Chef-Cook, General (CCCDO6121-111). The visa officer found the applicant did not establish that he had received any training or experience as a Chef-Cook and that he did not qualify for selection in that occupation. She then assessed the applicant as an Assistant Manager Restaurant, an occupation for which he had training. However, there was no demand in that occupational category and he received zero units of assessment for the occupational factor.
