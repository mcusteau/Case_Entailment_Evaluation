The standard of review of patent unreasonableness applies to a Board's finding with respect to Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) (Chorny v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1263 (F.C.T.D.) at para. 11). The Applicant has not demonstrated that she would face a well-founded fear of persecution should she live in Caracas. The Applicant has failed to provide evidence to substantiate her assertion that the FARC would be able to locate her anywhere in Venezuela. Even assuming the U.S. News & World Report allegations that a FARC base is located in Venezuela, it does not follow that the FARC would be able to locate the Applicant in Caracas.
