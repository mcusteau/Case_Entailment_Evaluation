The Applicant states that on May 6th, 2003 she received a call from her common-law spouse in Colombia. He told her that the FARC was looking for her. The Applicant says that two days later four men came to her mother's house while the Applicant was there. There is a factual dispute discussed below as to what occurred at this point, but both parties agree that the men left when no-one answered their knocks at the door.
