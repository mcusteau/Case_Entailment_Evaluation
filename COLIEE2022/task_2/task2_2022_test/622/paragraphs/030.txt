The credibility issues that stem from the visit by four men to the Applicant's mother's house are somewhat more complex. The Respondent argues that the two narratives regarding the incident at the Applicant's mother's house are clearly inconsistent. However, while the Applicant's two narratives of the incident are not identical, it is possible that one narrative is simply less descriptive than the other narrative. It is possible that four men arrived at the Applicant's mother's house and that while waiting for someone to open the door, the men shouted death threats and that the Applicant owed money to the FARC. It is possible that although one narrative is less vivid than the other that neither narrative contradicts the other.
