It is possible that the Board mistook the U.S. News & World Report article as being an article from The Economist. As the Board refers to The Economist as "the only evidence... that makes allusions to allegations of close contact between the present Venezuelan government and the FARC" (Board's decision, page 4), and the U.S. News & World Report article makes this allegation, such a mistake seems likely. If this is the case, then the mistake can be considered a clerical error that did not impact on the Board's reasons.
