I am satisfied, however, that on a patent unreasonableness standard, the Board's decision regarding credibility can be upheld. The fact is that in her oral testimony the Applicant did not discuss any threats, or even suggest that the men at her mother's house had said anything. Although it is possible that this was a simple omission by the Applicant, it was within the Board's power to determine that the difference in accounts is an inconsistency that goes to the credibility of the claimant.
