In this case, it is not clear as to what evidence was presented to suggest that Venezuela is incapable of protecting the Applicant from the FARC. Although the Board makes a reference to an article in The Economist, the only article found on record was in fact a U.S. News & World Report piece entitled "Terror Close to Home" (Affidavit of Dominique Toillon). The report in U.S. News & World Report, which appears to have been the only newspaper article introduced at the hearing, alleges that the FARC have established a training base in the Perij√° mountains in Venezuela. The article reports that Columbia has complained that Venezuela is supporting the FARC, but Venezuela denies the allegation. The article does not suggest that individual Venezuelans targeted by the FARC within Venezuela cannot be protected by the state. The Applicant has not presented the testimony of similarly situated individuals, or presented evidence that would reverse the presumption that Venezuela is capable of protecting the Applicant from the FARC.
