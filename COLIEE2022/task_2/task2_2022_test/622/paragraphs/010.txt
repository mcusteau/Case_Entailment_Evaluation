It should be noted that the Board's record refers to an article from The Economist (at page 4 of the Board's reasons), but that no such article appears to be included within the Tribunal's record. The only newspaper article in the file is from the U.S. News & World Report, and that it was introduced at the hearing (Affidavit of Dominique Toillon, sworn August 23rd, 2005).
