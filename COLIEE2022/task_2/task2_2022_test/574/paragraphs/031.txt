I agree with the Respondent. The visa officer did not simply accept the veracity of the untested allegations in the informant's correspondence and made no finding in respect of criminal inadmissibility. Instead, at the second interview, the officer put the substance of the allegations to the Applicant and asked him to reply. The CAIPS notes on May 21, 2005 indicate that the visa officer concluded that the Applicant's testimony was not credible on the basis of reply to questions of occupation and military service:
The applicant was confronted with the information we received that he had been involved in the smuggling of persons and gem stones and that he had been jailed. The applicant said that it was not true as he was a leather specialist. When asked to explain his work of leather specialist, the applicant provided me with very evasive answers and couldn't provide any concrete details about his occupation.
. . . . .
The applicant said that during his military service, he was in charge of a team of soldiers who were sewing uniforms and doing embroidery. When I asked the applicant to provide me with more info, he repeated the same thing....
The applicant's answers to my questions have been contradictory and evasive during the interview. I don't find credible his explanations about his military service and his occupation in Afghanistan. Application to be refused on lack of credibility.
