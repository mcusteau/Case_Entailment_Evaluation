[19]
The facts of this case are clearly distinguishable from those in John. The Applicant did not request an opportunity in which to gather evidence to address the officer's concerns. The onus was on the Applicant to request an extension of time to refute the allegations against him, and he did not do so. It cannot be said that he was denied an opportunity to produce further evidence after the hearing to address officer Drouin's concerns; he simply did not request such an opportunity. There is no evidence either in the record before the visa officer or in the affidavits before the Court to support a finding that the Applicant communicated an intention, either at the hearing or afterward, to produce evidence to refute the claims of criminality made against him.
