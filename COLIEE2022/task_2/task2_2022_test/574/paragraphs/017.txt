[17] It is the Respondent's position that the Visa Officer discharged the duty of fairness by advising the Applicant of his concerns, and providing him with an opportunity to respond to them at the hearing. The Respondent relies on Patel v. Canada (Secretary of State), [1995] F.C.J. No. 1410 (F.C.T.D.), a case in which the Court found that the duty of fairness was met when the Applicant was interviewed a second time so that he could respond to the visa officer's concerns about his lack of credentials and experience as a printing mechanic.
