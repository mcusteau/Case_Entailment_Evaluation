The Respondent objects that the Applicant seeks that this Court review the visa officer's decision on the basis of new evidence which was not before the decision maker. Specifically, it is submitted that paragraphs 3 to 10, 12, 18, and 24 of the affidavit sworn by the Applicant on October 1, 2005, adduces new facts that were not before the visa officer at the time of his decision. The same new facts are restated in portions of the supporting affidavits sworn by Khwaja Sidiqi and Zohira Vali Muhammad on October 2, 2005. The Applicant produces these affidavits as proof of his credibility with respect to his occupation and his military service, and in support of his contention that the visa officer erred in finding the Applicant inadmissible.
