I have reviewed the visa officer's decision and reasons filed with the Court on September 1, 2005, and the supplementary certified tribunal record filed on February 27, 2006. I conclude that the affidavit evidence referred to above did not form part of the record before the visa officer and, as a consequence, may not be considered by this Court reviewing his decision. For this Court to review the decision on the basis of evidence unknown to the visa officer would be to depart from its scope of review on the record to a de novo appeal on the merits. In the Applicant's affidavit, paragraphs 3 to 9 disclose particulars of family background unknown to the visa officer; paragraphs 10 and 12 relate to the Applicant's military service and responsibilities in the Logistics Unit at the military airport in Kabul, Afghanistan; paragraph 18 discloses that the Tajik government would not grant the Applicant permanent residence; and paragraph 24 describes the Applicant's residence permit to live in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. There is no material in the record to suggest that this information was known to the visa officer on or before June 14, 2005, and this Court will not consider these new facts in disposing of this case.

Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by failing to provide the Applicant with a meaningful opportunity to respond to the allegations of criminality?
