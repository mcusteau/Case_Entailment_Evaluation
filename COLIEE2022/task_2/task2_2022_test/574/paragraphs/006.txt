On April 13, 2005, the visa officer received a telephone call from an identifiable third party (informant) who stated that the Applicant was a former drug trafficker, had been imprisoned in Dushanbe, had been a Khalqi member of the PDPA, and had been involved in combat while serving in the military in Afghanistan. The visa officer told the informant to send the information to the Canadian Embassy in writing. On April 19, 2005, the informant faxed to the Embassy a letter alleging that the Applicant was an active member of the Hizbi Halq, that he had served in the Khad, that he had smuggled gold and precious stones in the preceding five to six years, that he had trafficked people from Afghanistan abroad, and that he had been imprisoned twice for people-trafficking and smuggling stones.
