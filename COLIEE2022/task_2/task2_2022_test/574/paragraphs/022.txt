Neither party addressed the standard against which to review the decision of a visa officer to grant or deny an application for permanent residence, or against which to review an officer's cumulative finding of adverse credibility. In Ouafae v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 459, Justice Yves de Montigny reviewed and noted that the Court was divided on whether standard of reasonableness simpliciter or patent unreasonableness applied to decisions of visa officers. After considering the pragmatic and functional analysis conducted by Justice John O'Keefe in Yin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2001), 106 A.C.W.S. (3d) 726 (F.C.T.D.), Justice de Montigny concluded that decisions of visa officers based on purely factual assessments are reviewable on a patently unreasonable standard, whereas decisions of visa officers based on application of the facts to legal standards are reviewable on a reasonableness standard. At paragraphs 18 to 20 and 22, Justice de Montigny held:
[18] Opinion on the appropriate standard of review for decisions by visa officers is divided and appears to have spawned seemingly contradictory decisions. In some cases, reasonableness simpliciter was the chosen standard (see, inter alia, Yaghoubian v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] FCT 615; Zheng v. Canada (M.C.I), IMM-3809-98; Lu v. Canada (M.C.I.), IMM-414-99). In other decisions, patent unreasonableness was chosen instead (see, for example, Khouta v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] FC 893; Kalia v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2002] FCT 731).
[19] And yet, on closer inspection, these decisions are not irreconcilable. The reason for the different choices is essentially that the nature of the decision under review by this Court depends on the context. Thus it goes without saying that the appropriate standard of review for a discretionary decision by a visa officer assessing a prospective immigrant's occupational experience is patent unreasonableness. Where the visa officer's decision is based on an assessment of the facts, this Court will not intervene unless it can be shown that the decision is based on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner.
[20] However, it is not the same for a decision by a visa officer involving an application of general principles under an Act or Regulations to specific circumstances. Where the decision is based on a question of mixed law and fact, the Court will show less deference and seek to ensure that the decision is quite simply reasonable. That is what my colleague O'Keefe, J., held after using the pragmatic and functional approach in Yin v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2001] FCT 661...
. . . . .
[22] ...[T] his Court must show deference when the impugned decision is purely factual. That is not the case here: on the contrary, this is a question of mixed law and fact, which calls for a lower level of deference than a question of fact. In addition, given that there is no privative clause in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, and that the visa officer is determining the applicant's rights rather than dealing with a polycentric issue, to use the words of Bastarache J. in Pushpanathan v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982, there is no doubt that the appropriate standard is reasonableness simpliciter.
I adopt my learned colleague's reasoning in respect to the applicable standard of review of visa officer's decisions.
