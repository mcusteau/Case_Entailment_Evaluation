John v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCT 257, (2003), 26 Imm. L.R. (3d) 221 (F.C.T.D.), and Haghighi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [2000] 4 F.C. 402, (2000), 257 N.R. 139 (F.C.A.), are authority for the proposition that a visa officer must disclose his or her specific concerns to the applicant and grant that person sufficient opportunity to respond to the concerns in a meaningful way. In John, Justice Allen Linden (ex officio) set aside a decision of a visa officer where the applicant was only advised of the reason for being re-interviewed at the hearing itself, and had been refused his request to produce rebuttal evidence after the hearing. Justice Linden found that the applicant, in that case, was denied a meaningful opportunity to respond to the officer's concerns. At paragraphs 6 and 17 to 18 he stated:
[6] The Visa Officer states that the Applicant was given an opportunity to respond to his concerns about the fraudulent birth certificate, but the Applicant disagrees. He states that he was not advised in advance about the subject of the second interview, and that the Visa Officer ignored his explanation and request for an opportunity to prove his relationship to his aunt. This, it is argued, was not a meaningful opportunity to respond.
