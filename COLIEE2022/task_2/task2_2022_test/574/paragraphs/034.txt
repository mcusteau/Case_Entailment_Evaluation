[34]
The Applicant proposed that the following question be certified pursuant to paragraph 74(d) of the Act:
Are individuals seeking resettlement to Canada as members of the Convention Refugee Abroad Class or of the Humanitarian-Protected Persons Abroad Class entitled to a relatively high level of procedural fairness, given the criteria articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Baker and the particular vulnerability of Convention Refugees Abroad?
In my view, this question does not transcend the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation nor does it contemplate issues of broad significance or general application. Further, as the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Ha, above, the content of the duty of fairness is dependent on the facts and context of each case. As such, the question as proposed does not satisfy the test for certification: see Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Liyanagamage (1994), 176 N.R. 4 (F.C.A.) at paragraph 4. I therefore decline to certify any question.
