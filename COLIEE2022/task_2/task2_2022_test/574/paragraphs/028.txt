By sworn affidavit, the Applicant submits that he did not show his military booklet at his first interview on October 15, 2004, that it had been stolen from his home in 1993, and that the officer asked him at his second interview on May 21, 2005, whether he had "found" the document, in reply to which he explained it had been stolen. The Applicant's submission, in essence, is that the officer mistakenly prepared incorrect CAIPS notes during a time of heavy caseload surrounding the first interview.
