[18] In Patel, the Court concluded that the Applicant was advised of the visa officer's concerns and given a full opportunity to respond to them in a second interview. In Patel, however, the prospective immigrant was advised of the purpose of the second interview by a letter in advance of the interview. The Applicant in this case was not advised why he was being re-interviewed until he arrived at the second interview. For this reason, it cannot be said that he was given a full opportunity to respond to the Visa Officer's concerns about the authenticity of his aunt's birth certificate. Had he been told in advance of the purpose of his second interview, or given some time after the interview, he may have been able to gather evidence to meaningfully address the Visa Officer's concerns about the document. This might be done by telephone or other written means of communication.

The duty of fairness requires that an applicant be given notice of the particular concerns of the visa officer and be granted a reasonable opportunity to respond by way of producing evidence to refute those concerns. Where notice is given at the interview itself, the visa officer must allow the Applicant a reasonable period of time in which to meaningfully respond to the allegations.

In this case, the visa officer summoned the Applicant in mid-May 2005 for a second interview convened on May 21, 2005. The Applicant was not given prior notice of the allegations but was confronted with them at the hearing. The Applicant and Respondent differ as to when, during the interview, the Applicant was confronted, a distinction I do not find material. The Applicant was notified of the reason for his second interview, was given an opportunity to respond to the informant's allegations, and did in fact give explanations which the visa officer rejected. The onus lies on the Applicant to provide sufficient evidence to support his application for permanent residence: see Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 152 F.T.R. 316 (T.D.); Dhillon v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 574 (T.D.); and Tahir v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 159 F.T.R. 109 (T.D.).
