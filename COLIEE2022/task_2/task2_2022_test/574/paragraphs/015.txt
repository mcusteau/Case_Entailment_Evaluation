The Federal Court of Appeal in Ha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FCA 49, (2004), 316 N.R. 299 (F.C.A.), reviewed the context of a visa officer deciding an application for permanent residence in Canada and held that the content of the duty of fairness is a question of law that is dependent on the facts of each case. The Applicant here submits that the visa officer breached his duty of procedural fairness by not giving the Applicant a meaningful opportunity to respond to the informant's allegations of criminality. The Applicant contends that he should have been given an opportunity after the second hearing concluded to produce evidence rebutting the claims against him.
