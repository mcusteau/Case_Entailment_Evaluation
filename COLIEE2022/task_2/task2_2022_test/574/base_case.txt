O'Keefe, J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA) for judicial review of a decision by a visa officer, dated May 4, 2006, which denied the applicant permanent residence as a member of the “Convention refugees abroad” class.
[2]
The applicant seeks an order quashing the decision and remitting the matter for redetermination by a different officer.
Background
[3]
The applicant, Mohammad Sadegh Siami Asl, is a citizen of Iran who is currently residing in Japan. He alleged a fear of persecution in Iran on the basis of his political opinion and religion. The circumstances leading to the applicant’s claim were set out in his application for permanent residence as a Convention refugee abroad. While still in Iran, the applicant converted from Islam to the Baha’i faith in 1977, and was involved in the democracy movement. He was arrested in 1979 and sentenced to death for his political activities. However, he was released from prison upon the fall of the monarchy.
[4]
The applicant continued his political activities and the Iranian authorities issued an indictment against him in 1981. He went into hiding and was employed as a truck driver. He transported democratic magazines in his truck, and was arrested in 1984 while visiting his parents. He was imprisoned for six months and was allegedly tortured. The applicant was released on bail in 1985 and was ordered not to leave Iran. His father’s home was put up as surety. He obtained employment driving trucks to various European countries from 1986 until 1990. He did not make any refugee claims while on these trips. The applicant explained that he had been asked by his manager not to seek asylum, as he would lose the truck and cargo.
[5]
In 1990, the applicant received a summons from an Iranian Court and fled to Japan, where he lived for six years before claiming refugee status in 1996. The applicant explained that at the time, he had no knowledge of the Japanese language, or of the country’s legal system. He applied for a Canadian visa in the spring of 1996, which was refused. He also applied for refugee status in Japan, but his claim was refused on the basis that he had not filed his claim within sixty days of his arrival in the country. The applicant has appealed the refusal of his claim by Japan. The applicant was ordered deported from Japan in 1999 and was detained until 2000, when he was provisionally released. The applicant applied for refugee status in Canada while in detention, and his claim was denied for lack of credibility.
[6]
The applicant claims that he converted to Christianity in 2003. He was detained by Japanese authorities in 2005, and applied for refugee status in Canada with help from Amnesty International. His application was sponsored by the Hospitality House Refugee Ministry in Winnipeg. The applicant claimed that he feared persecution in Iran on the basis of his political beliefs and religion. He claimed that the authorities were looking for him, and had destroyed his father’s house when he failed to turn himself in. On April 26, 2006, the applicant was interviewed by a visa officer. By letter dated May 4, 2006, the officer refused his application for permanent residence as a Convention refugee abroad. This is the judicial review of the officer’s decision.
Officer’s Reasons
[7]
The officer assessed the application for permanent residence in Canada as a member of the Convention refugee abroad class, and determined that the applicant did not meet the requirements for immigration to Canada. The applicant did not indicate that he had difficulty understanding the interpreter during the interview.
[8]
The officer first noted the criteria for Convention refugee status under section 96 of IRPA. Under section 145 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, S.O.R./2002-227 (the Regulations), a foreign national is a member of the Convention refugee abroad class if this has been determined outside Canada by an officer. Under paragraph 139(1)(e) of the Regulations, an officer shall issue a permanent resident visa to a foreign national in need of refugee protection, if it is established that he is a member of a class under Division 1 of the Regulations. The officer was not satisfied that the applicant was a member of such a class, as there were inconsistencies in his claim, and he was unable to establish a well-founded fear of persecution.
[9]
Under subsection 11(1) of IRPA, a foreign national must apply for a visa before entering Canada. A visa shall be issued if the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of IRPA. The officer was not satisfied that the applicant met the IRPA requirements for the reasons noted above, and the application was refused. The officer’s notes state:
I reviewed the file carefully. Claim is not credible. While PA claimed having suffered discrimination since about 1979 and having been arrested in 1984, he travelled to Europe a few times between 1985 and 1990 but never took opportunity to claim refugee status. When asked to explain why did not claim refugee status and was returning to Iran, explanations provided are not credible.
Also PA came in Japan in 1990 but waited until 1996 before submitting a refugee application in Japan. Explanations provided for the delay are not credible.
While refugee application to Cda submitted in 2000 was based on the grounds he fear persecution as Bahai, his current application is submitted on the basis of his convertion [sic] to Christianity. In addition, claim that the house of his father was destroyed in government order because the house was on bail for PA’s escape is not substantiated.
The claim is not founded.
Settlement prospects are poor given age, lack of knowledge of any official language of Cda, no relatives in Cda.
Refugee claim not founded.
Application refused on eligibility.
Issues
[10]
The applicant restated the issues at the hearing as follows:
1. Did the officer ignore a key piece of documentary evidence (the original baptismal certificate) in connection with the applicant’s conversion to Christianity?
2. Did the officer fail to correctly apply the law regarding religious conversion specifically with respect to sur place refugees?
Applicant’s Submissions
[11]
The applicant submitted that several findings in the officer’s notes contained errors. It was submitted that the officer based his decision upon inconsistencies in his claim which did not exist. In the alternative, it was submitted that the inconsistencies were not disclosed to the applicant and he was not given the opportunity to respond to them. The applicant submitted that the officer breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness (see Malala v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (2001) 201 F.T.R. 74, 103 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1200 (F.C.T.D.)), and failed to act according to section 13.1 of immigration manual OP5, which states:
Applicants should be questioned about the contradictions in their story. Moreover, any explanation provided by the applicant should be addressed by the officer and they must consider whether the explanation is reasonable in all circumstances. Also, any unresolved inconsistency or concerns regarding an explanation are to be raised by the officer.
[12]
The applicant submitted that the officer failed to provide reasons for concluding that his explanation for not having claimed refugee status while in Europe was not credible. It was submitted that plausibility findings must be based upon facts indicating that a claimant’s story was outside the realm of possibility (see Valtchev v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2001), 208 F.T.R. 267, 107 A.C.W.S. (3d) 293 (F.C.T.D.)). It was submitted that the officer committed a similar error regarding his explanation for delay in making a claim in Japan. He explained that he was unfamiliar with the legal system and that after he found out that he could not obtain a Canadian visa, he made a claim in Japan. It was submitted that any delay was irrelevant, given that Japan accepted so few refugees.
[13]
The applicant submitted that the officer erred in suggesting that he was not credible because his first application was based upon his fear as a Baha’i, and his second was based upon his conversion to Christianity. The officer seemed concerned that his conversion was not genuine due to the apparent inconsistency in the baptism date. The applicant submitted that the legal test for a fear of persecution on religious grounds was not the degree of commitment to the religion or the motive for conversion, but how the conversion would be viewed by the persecutor (see Sadeghi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2002), 117 A.C.W.S. (3d) 798 (F.C.T.D.)). It was submitted that the officer applied the wrong legal test, for assessing a refugee claim based upon religious identity.
[14]
The applicant submitted that the officer failed to properly review the evidence, as the original Japanese certificate stated that he had converted to Christianity in 2003. It was submitted that the officer failed to consider whether he might suffer persecution as a Baha’i and an apostate, even if his conversion to Christianity was not genuine.
[15]
The applicant submitted that the officer ignored relevant documentary evidence, including Iranian court documents. It was submitted that the officer was under a duty to consider all of the evidence, particularly where it contradicted the decision-maker (see Orgona v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2001), 14 Imm. L.R. (3d) 273, 105 A.C.W.S. (3d) 123 (F.C.T.D.)). It was submitted that the officer erred in finding that he had no relatives in Canada, as his application indicated that he had an aunt in Vancouver. It was submitted that the officer also overlooked evidence regarding resettlement, such as his employment in Japan and adaptability. The applicant submitted that the officer ignored evidence that his father’s house had been destroyed.
Respondent’s Submissions
[16]
The respondent submitted that there were inconsistencies and implausibilities in the applicant’s evidence. The applicant traveled to Europe many times between 1985 and 1990, but never sought asylum. It was submitted that it was implausible that he would not seek asylum if he feared persecution in Iran. The respondent noted that he had no trouble leaving Iran although he had been ordered not to leave the country following his release from prison in 1985. It was submitted that the applicant’s delay in claiming refugee status in Japan was inconsistent with his fear of mistreatment.
[17]
The applicant’s baptism certificate indicated that he was baptised in 2005, while he said that he was baptised in 2003. During the interview, the applicant stated that he could not leave Iran because he did not have a passport; however, he also stated that he had traveled outside Iran as a truck driver and did not need a passport to do so. The applicant also stated that he had a commercial passport between 1985 and 1990. In addition, during the interview he stated that he worked as a truck driver in 1975, however, his application indicated that he was a teacher from 1975 until 1981.
[18]
The officer found that the applicant’s credibility was weakened by his demeanour. The applicant hesitated when asked to explain his delay in leaving Iran, and was evasive when asked about his trial in Iran. He also failed to properly answer a question about his refugee status in Japan. Finally, the applicant did not bring all of his previous passports to the interview, as requested by the officer.
[19]
The respondent submitted that the officer was entitled to find that the applicant’s evidence was not credible due to contradictions, inconsistencies and implausibilities in his testimony (see Jarada v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 409). It was submitted that the Court should not disturb a credibility finding unless it was patently unreasonable, and the decision should be considered as a whole (see Ochakovski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2004), 132 A.C.W.S. (3d) 557, 2004 FC 962).
[20]
The respondent submitted that refugee claimants were expected to seek asylum at the first opportunity, and the officer was entitled to consider the applicant’s delay. It was submitted that the officer provided the applicant with a chance to explain these inconsistencies and implausibilities during the interview. The respondent noted the applicant’s statement that he did not want to cause trouble for his manager by claiming refugee status while travelling for work; however the manager helped him leave Iran to work in Europe when he was subject to a court order not to leave the country, and helped him flee in 1990. It was submitted that the officer fully considered the applicant’s explanation for having delayed his refugee claim.
[21]
The respondent submitted that the officer was entitled to rely upon the English translation of the baptism certificate. It was submitted that the officer gave the applicant an opportunity to respond to the inconsistent dates, but the applicant did not indicate that the translation was wrong. The respondent submitted that the officer considered the applicant’s allegation that he would be at risk because of his religious beliefs. The officer doubted the applicant’s conversion to Christianity because he had difficulty answering questions during the interview. In addition, there was no evidence that the alleged conversion would come to the attention of Iranian authorities. The officer noted that the applicant’s allegation that he was at risk as a Baha’i had been considered during his first refugee claim. In addition, the officer found that his claim of being at risk as a Baha’i was not credible.
[22]
The respondent submitted that a decision-maker did not have to refer to every piece of evidence before him and that the lack of reference to a particular piece of evidence did not mean that it had been ignored. The officer had reviewed the file carefully and found that the applicant’s actions since the Iranian court documents were issued in the 1980s were not consistent with a well-founded fear of persecution. It was submitted that the officer did not ignore evidence regarding the destruction of his father’s house, but concluded that these documents did not establish that the authorities were still interested in the applicant. It was submitted that the officer properly assessed evidence regarding his ability to resettle in Canada.
[23]
The respondent submitted that the applicant was dissatisfied with the weight attributed to the evidence by the officer and that it was not the role of the Court to reconsider the evidence that was before the officer (see Hassan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 147 N.R. 317, 36 A.C.W.S. (3d) 635 (F.C.A.)).
Applicant’s Reply
[24]
The applicant submitted that the officer wrongly emphasized his ability to become established in Canada (a regulatory requirement), over his need for protection (a statutory requirement).
[25]
The applicant noted that in addition to the typographical error regarding the date of his baptism, the officer overlooked the fact that the translated certificate indicated that it was signed on “August 23, 20”, which was an obvious error. It was submitted that the officer did nothing to remedy the deficiencies in the translated document. The applicant noted that the officer only asked three questions about his conversion to Christianity, and that he answered them correctly.
[26]
The applicant submitted that in failing to adequately examine his claim of persecution on the basis of his religion, the officer failed to uphold his duty under subsection 3(2) of IRPA, which recognizes that the refugee program is primarily about saving lives and protecting people. It was submitted that the visa officer’s decision was owed little deference, as he did not have expertise in refugee matters.
[27]
The applicant submitted that he had not provided inconsistent information about his employment in 1975. He had indicated that he was a teacher and sought employment as a trucker during the three month summer break.
[28]
The applicant submitted that the respondent had referred to his demeanour during the interview in order to bolster the officer’s finding that he was not credible. It was noted that the officer never referred to the applicant’s demeanour in his letter of May 2006 or his decision, as found in the notes dated April 28, 2006. It was submitted that demeanour was not a credible gauge of credibility (see Lattmer v. Foster Tobacco Company, [1926] 1 D.L.R. 899 (O.S.C.(A.D.)). The applicant noted that he was a native Farsi speaker, who was speaking in Japanese, through an interpreter, to an English-speaking officer. It was noted that the officer only used the words “hesitated” and “evasive” once in his notes. Finally, the applicant submitted that the applicant answered questions about his Japanese refugee claim and indicated that his appeal was pending.
Analysis and Decision
Standard of Review
[29]
A visa officer’s credibility and related factual findings are subject to review on the standard of patent unreasonableness FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED).
[30]
Issue 1
Did the officer ignore a key piece of documentary evidence (the original baptismal certificate) in connection with the applicant’s conversion to Christianity?
Baptismal Certificate
The applicant submitted that the officer erred by basing his negative credibility finding upon erroneous information found in the translated baptismal certificate. Having reviewed the certificates, it appears that the English translation contains two typographical errors:
1. The original certificate indicated that the applicant was baptised on September 14, 2003, while the translated certificate indicated that he was baptised on September 14, 2005; and
2. The original certificate indicated that it was signed by the Pastor on August 23, 2005, while the translated certificate indicated that it was signed on August 23, 20.
The officer was concerned that the applicant’s conversion to Christianity was not bona fide. According to the officer’s notes, the applicant was asked why he said he was baptized on September 14, 2003, when the English translation of his baptismal certificate stated that he was baptized on September 14, 2005. The English translation of the applicant’s Japanese baptismal certificate accompanied his application for permanent residence, which was signed in August 2005. This would mean that the application contained a baptismal certificate which referred to a baptism that had not yet taken place.
[31]
I am satisfied that an error was made when translating the certificate, as the original baptismal certificate shows that it was issued on August 23, 2005. To hold otherwise would mean that the Pastor issued a certificate for a baptism that had not yet taken place. Considered in this manner, there is no contradiction between the applicant’s testimony that he was baptized on September 14, 2003 and the date of baptism contained in the original baptismal certificate.
[32]
The officer makes no reference to the original baptismal certificate in his CAIPS notes nor is it mentioned in his affidavit. In my opinion, the officer ignored relevant evidence regarding the applicant’s conversion to Christianity.
[33]
In my view, it is important to consider that the baptismal certificate was the only piece of objective evidence submitted by the applicant in support of his conversion to Christianity. I believe that it was patently unreasonable for the officer to base his negative credibility finding upon his erroneous interpretation of the documents. Because I have no way of knowing what conclusion the officer would have reached regarding the applicant’s credibility had he considered the evidence contained in the original baptismal certificate, I must set aside the decision and refer the matter to a different officer for redetermination.
[34]
Because of my finding on this issue, I need not deal with the other issues.
[35]
Neither party wished to submit a proposed question of general importance for certification for my consideration.
JUDGMENT
[36]
IT IS ORDERED that
the application for judicial review is allowed and the decision of the officer is set aside and the matter is referred to a different visa officer for redetermination.
