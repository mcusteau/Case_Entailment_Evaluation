PA is a 43 year old male with 3 sponsorable dependants.

PA has not had any further education/training upgrading since that time.
PA has not submitted any documents to show his work experience.
It appears that the PA has been a farmer his whole life.
A basic level of English is a must for day to day living in Canada. A complete lack of English could also be a determent for the health and safety of the PA and others. It appears from the documents submitted, that the PA does not have any language ability.
There is a high family incentive for the PA to remain in Canada past his date of authorized entry.
There is a high economic incentive for the PA to remain in Canada past his date of authorized entry.
