The applicant submits that Haitians returning to their home country are part of a particular social group, namely Haitian returnees. People returning to Haiti are at particular risk of kidnapping and other forms of violence because the "Chim√®res" and street gangs target people from whom they believe they will successfully extort a ransom. In making this argument, the applicant relies on the definition of "particular social group" adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Ward,
above. The relevant passage is the following (at para. 70):
The meaning assigned to "particular social group" in the Act should take into account the general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination that form the basis for the international refugee protection initiative. The tests proposed in
Mayers, supra
,
Cheung, supra
, and
Matter of Acosta, supra
, provide a good working rule to achieve this result. They identify three possible categories:
(1) groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic;
(2) groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and
(3) groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence.
The first category would embrace individuals fearing persecution on such bases as gender, linguistic background and sexual orientation, while the second would encompass, for example, human rights activists. The third branch is included more because of historical intentions, although it is also relevant to the anti-discrimination influences, in that one's past is an immutable part of the person.
