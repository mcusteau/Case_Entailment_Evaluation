The visa officer's reasons for decision are set out in a letter dated May 25, 1998 which says:
"Your application has been refused because you have failed to demonstrate that you are qualified for your intended occupation in Canada, as defined in the NOC description. Employment requirements for this occupation, according to NOC, are a Bachelor's degree, usually in Computer Science, Mathematics, Commerce or Business Administration or completion of a College Program in Computer Science. You have a Bachelor's degree in Nursing and limited training in computer skills. Accordingly, you cannot be awarded any units of assessment under the
Experience
factor, as you have not met the requirement that you have accumulated at least one year of experience in the occupation you intend to follow in Canada."
