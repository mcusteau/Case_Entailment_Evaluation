The visa officer awarded the maximum 10 units under the occupational factor. From that I must infer that she concluded that the applicant meets the NOC qualifications for employment as a computer system analyst including the educational requirements. I must also infer that she concluded that the applicant had performed a substantial number of the main duties of a computer system analyst as set out in NOC 2162, including the essential ones. How then could the visa officer have given the applicant no units for experience?
