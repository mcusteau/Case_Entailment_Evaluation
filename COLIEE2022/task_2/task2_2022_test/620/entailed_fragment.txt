It is well-established that the use of third party affidavits is not fatal to an application for judicial review. Though I do not applaud the use of third person affidavits, I am not prepared to dismiss the application for judicial review on this basis. As the affidavit of Rizni Faruk is based on personal knowledge of the applicants' testimony at the hearing, it is sufficient to support this application.
