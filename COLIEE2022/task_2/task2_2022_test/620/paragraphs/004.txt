Ms. Turcinovica described her intended business in Canada as follows:
"I plan to be a self-employed, commissioned investment and insurance advisor. In addition to my sales, product and accounting knowledge, I am fluent in English, Russian and Latvian. I, therefore, intend to parlay my professional and linquistic (sic) skills to sell insurance and securities to individuals from the ethnic communities to which I belong because many of them do not possess sufficient command of English to venture into the areas in which I wish to specialize; namely, business-owners and individuals seeking to invest in registered educational saving, retirement and retirement income plans (RESP's, RRSP's, and RRIF's)."
