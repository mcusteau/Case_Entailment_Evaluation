At the commencement of oral argument counsel for the Minister submitted that the application for judicial review should be dismissed because it was not supported by a proper affidavit. Ms. Turcinovica had filed no affidavit and the application was supported by the affidavit of Ms. Turcinovica's lawyer's assistant. This was said to fall short of the obligation on an applicant to produce an affidavit based on personal knowledge. In consequence, it was urged on the Minister's behalf that the application should be dismissed because it was not supported by a proper affidavit.
