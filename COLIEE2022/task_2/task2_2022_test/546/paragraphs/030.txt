The Applicant says that the JP's Letter should have been treated as corroboration of the Tenants' existence. However, since the JP did not indicate that he had any first hand knowledge of their presence, it is my view that it was open to the Board to assign no weight to his letter as it related to the Tenants. The situation would have been very different if the JP had said, for example, that he was dining at the Applicant's home, saw the Tenants arrive and go upstairs for the evening.
