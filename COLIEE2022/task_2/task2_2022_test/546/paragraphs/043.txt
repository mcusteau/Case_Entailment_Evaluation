[43]
The Board considered the Applicant's explanation for this inconsistency and rejected it. It was open to the Board to conclude that being tired did not explain why the Applicant could not correctly provide the basic fact of where he and his family lived. As such, it was entitled to draw an adverse inference to the Applicant's credibility.
