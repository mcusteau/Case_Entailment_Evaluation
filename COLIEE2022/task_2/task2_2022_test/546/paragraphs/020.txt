Finally, the Board found that the Applicant's fear of returning to Sri Lanka was not warranted. It said:
I find that if he were to return to Sri Lanka, it would not be the first time the [Applicant] has left the country and returned to Sri Lanka, since, according to the [Applicant], he went to Russia in January 2004, and returned to Sri Lanka in March 2005. According to the [Applicant] upon return to Sri Lanka, he did not have any problems. His only alleged problem is the alleged renting to Tamil couple by his parents.
