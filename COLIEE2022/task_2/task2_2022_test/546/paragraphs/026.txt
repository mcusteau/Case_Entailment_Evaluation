The fifth letter is undated but was written after the Applicant arrived in Canada because it shows his Canadian address. Its author is P. Selvarajah, Attorney-at-Law and Notary Public. He identifies the Applicant as his client and states that the Applicant was arrested on September 16, 2005 and was detained and beaten until March 22, 2006. The letter mentions the Disappearance but not the Tenants (the Lawyer's Letter).
