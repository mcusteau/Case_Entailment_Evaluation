However, in my view, the decisions in
Maldonado
and
Ahortor
were not exactly on point.
Maldonado
stands for the proposition that an applicant's allegations are presumed true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness and, in
Ahortor
, Justice Max Teitelbaum held that a failure to produce corroborating documents cannot support a finding that an applicant lacks credibility without having regard to the evidence about why such evidence is not available.
