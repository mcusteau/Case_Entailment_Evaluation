After briefly reviewing the role of the Commission, the Respondent claims that the Commission's decision was rational and reasonable on the face of the record. The Respondent concedes that the Commission does have the discretion to extend the time-frame within which a complaint is to be submitted and that the Commission did not actually provide reasons for why it felt, in this case, that the time-frame should not be extended; however, the Commission did, in its investigation report, thoroughly analyse the facts of this case against the factors to be taken into consideration when deciding whether to extend the time-frame.
