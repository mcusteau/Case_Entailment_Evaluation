As mentioned earlier, the Respondent first raises a preliminary argument: that portions of the affidavit of Mr. Davey contain material not before the Commission when it rendered its decision and that therefore the Court may not consider these portions of the record. Second, the Respondent submits that decisions of the Commission based on s.41(1)(e) refusals are to be reviewed according to a standard of patent unreasonableness pursuant to the decision of Justice Heneghan of this Court in
Price v. Concord Transportation Inc.
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1202; 238 F.T.R. 113 (F.C.).
