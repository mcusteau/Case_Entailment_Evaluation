A review of the evidence makes it clear that it was not patently unreasonable for the Commission to refuse to hear the complaint on the grounds that it was based on acts that occurred more than one year prior to the Applicant making his claim. The investigation report does broach the issue of the delays allegedly experienced by Mr. Davey in the pursuit of his claim with CCRA; however, the events complained of took place between August and October 19, 2001, and although Mr. Davey was diligently pursuing alternate avenues of redress available to him under his collective agreement, and cannot be faulted for doing so, he did not contact the Commission, or otherwise raise the spectre of discrimination, until October 2003, well past the time-frame within which he ought to have done so.
