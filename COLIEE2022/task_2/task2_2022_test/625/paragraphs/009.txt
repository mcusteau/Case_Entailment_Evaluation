It is true that the visa officer has a responsibility under the
Act
and
Regulations
to decide on applications for a visa. While the Minister has authority under the
Act
to delegate that function to certain people there is no suggestion that it was here delegated to the IPO. The applicant urges that on the basis of cross-examination of the IPO and of the visa officer it is clear that she did participate in the decision-making process and both acknowledged that the IPO might approve applications that were straightforward. In cross-examination however, they both affirmed that a decision to refuse a visa was made only by the visa officer.
