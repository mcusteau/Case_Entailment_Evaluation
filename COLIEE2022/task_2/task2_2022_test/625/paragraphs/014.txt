[14]
At the conclusion of the hearing it was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the court ought to certify, pursuant to s. 83(1) of the
Immigration Act
, the following question:
"Does the principle that only those who hear can decide apply in the context of the determination of an application for an employment authorization?"
Having considered the matter I determine that the question ought not to be certified since it seems to me clear that the principle underlying that question has no application in relation to an administrative decision, even a discretionary decision, as was involved in this case. The proposed question is not a serious question of general importance in these circumstances.
Application dismissed.
