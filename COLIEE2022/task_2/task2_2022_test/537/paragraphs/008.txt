The applicant argues the Immigration Counsellor committed a reviewable error by failing to be "alert, alive and sensitive" to the best interests of his child as required by subsection 25(1) and the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; 243 N.R. 22. The relevant portion of
Baker
is found at paragraph 75, where L'Heureux-Dub√©, J., stated:
"[F]or the exercise of the discretion to fall within the standard of reasonableness, the decision-maker should consider children's best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them. That is not to say that children's best interests must always outweigh other considerations, or that there will not be other reasons for denying an H & C claim even when children's interests are given this consideration. However, where the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister's guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable."
