In a letter dated December 4, 2002, the Immigration Counsellor informed the applicant of her decision to deny his H & C application. In her Report to File, the Immigration Counsellor summarized the key points of the application and the rationale for her decision. She noted the interests of the applicant's child favoured a waiver of subsection 11(1), but also considered several factors that did not support a waiver of subsection 11(1). Those factors were listed at page 3 of her decision:
- Applicant has received due process under the refugee program.
- Applicant is currently separated from his Canadian wife.
- Applicant's parent's care for their grandchild while the applicant is working.
- No known medical problems that would impede his return to Mexico.
