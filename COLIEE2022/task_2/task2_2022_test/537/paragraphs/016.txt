The only remaining issue is the reasonableness of the Immigration Counsellor's finding that the applicant's son will continue to receive a "caring and nurturing environment from his mother" if the applicant is removed. This determination was made by Counsellor Araujo after two interviews with Ms. Atfield and a review of the relevant circumstances. She was aware of Ms. Atfield's problems and specifically mentioned some of them in her report. Even so, she obviously felt Ms. Atfield was in a position to offer her son a caring and nurturing environment regardless of the applicant's removal. The Court does not have first-hand access to Ms. Atfield and is not in a position to second-guess the Immigration Counsellor's assessment of her parenting abilities.
