Applying these principles to the case at bar, it is apparent the applicant is in essence asking the Court to re-weigh the evidence. There is no legal basis to the applicant's claim that Counsellor Araujo erred by not explicitly discussing the possibility that it is in the best interests of his child for him to remain in Canada. It can be safely assumed that officers are aware that a child is generally better off living in Canada with both of his or her parents than living in Canada without one of his or her parents. To require this fact to be mentioned explicitly in every decision would elevate form above substance, precisely what DÃ©cary, J.A., warned against in
Hawthorne v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2002), 297 N.R. 187; 24 Imm. L.R.(3d) 34; 2002 FCA 475, at paragraphs 3-6 when he stated:
"[T]o insist as a matter of law that an immigration officer spell out expressly that she had considered the best interests of the child before examining the degree of hardship to which the child would be subject, is to elevate form above substance.
"The 'best interests of the child' are determined by considering the benefit to the child of the parent's non-removal from Canada as well as the hardship the child would suffer from either her parent's removal from Canada or her own voluntary departure should she wish to accompany her parent abroad. Such benefits and hardship are two sides of the same coin, the coin being the best interests of the child.
"The officer does not assess the best interests of the child in a vacuum. The officer may be presumed to know that living in Canada can offer a child many opportunities and that, as a general rule, a child living in Canada with her parent is better off than a child living in Canada without her parent. The inquiry of the officer, it seems to me, is predicated on the premise, which need not be stated in the reasons, that the officer will end up finding, absent exceptional circumstances, that the 'child's best interests' factor will play in favour of the non-removal of the parent. In addition to what I would describe as this implicit premise, the officer has before her a file wherein specific reasons are alleged by a parent, by a child or, as in this case, by both, as to why non-removal of the parent is in the best interests of the child. These specific reasons must, of course, be carefully examined by the officer.
"To simply require that the officer determine whether the child's best interests favour non-removal is somewhat artificial -such a finding will be a given in all but a very few, unusual cases. For all practical purposes, the officer's task is to determine, in the circumstances of each case, the likely degree of hardship to the child caused by the removal of the parent and to weigh this degree of hardship together with other factors, including public policy considerations, that militate in favour of or against the removal of the parent."
