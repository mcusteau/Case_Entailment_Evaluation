Counsellor Araujo's analysis of the best interests of the applicant's child complied fully with the guidance provided by Décary, J., in
Hawthorne
. She analysed the degree of hardship the child would suffer if the applicant were removed, and considered both the possibility of the child remaining in Canada and the possibility of him accompanying the applicant to Mexico. Not surprisingly, she concluded the child's best interests favoured the non-removal of the applicant. Nonetheless, she was of the opinion that the degree of hardship the child would suffer would be relatively low and when weighed together with other factors was not enough to warrant a waiver of subsection 11(1) of the
IRPA
. It is apparent from her extensive analysis of the issue that Counsellor Araujo was "alert, alive and sensitive" to the best interests of the applicant's child and did not minimize the child's interests in a manner inconsistent with Canada's humanitarian and compassionate tradition. Nothing in the law required Counsellor Araujo to accord greater weight to the best interests of the applicant's son than to the other factors she considered. While it is an important part of the analysis, this factor is not a trump card and will not always be decisive. As Décary, J.A., stated in
Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2002), 288 N.R. 174; 212 D.L.R.(4th) 139; 2002 FCA 125, at para. 12:
"In short, the immigration officer must be 'alert, alive and sensitive' (
Baker
, para. 75) to the interests of the children, but once she has well identified and defined this factor, it is up to her to determine what weight, in her view, it must be given in the circumstances.
The presence of children, contrary to the conclusion of Justice Nadon [at the Trial level], does not call for a certain result. It is not because the interests of the children favour the fact that a parent residing illegally in Canada should remain in Canada (which, as justly stated by Justice Nadon, will generally be the case), that the Minister must exercise his discretion in favour of said parent
. Parliament has not decided, as of yet, that the presence of children in Canada constitutes in itself an impediment to any 'refoulement' of a parent illegally residing in Canada (see
Langner v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1995), 184 N.R. 230 (F.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1995] S.C.C.A. No. 241; SCC 24740, August 17, 1995)." (Emphasis added.)
