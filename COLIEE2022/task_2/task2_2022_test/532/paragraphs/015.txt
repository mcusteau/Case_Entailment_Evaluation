In my view, the issue of jurisdiction here raised has been settled, at least in this court, by the decision of Mr. Justice Pratte for the Court of Appeal in
Canatonquin v. Gabriel
, [1980] 2 F.C. 792 at p. 793 where he said:
"We see no merit in the appellants' contention that the Trial Division does not have jurisdiction because the only issue raised by the action, namely the validity of the election of the defendants to the council of the Band, is governed by customary Indian law and not by a federal statute."
In that case the Court of Appeal upheld a decision of then Associate Chief Justice Thurlow of this court that the council of a band is a "federal board" within the meaning of s. 2 of the
Federal Court Act
and that the Trial Division under s. 18 had jurisdiction in a case where the issue raised was the validity of elections to the council under customary law of the band concerned.
