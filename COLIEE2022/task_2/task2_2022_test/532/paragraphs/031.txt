I turn to the matter urged on behalf of the defendants, which I deal with as urging that in this case the court ought not to exercise its discretion to grant injunctive relief. It is urged that however the court may appraise the process followed by the council in purporting to remove the Chief from office under the Custom Election Bylaw, the determination of the custom is a matter for the Tribe and not for the court. It is urged that the application of procedural standards applicable to other bodies ought not to be automatically applied in this case because of the significance of the customary law of the Tribe in this matter.
