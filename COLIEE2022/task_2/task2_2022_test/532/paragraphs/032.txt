I have already indirectly dealt with this in determining that the council's actions are matters within the jurisdiction of the court and in determining that a serious issue is raised in regard to the process followed by the council. I am not persuaded that the court should decline to exercise its discretion to grant relief of the nature sought on the ground urged. In doing so I underline that at this stage the court makes no judgment about the process followed. That issue will be resolved another day if the action initiated by the plaintiff goes forward. In that event there will have been full opportunity to assess whether, as the defendants' argument implies, the members of the elected council not including the elected Chief are the interpreters of the customary law of the Blood Tribe. I note that the Blood Tribe Custom Election Bylaw was adopted by another process, one that included the then Chief of the Tribe.
