If the words of Pratte, J.A., above quoted were changed to delete "the election of the defendants to" and to insert therefor "the removal of the plaintiff from", they would aptly describe the issue raised in this application by the defendants, that is, that application of the election bylaw is a matter of customary law and not a matter of federal statutory law.
