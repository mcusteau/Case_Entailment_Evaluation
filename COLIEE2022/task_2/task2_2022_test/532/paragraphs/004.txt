Differences developed between Chief Frank and the defendant members of the council at some time following their election to office in November 1992. The differences concern the respective responsibilities and authority of the elected Chief on the one hand, and the elected members of the council on the other. The differences were seen by the defendants as changes proposed, without prior discussion with council, in the respective roles of the Chief and the council, as these were described in documents which the defendants believe originated with Chief Frank and some others seen by the defendants to be his advisers. Matters came to a head in early March when the plaintiff purchased a herd of buffalo and sought to sell some of the Tribe's cow/calf herd, actions for which the defendant members of council said he had no authority, though he says otherwise.
