On March 7 members of council met in special session, apparently without the Chief being present, and adopted a resolution that council proceed to remove Chief Frank from office pursuant to provisions of the Blood Tribe Custom Election Bylaw. A further resolution purported to suspend the plaintiff from office until there be a hearing and a final decision made about his removal from office. Chief Frank was advised of this action by letter of March 8 and the following day, on letterhead of the Blood Tribe Chief and council, a statement of grounds for removal of Harley Frank as Chief of the Blood Tribe, signed by all twelve named defendants as councillors was addressed to the plaintiff and served upon him. It sets out particulars of allegations that Chief Frank is guilty of neglect of duty, malfeasance, and misconduct that reflects on the dignity and integrity of the Blood Tribe Council. That statement identifies that the council purported to act under the Custom Election Bylaw, that a date for hearing of the matter before council would be set, that he would be advised and given "full opportunity to answer the charges ... and to make submissions as to why you should not be removed from office pursuant to s. 11.01 of the Bylaw".
