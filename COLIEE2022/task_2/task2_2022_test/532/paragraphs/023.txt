The defendants urge that there is no evidence of a serious issue. Rather, the plaintiff is merely dissatisfied with the steps that council has taken in what the defendants unanimously perceive to be the exercise of their responsibilities to the Tribe, and as members of the council. They urge that the only disruption or disorder arising from the decision complained of is that which comes as a result of the plaintiff's reactions. In my view, these submissions do not acknowledge the crux of the issue raised but rather assume it is not an issue, that is, the question of the validity of action taken by the defendants.
