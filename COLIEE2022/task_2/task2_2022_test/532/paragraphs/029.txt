I am persuaded that in this case the balance of convenience favours the continuance of injunctive orders earlier issued on an interim basis. The irreparable harm that would be caused to the plaintiff if the injunction order is not now granted and he should subsequently succeed at trial of the action he has initiated outweighs the harm likely to be caused to the defendants acting as council for the Tribe if the injunction continues and it subsequently turns out that the plaintiff is unsuccessful in the action.
