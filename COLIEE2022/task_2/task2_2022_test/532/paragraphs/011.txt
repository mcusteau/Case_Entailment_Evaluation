The plaintiff urges that matters raised in these proceedings are within the court's jurisdiction and that the circumstances warrant the granting of an interlocutory injunction. The defendants question the jurisdiction of the court to grant the relief sought in the special circumstances of this case. They contest the merits of the application for interlocutory relief of the nature sought, and they urge that discretion of the court should not be exercised in this case, even if it has jurisdiction and the usual requirements for an injunction are otherwise met. The last of these, as presented in argument, concerned the issue whether the defendants could be said, as the plaintiff alleges, not to have followed the process set out in the bylaws under which the defendants purported to act.
