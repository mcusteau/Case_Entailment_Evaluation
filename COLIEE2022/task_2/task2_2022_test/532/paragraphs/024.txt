The statement of claim filed herein raises, in relation to declaratory relief sought, the validity of the Custom Election Bylaw and it urges there is a serious issue raised in relation to the respective authority of the Chief and of the council. The latter issue lies at the heart of the confrontation that has unfortunately developed between the plaintiff as Chief and the defendants as council. Whether all forms of declaratory relief prayed for in the statement of claim will be seen as appropriate is not for this court at this stage to assess. As the defendants suggest, it seems anomalous for the plaintiff claiming office as Chief by reason of his election under the Custom Election Bylaw to question that very Bylaw in his statement of claim. Nevertheless, it needs to be stressed that the statement of claim initiating the action was prepared in a short time following the telephone conference with Mr. Justice Muldoon leading to his interim order on March 19. That statement of claim may be amended at any time before a defence is filed, and thereafter on leave of the court, so that the relief set out initially, or other parts of the statement of claim, may well be modified before trial.
