The serious issue raised is said to concern the validity of the decision made by the defendants acting as council of the Tribe on March 25, 1993 to remove the plaintiff from the office of Chief to which he had been duly elected under the Blood Tribe Custom Election Bylaw. It is submitted that action violated the spirit of the interim order of Mr. Justice Muldoon issued on March 19, 1993, that the action was not in accord with provisions of the Custom Election Bylaw and that the procedures followed by defendants as members of council violated basic principles of natural justice and of fairness.
