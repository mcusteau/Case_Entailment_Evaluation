Pelletier, J., as he then was, while not using the word "threshold", reached the same conclusion in
Chan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] F.T.R. Uned. 192; [2002] F.C.J. No. 376 (T.D.), 2002 FCT 270, when he stated at paragraphs 14-16:
"It is not obvious from the material before the tribunal when the applicant would have established residence in Canada ... in the absence of having established a residence, these periods of presence in Canada could not maintain a residence which had not been established.
"... [The citizenship judge] addressed his mind to the establishment of a residence and concluded that he could not find that the applicant had established a residence in Canada ...
"Counsel's representations as to the effect of the decision of Lutfy, A.C.J., in
Lam
, supra, do not assist the applicant because the issue in this case is whether residence has been established, not whether it has been maintained. There is no disagreement on the question of whether residence must be established before it can be maintained, so there is no opportunity to follow one line of cases or the other. There is only one line of cases."
