I was urged to consider the fact that the appellant lived in Canada for 15 months before leaving for his employment in Afghanistan. The appellant referred to several cases where an individual was found to have established residence in Canada after residing here considerably less than 15 months. The appellant's perception of the end result in those cases is correct but he fails to appreciate the nature and significance of the evidence that was provided in support of the end result. A review of the cases reveals that significant evidence was tendered to indicate that the individuals had established their residence in Canada prior to departing. Here, the only evidence proffered by the appellant regarding the 15 month time frame was that he arrived in Canada on July 24, 1994 and worked for a short time with the Canadian African Women's Organization in September 1994. He was not able to obtain employment in his area of expertise and on January 2, 1995 he left Canada for a job interview with the United Nations in New York. He was successful and received an offer as a field officer with the World Health Organization assigned to Afghanistan commencing October 18, 1995. There was nothing further. Given the paucity of evidence before the citizenship judge with respect to the 15 month period between the appellant's arrival in and departure from Canada, I cannot conclude that she erred in failing to find that the appellant had established his residence in Canada at that time.
