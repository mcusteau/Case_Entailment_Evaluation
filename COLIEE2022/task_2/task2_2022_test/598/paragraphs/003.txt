The appellant submits two grounds of appeal. The first is that the citizenship judge's reasons and analysis are insufficient and inadequate. The second ground is that the judge failed to consider all of the appellant's surrounding circumstances when dealing with his application. The respondent, on the other hand, refers to the divergence of approaches taken by the Federal Court to the residency requirement of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the
Act
. Here, says the respondent, the citizenship judge chose the approach set out in
Koo, Re
, [1993] 1 F.C. 286; 59 F.T.R. 27 (T.D.), applied the factors set out therein and determined that the appellant simply had not satisfied the residence requirements. The reasons and analysis are not deficient, argues the respondent, they are complete.
