In
R. v. Sheppard (C.)
(2002), 284 N.R. 342; 211 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 50; 633 A.P.R. 50; 210 D.L.R.(4th) 608 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada discussed the adequacy of reasons. Although decided in the context of criminal law, the principles enunciated in
Sheppard
can be modified, as required, to fit the context of any number of matters. The Supreme Court held that the requirement of reasons is tied to their purpose and the purpose varies with the context. For purposes of citizenship appeals, I consider the following propositions from
Sheppard
, modified as required for the context, to be applicable:
(a) The delivery of reasoned decisions is inherent in the judge's role.
(b) An unsuccessful applicant should not be left in doubt as to why he or she was not successful.
(c) Lawyers for parties may require reasons to assist them in considering and advising with respect to a potential appeal.
(d) Not every failure or deficiency in the reasons provides a ground of appeal.
(e) Reasons provide an important function in the appellate process. Where the functional needs are not satisfied, the appellate court may conclude there is an error of law depending on the circumstances of the case and the nature and importance of the decision being rendered.
(f) The judge is not held to some abstract standard of perfection.
(g) The judge's duty is satisfied by reasons which are sufficient to serve the purpose for which the duty is imposed, i.e., a decision which, having regard to the particular circumstances of the case, is reasonably intelligible to the parties and provides the basis for meaningful appellate review of the correctness of the judge's decision.
(h) While it is presumed that judges know the law with which they work day in and day out and deal competently with the issues of fact, the presumption is of limited relevance. Even learned judges can err in particular cases, and it is the correctness of the decision in a particular case that the parties are entitled to have reviewed by the appellate court.
(i) Where the decision is deficient in explaining the result to the parties, but the appeal court considers itself able to do so, the appeal court's explanation, in its own reasons, is sufficient. There is no need in that case for a new hearing.
