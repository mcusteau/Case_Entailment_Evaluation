The question, then, is the extent of Mr. Valère's own involvement in crimes against humanity. In this regard, the Board doubted Mr. Valère's claim that he had never witnessed any abuses carried out by his fellow officers. In the Board's view, Mr. Valère must have known what was going on. According to the respondent, awareness of the crimes of others, even on the part of a junior officer, was enough to make Mr. Valère complicit in the crimes of his fellow officers. This was especially so, the respondent says, when one took into account the fact that Mr. Valère voluntarily spent three years with the HNP.
