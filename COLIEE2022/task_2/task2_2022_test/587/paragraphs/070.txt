[70]
I repeat the paragraph setting out the report's conclusion about the PFLP:
"After carefully reviewing all of the evidence, I find that the PFLP is an international terrorist organization likely ('susceptible') to engage in acts of violence that would or could endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. Although it has not actively committed acts of violence in Canada, it has not publicly renounced the use of violence. There is still a possibility for the PFLP to commit acts of violence in Canada."
The applicant reads the last sentence as emphasizing a mere possibility. The Attorney General reads the first sentence of the paragraph as the finding of the tribunal. In my opinion, the latter is the appropriate reading of this passage in the report for it clearly states the finding that the PFLP is an organization likely ("susceptible") to engage in acts of violence as described.
