I am persuaded by the applicant's argument that the function of SIRC under s. 39 of the
Act
is somewhat different from the functions of the same committee in dealing with generally similar investigations or complaints concerning actions of CSIS or denial of security clearance to public servants under ss. 41 and 42 of the
CSIS Act
. In the latter cases, at the conclusion of its investigation SIRC is directed to provide a report containing any recommendations the Committee considers appropriate. Under s. 39(9) of the
Immigration Act
, SIRC "shall, on completion of an investigation ... make a report to the Governor-in-Council containing its conclusion whether or not a certificate should be issued under s. 40(1) and the grounds on which that conclusion is based". In
Thomson
, supra, Mr. Justice Cory for the majority of the Supreme Court, with reference to SIRC's report on completion of an investigation under s. 42 of the
CSIS Act
concerning a complaint by a public servant about denial of security clearance, emphasized that the word "recommendations" is to be given its clear meaning and the decision-maker, in that case the Deputy Minister concerned, is not bound by the report and recommendations of SIRC. While that case is distinguishable, the roles of SIRC in both types of proceedings, i.e., an investigation of a complaint of a public servant about the denial of security clearance and an investigation in regard to a report by the Ministers concerned under s. 39(2) of the
Act
, are comparable. The ultimate decision-maker, in this case the Governor General-in-Council, like the Deputy Minister in Thomson, to paraphrase Cory, J., at p. 402 of [1992] 1 S.C.R., in my opinion, is subject to the duty to comply with the principles of procedural fairness in the context of decision-making with regard to security considerations.
