[31]
The issue here raised cannot be considered as a matter of principle without reference to the relief sought, for certain relief in an action for judicial review, available under s. 18 of the court's statute, may be sought and would be more appropriately directed with reference to SIRC itself. Here the relief sought in IMM-4557-93 is an order to quash or set aside the SIRC decision. If prohibition or an injunction were sought against SIRC's processes that relief could only arise in regard to the SIRC processes without awaiting a further stage in the process.
