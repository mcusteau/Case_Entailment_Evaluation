I am persuaded that, as the CCLA expresses it, the nature of the defined organization is irrelevant to the question whether s. 19(1)(g) infringes freedom of association, though it may be a relevant consideration under s.Â 1 of the
Charter
. In my opinion, by providing ultimately for deportation of permanent residents who are members of an organization loosely defined, the statute does infringe on the freedom of permanent residents to associate together in organizations. Often such persons, at least those comparatively new to this country, may maintain association or membership with organizations, associated with their homelands, many of which may have had some historic record of violence but which serve a variety of purposes, as the PFLP was found to do in this case. To expose all permanent residents to the possibility of deportation because of their membership in such organizations, in my view clearly infringes on their freedom of association.
