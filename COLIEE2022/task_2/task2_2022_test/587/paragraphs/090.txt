The applicant submits that s. 19(1)(g) as drafted is overly broad. It does not distinguish between organizations dedicated exclusively to violent activities that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada and other organizations with a variety of purposes which may embrace members with limited involvement only in peaceful purposes. It includes persons, solely because of their association, who are not themselves likely to engage in acts of violence or unlawful activities in Canada.
