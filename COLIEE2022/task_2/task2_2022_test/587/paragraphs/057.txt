It is true that not all of the evidence before SIRC was discussed in detail in its report, but the report does include a summary of the evidence provided, both by CSIS, so far as that was provided to the applicant, and by the applicant. On the basis of SIRC's summary of the evidence, I am not persuaded that its findings can be characterized as perverse, capricious or without support in the evidence before it. Thus, in regard to the key findings of fact by SIRC there is no basis established for the court to intervene.
