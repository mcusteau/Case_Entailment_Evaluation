There is no question in my mind that the decision of SIRC is clearly a decision subject to judicial review pursuant to ss. 18 and 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
. Counsel does not dispute that SIRC is a "federal board, commission or tribunal" as defined in s. 2 of that
Act
since it is a body exercising jurisdiction or powers conferred by an Act of Parliament. Relief against a decision of SIRC is available under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
, upon application for judicial review pursuant to s. 18.1. Whether jurisdiction should be exercised in an application questioning that decision, rather than questioning a decision at a later stage in the process, or, as in this case, in addition to questioning such a later decision, is a matter for the court's discretion. It is urged that SIRC's decision is not a final decision in the process of considering the applicant's situation, but I note it is a final, not an interlocutory, decision of SIRC itself. By statute, s. 39(9) of the
Act
, SIRC is directed to "make a report to the Governor General-in-Council containing its conclusion whether or not a certificate should be issued under s. 40(1) and the grounds on which that conclusion is based". That is more akin to a final decision, in my view, than SIRC is directed to make under s. 42 of the
CSIS Act
which, in
Thomson v. Canada (Minister of Agriculture)
, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 385; 133 N.R. 345; 89 D.L.R.(4th) 218; 3 Admin. L.R.(2d) 242, was characterized as an authority to make a recommendation.
