In relation to the issue of his membership in the PFLP, the SIRC report does not find his denial credible. It is urged that having accepted the applicant's own evidence that he was the closest person in Canada to the PFLP, that he was in a position of trust, had received and distributed moneys for purposes serving the organization, had participated in activities serving its interests and had attended at its meetings, SIRC then rejects his denial of membership as not credible, without articulating reasons for rejecting his credibility on the key question of membership. Moreover, it is well established that a tribunal may not ignore relevant evidence and here there was evidence of other witnesses who had long known him who did not believe he was a member of the PFLP. Moreover, SIRC is said to have ignored the close family relationship of the applicant and his father, and gave no consideration to the implications of that in assessing Mr. Al Yamani's relationship to the PFLP. It also ignored as well the applicant's reported writings and conduct that were inconsistent with membership in the organization.
