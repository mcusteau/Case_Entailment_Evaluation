I am not, however, persuaded that s. 19(1)(g) has any nexus to, any particular effect upon, freedom of expression, separate from its effects upon freedom of association. Its effect is ultimately to terminate the exercise of free expression in Canada by persons affected, as well as to terminate the exercise of the other freedoms assured by the
Charter
, by reason of their exclusion or removal from Canada. Yet without some greater impact upon freedom of expression than upon other freedoms, some more direct effect upon that particular freedom than upon others, I am not persuaded that s. 19(1)(g) can be said to violate that freedom. It is true that SIRC relied upon evidence of Mr. Al Yamani's activities, including his own admissions about those, in reaching its conclusion that he was a member of the PFLP, thus bringing him within the statutory provision, but that does not mean that the effect of s. 19(1)(g) can be said to restrict freedom of expression.
