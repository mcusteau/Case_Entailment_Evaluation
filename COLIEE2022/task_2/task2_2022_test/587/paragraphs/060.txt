The submission that the conclusion that the PFLP would commit acts of violence in Canada is said to be unreasonable where there was "overwhelming evidence" of the unlikelihood of the PFLP acting violently in Canada and no clear, or soundly based, evidence to the contrary. The academic experts testifying, called on behalf of the applicant and one by SIRC itself, all testified that the PFLP had never committed any act of violence in North America, that it had abandoned or rejected international terrorism over 20 years ago and had expelled the only faction within the organization that still supported international terrorism. The only evidence to the contrary was that of CSIS officers, which the applicant discounts because in cross-examination the principal witness from CSIS in relation to this issue acknowledged that his knowledge base was related to international terrorist organizations in general and not directly related to the PFLP. Counsel for the Attorney General contests that characterization of the evidence of the CSIS officer concerned which it is said demonstrates more knowledge and understanding of the PFLP organization than the applicant's description of his evidence would indicate. Moreover, the CSIS officer's evidence concerned the basis of earlier activities of the PFLP, including international airline hijacking, and of the PFLP position to seek to dispossess Israel from lands in the occupied territories and within the accepted international borders of Israel, by force and by violent activities through much of the last 20 years. Moreover, its leaders had never publicly disavowed resort to terrorism and violence. The known history of international terrorist organizations generally is a story of unpredictable, violent activities, initiated wherever in the world is seen as likely to draw attention to and support for their objectives. The CSIS officer's opinion is reported in SIRC's report and is obviously relied upon in its conclusion that the PFLP is an international terrorist organization likely ("susceptible") to engage in acts of violence that would or could endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada.
