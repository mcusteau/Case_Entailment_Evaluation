Act
is unconstitutional, i.e., invalid, in light of certain provisions of the

(the "
Charter
"), both of those parties were directed to provide notice of a constitutional question to Attorneys General of the provinces in accord with s. 57 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 as amended. Since those notices related to similar constitutional issues also raised by CCLA, the latter, as a late intervenor, was not directed to provide separate notice under s. 57. No provincial Attorney General made application to intervene in the proceedings.
