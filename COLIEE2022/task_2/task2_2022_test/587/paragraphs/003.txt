Upon application for leave and for judicial review in relation to the first decision, by SIRC, filed August 18, 1993, leave was granted and the matter set down for hearing, ultimately in May 1994. At that stage the respondents named included the Solicitor General for Canada and the Minister of Employment and Immigration, with the Security Intelligence Review Committee, initially named as a respondent, subsequently named as an intervenor. When the hearing commenced on May 16, preliminary issues were raised and submissions upon them made, but when reference was made to the second application for leave and for judicial review, (IMM-2197-94, filed on April 29, 1994), upon consent of all present the hearing was adjourned, the Crown agreeing to consent to allowing leave and for hearing of the second application for judicial review, to be arranged on an expedited basis at the same time as the first application. In the result the arrangements then settled led to hearing of both applications, essentially involving the same factual background, at a hearing on August 16, 17, 18 and 19, 1994. In the interim between the hearings the Canadian Arab Federation ("CAF") and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association ("CCLA") applied for status as Intervenors. After hearing counsel for the parties by telephone, the application of CAF was allowed, and subsequently that of CCLA was allowed, and both organizations were admitted as intervenors, on terms. They were heard at the hearing of the applications in relation to certain of the issues raised, as noted hereafter. In addition, before the hearing, SIRC was admitted as an intervenor in respect of the application in IMM-2197-94. Thus the intervenors in hearings of both applications were the same three, SIRC, CAF and CCLA, each represented by its own counsel.
