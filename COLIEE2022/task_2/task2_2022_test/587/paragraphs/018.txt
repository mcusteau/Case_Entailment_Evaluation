On August 25 the Governor General-in-Council issued an Order-in-Council, P.C. 1993-1677, reciting that, after considering the report of SIRC, it was satisfied, based on the grounds set out in the report, that the applicant was a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
. That decision also directed the Solicitor General to issue a security certificate pursuant to s. 40 so designating the applicant. On September 28, 1993, the Solicitor General issued a certificate under that section, although the fact of its issue and a copy of the certificate was not provided to the applicant until April 1994 when he was summoned to an inquiry under the
Act
, the result of which was anticipated to be the issuance of a deportation order against the applicant upon finding by the Adjudicator that he is a person named in the certificate issued under s. 40(1). As earlier indicated, in April, 1994 the second application, in file IMM-2197-94, concerning the decision of the Governor General-in-Council was filed.
