[109]
On the basis of the Court of Appeal decision in
Canepa
, it is my view that the SIRC process in this case does not raise an issue in respect of s. 7 of the
Charter
. Thus the applicant's claims and that of CCLA with reference to s. 7 of the
Charter
do not succeed. Further, I am not persuaded that the particular aspects of the SIRC process raised by the applicant do violate the principles of fundamental justice, or basic fairness, at common law in relation to the hearing by SIRC. Three particulars of the SIRC process were said to do so by the applicant.
