For the respondents it is submitted that there is no unconstitutional interference with freedom of association under the
Charter
. In the context of this case it is urged that where the applicant has been found to be a chapter leader of an organization, here found to be a terrorist organization, an organization that is likely to engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives and safety of persons in Canada, no constitutional right is infringed if he were to be deported. The applicant is a permanent resident, not a citizen, with the right to remain in Canada only as defined by the
Act
. Section 19(1)(g) is said to have a purpose of promoting the safety of persons in Canada, protecting them from terrorist activities, in respect of all three categories of persons included in that provision. It is urged that purpose cannot be said to be unconstitutional, nor can the effects of the provision, which are to exclude, or to remove after entry, persons who are members of organizations likely to commit acts of the described violence. For the Attorney General it is said there is no constitutionally protected right to be a member of such an organization.
