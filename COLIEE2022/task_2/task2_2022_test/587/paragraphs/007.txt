The applicant, Mr. Al Yamani, is a stateless person, a male of Palestinian origin, now 39 years of age. His father was said to be one of the founders of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (the "PFLP") and the applicant grew up knowing many of the leaders of that organization and some of the leaders in the Palestine Liberation Organization (the "PLO"). Though he was born in Beirut, he is not a citizen of Lebanon but he has carried and has travelled on a travel document issued by the Lebanese government. It is said he may not return to Lebanon, possibly because of the concerns in Canada about his status as a person presenting a security risk to others.
