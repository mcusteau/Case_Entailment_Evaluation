In light of CAF's intention to argue constitutional questions in regard to s. 15 of the
Charter
, in advance of hearing these applications I directed CAF to serve notice pursuant to s. 57 of the
Federal Court Act
, of its intent to deal with s. 15 as an issue which it perceived was already raised by the parties. The applicant had already served notice in accord with s. 57. I further directed that the standing of CAF, as intervenor, to raise a constitutional question independently of any question raised by the parties in argument, if that were the case, should be an issue for consideration at the hearing.
