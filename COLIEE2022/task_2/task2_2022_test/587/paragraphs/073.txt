I am not persuaded that the purpose of s. 19(1)(g) was so indirect as that. In my opinion the class of persons we are here concerned with are those who there are reasonable grounds to believe are members of an organization that is likely ("susceptible") to engage in acts of violence of the type described. On its face that group of persons is within the paragraph upon findings that he or she is a member of an organization and that the organization is likely to engage in those acts. There is no necessity, in construing the words as written, to establish the obligations of membership in such an organization or that the individual member concerned has a record of, or an obligation to participate in, acts of violence under the aegis and on direction of the organization.
