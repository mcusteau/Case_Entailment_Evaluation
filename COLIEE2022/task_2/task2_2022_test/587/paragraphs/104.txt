In my view "reading down" the provision here in question is not an appropriate course in this case. Section 19(1)(g) was enacted before the
Charter
became law in 1982. Insofar as there is evidence of intention, from the briefing note for the Minister of the day, the provision was drafted to include members of an organization even though as individuals they had no record or likelihood of engaging in acts of violence but the organization is perceived to present a threat of such activity. It is far from clear that when the provision was enacted Parliament intended to have the paragraph "read down". It is clear that such an approach could not be considered to contemplate the provisions of the
Charter
, enacted some five years after ss. 19(1)(e) and (g) were enacted.
