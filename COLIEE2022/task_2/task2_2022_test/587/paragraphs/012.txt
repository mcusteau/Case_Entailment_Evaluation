I return to describe the process followed in regard to the applicant after he was advised by the letter dated May 29, 1992 that the Ministers concerned had reported to SIRC that they were of opinion he was a security risk under specified paragraphs of the
Act
. He was subsequently the subject of a hearing before a single member of SIRC, the Honourable JacquesÂ Courtois, Chairman of SIRC, who was designated to conduct the investigation, which took place over seven days, in December 1992 and February 1993.
