[126]
In court file IMM-4557-93 an order goes setting aside the report and conclusion of SIRC, dated August 3, 1993, insofar as that was based upon the finding that the applicant was a person who there are reasonable grounds to believe is a member of an organization that is likely to engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada, as described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
. The application seeks an order that the matter be remitted to SIRC for consideration by a differently constituted panel. My order does not so direct.
