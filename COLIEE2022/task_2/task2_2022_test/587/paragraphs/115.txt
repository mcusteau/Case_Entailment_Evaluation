I do not agree, however, that the principles of fundamental justice require counsel be given access to information considered by SIRC essential to be given in camera and ex parte, and not to be revealed to the applicant or counsel. That is simply an aspect of the arrangements possible under the rules for SIRC to determine in accord with s. 48(2) of the
CSIS Act
. What information provided to it is to be heard in camera, ex parte, and in the absence of a person affected or that person's counsel and what portion, if any, of the evidence so received may be disclosed, is clearly a matter for SIRC to determine under the
CSIS Act
. As earlier noted the general processes of SIRC, under the statute and SIRC's rules were found to be valid and not in conflict with principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
by the Supreme Court in
Chiarelli
