[39]
When these applications were heard, counsel for the applicant did not raise as an issue an allegation of infringement of s. 15 of the
Charter
, although counsel did not object to that issue being raised by CAF. The Attorney General for the respondents did object to that issue, not raised by the applicant at the hearing, being raised on the initiative of an intervenor. It was urged that no appropriate evidentiary background for the issue was laid in the submissions of the applicant, and by the terms on which CAF was granted standing as an intervenor it was not to adduce further evidence but was to take the existing record filed by the parties as the basis of its submissions. Further, counsel argued that record does not support a claim that s. 15 of the
Charter
is violated by s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
or its application in this case.
