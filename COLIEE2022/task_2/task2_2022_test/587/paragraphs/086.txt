As I understand the argument in relation to s. 2(b) of the
Charter
it is mainly based on the close and significant interdependence of freedom of expression with freedom of association. That view is advanced by the applicant. It is supported by CAF, and by CCLA which succinctly expresses its submission, in written argument, thus
"... It is submitted that to the extent associations constitute a means by which individuals express themselves - by which they define their social, political and religious values and beliefs - freedom of expression is also infringed or denied by paragraph 19(1)(g) of the
Immigration Act
."
In my opinion, the close interrelation of the two freedoms said to be in issue here does not in itself provide a basis for assessing the statutory provision in question as one infringing upon the freedom of expression separate and apart from any infringement upon freedom of association.
