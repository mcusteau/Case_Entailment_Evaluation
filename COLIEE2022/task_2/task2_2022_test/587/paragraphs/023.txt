The other matter concerned the appropriate respondent in application IMM-2197-94, where, in written submissions for the respondents in advance of the hearing it was submitted that the Attorney General of Canada was the appropriate respondent, rather than the Governor General-in-Council and the Solicitor General as named in the applicant's originating motion. Counsel for the respondents did not actively pursue this issue at the hearing and I did not invite argument upon it. I note that in both proceedings counsel for the Attorney General of Canada represented the respondents. In my opinion the written submissions of counsel for the respondent are correct in light of the usual practice of naming the Attorney General as respondent in proceedings concerning decisions of the Governor General-in-Council. By the order accompanying these reasons, the respondent in IMM-2197-94 is directed to be the Attorney General of Canada, replacing the Governor General-in-Council and the Solicitor General, and the style of cause is amended to reflect that. I note also that of its own accord this court amends the designation of one respondent and the style of cause in IMM-4557-93 by deleting the Minister of Employment and Immigration, originally named, and including instead the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, who now has responsibility for administration of the
Immigration Act
