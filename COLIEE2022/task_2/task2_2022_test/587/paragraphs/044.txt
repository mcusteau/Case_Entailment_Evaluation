In the course of its decision, SIRC accepted the opinion of the Attorney General of Canada that s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
identifies three classes of persons. For convenience I repeat the words of that paragraph.
"... persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe will engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada or are members of or are likely to participate in the unlawful activities of an organization that is likely to engage in such acts of violence."
