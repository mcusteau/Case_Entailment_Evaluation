That evidence is not referred to in the applicant's submissions that SIRC ignored, misunderstood or misstated evidence or that the tribunal erred in its findings of fact. Only in regard to the finding that the PFLP is a terrorist organization does the applicant refer to evidence provided to SIRC from CSIS officers. The arguments for the applicant are stated essentially in relation to the evidence presented by the applicant, or evidence supportive of that from witnesses called on his behalf or by SIRC itself. I agree with submissions of the applicant that SIRC's findings are to be viewed in the entire context of the evidence before it, but that context includes the evidence from CSIS as well as that from the applicant. SIRC's conclusion about the credibility of the applicant's denial of his membership in the PFLP must be seen in light of the evidence that he was indeed a member, trusted, and at a high level in the organization. The tribunal, faced with conflicting evidence on the point, found that he is a member, and his denial is not persuasive in light of the evidence presented, not in camera, including his own admissions of his close association with and his activities in support of the organization.
