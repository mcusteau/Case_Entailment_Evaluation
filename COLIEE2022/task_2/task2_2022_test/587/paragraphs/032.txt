Finally, as the applicant's counsel urges, the courts have recognized that judicial review for an order quashing the decision of an investigating body or a recommending body may be appropriate, particularly where it is urged the body is bound by a duty of fairness but has failed to meet its responsibilities. (See: Mahoney, J.A.,
Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council et al. v. National Farm Products Marketing Council
, [1986] 2 F.C. 247, at 257; 65 N.R. 392, at 398; 26 D.L.R.(4th) 677, at 685 (F.C.A.)). Here the decision and report of SIRC, made after an inquiry and an opportunity for the applicant to be heard, presents findings and a conclusion, described in the report as a recommendation, which normally the Governor-in-Council would be expected to follow. SIRC's negative decision and report with reference to an applicant can be expected to lead to adverse effects on the rights, interests, property, privileges or liberties of individuals, here of Mr. Al Yamani. In such a case, this court would have to be persuaded that it should decline to hear an application for judicial review which raises serious questions of fairness of the process, of administrative law and of the constitutional validity of SIRC's proceedings and its decision. I am not so persuaded.
