The argument of the Attorney General implicitly invites the court to "read down", or limit the interpretation of, the statutory terms in question to circumstances clearly within the competence of Parliament in light of the
Charter
. So limiting that portion of s. 19(1)(g) might meet requirements of s.Â 1 of the
Charter
, for example, by applying that provision only to circumstances found by SIRC in this case, where a permanent resident is found to be a member of a terrorist organization which is found likely to engage in acts of violence of the sort described in that paragraph. No argument was directly addressed to such an interpretation of s. 19(1)(g) by any of counsel, for the parties or the intervenors.
