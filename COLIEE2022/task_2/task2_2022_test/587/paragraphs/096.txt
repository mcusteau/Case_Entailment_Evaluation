Is the provision nevertheless saved, by reason of s. 1 of the
Charter
, as a reasonable limit "prescribed by law as ... demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society"? The applicant and CCLA submit s. 19(1)(g) cannot be saved by s. 1 since it is overly broad, with no definition of "member" and no real definition of "organization". It is possible to construe the provision, as it is here in question, to apply to a trade union, entitled under law to strike action, which at least in the past has resulted in violence that endangered the lives or safety of persons in Canada. CCLA contends the provision does not qualify as a reasonable limit prescribed by law.
