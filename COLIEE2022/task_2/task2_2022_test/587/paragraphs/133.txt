In my opinion any question that concerns alleged errors of fact, or errors of law concerning the manner in which the determinations of SIRC are related to the evidence before it are not questions of general importance; rather, they are questions of interest to the immediate parties to these applications. Thus, I do not certify questions submitted which, though important to the immediate parties, concern typical administrative law issues about the hearing of evidence and findings of fact by SIRC.
