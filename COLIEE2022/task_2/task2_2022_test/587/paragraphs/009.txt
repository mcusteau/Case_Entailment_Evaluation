He made application for Canadian citizenship in May 1988, and apparently as a result of that application he became the subject of security screening by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ("CSIS"). On April 1, 1991 he was interviewed by a CSIS officer. Subsequently he received a letter dated May 29, 1992, signed by the then Minister of Employment and Immigration and by the Solicitor General stating that pursuant to s. 39(2) of the
Act
, they had made a report to SIRC because they were of the opinion that Mr. Al Yamani is a person described in ss. 19(1)(e), 19(1)(g) and 27(1)(c) of the
Act
. I note that s. 27(1)(c) has since been repealed, and while SIRC's finding related only to part of s. 19(1)(g), the continuing relevant provisions of the
Act
, are as follows.
"19(1) No person shall be granted admission who is a member of any of the following classes:
. . . . .
(e) persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe
(i) will engage in acts of espionage or subversion against democratic government, institutions or processes, as they are understood in Canada,
(ii) will, while in Canada, engage in or instigate the subversion by force of any government,
(iii) will engage in terrorism, or
(iv) are members of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe will
(A) engage in acts of espionage or subversion against democratic government, institutions or processes, as they are understood in Canada,
(B) engage in or instigate the subversion by force of any government, or
(C) engage in terrorism.
. . . . .
(g) persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe will engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada or are members of or are likely to participate in the unlawful activities of an organization that is likely to engage in such acts of violence;
. . . . .
"39(2) Where the Minister and the Solicitor General are of the opinion, based on security or criminal intelligence reports received and considered by them, that a permanent resident is a person described in ... paragraph 19(1)(e), ... (g)... they may make a report to the Review Committee [i.e., to SIRC].
"39(3) The Minister and the Solicitor General of Canada shall, within ten days after a report referred to in subsection (2) is made, cause a notice to be sent informing the person who is the subject of the report that following an investigation in relation thereto, a deportation order may be made against that person.
. . . . .
"39(5) Where a report is made to the Review Committee pursuant to subsection (2), the Review Committee shall investigate the grounds on which it is based and for that purpose subsections 39(2) and (3) and sections 43, 44 and 48 to 51 of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service Act apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to the investigation as if the investigation were conducted in relation to a complaint made pursuant to section 42 of that Act, except that
(a) a reference in any of those provisions to 'deputy head' shall be read as a reference to the Minister and the Solicitor General of Canada; and
(b) paragraph 50(a) of that Act does not apply with respect to the person concerning whom the report is made.
"39(6) The Review Committee shall, as soon as practicable after a report is made to it pursuant to subsection (2), send to the person with respect to whom the report is made a statement summarizing such information available to it as will enable the person to be as fully informed as possible of circumstances giving rise to the report.
. . . . .
"39(9) The Review Committee shall, on completion of an investigation in relation to a report made to it pursuant to subsection (2), make a report to the Governor-in-Council containing its conclusion whether or not a certificate should be issued under subsection 40(1) and the grounds on which that conclusion is based.
"39(10) The Review Committee shall, at the same time as or after a report is made pursuant to subsection (9), provide the person with respect to whom the report is made with a report containing the conclusion referred to in that subsection.
. . . . .
"40(1) Where, after considering a report made by the Review Committee referred to in subsection 39(9), the Governor-in-Council is satisfied that the person with respect to whom the report was made is a person described in paragraph ... 19(1)(e) ... (g) ..., the Governor-in-Council may direct the Minister to issue a certificate to that effect."
