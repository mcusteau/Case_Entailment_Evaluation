[137]
I certify the following questions.
1.
Jurisdiction of this court
Does this court have jurisdiction pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
to review a report made pursuant to s. 39(9) of the
Immigration Act
or an Order-in-Council made pursuant to s. 40(1) of the latter
Act
?
Assuming the answer to question 1. is "yes", the following questions arise.
2.
Interpretation of s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
Did SIRC err in law in its interpretation of the standard of proof required, or of the meaning of the words "member" and "likely", within s. 19(1)(g) insofar as that provision relates to persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe are members of organizations likely to commit acts of violence of the sort described in the paragraph?
3.
Section 19(1)(g) and the
Charter
Does s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
, insofar as it relates to persons referred to in Question 2 (above), infringe freedoms guaranteed under ss. 2(b) and 2(d) of the
Charter
, and if it infringes either of those freedoms is that demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society within s. 1 of the
Charter
?
4. Are the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
, or at common law, violated by the procedures followed in this case in relation to:
(a) the circulation, pursuant to
SIRC Rules of Procedure
, s. 37 (or 43), of a draft report of the designated SIRC member conducting the investigation (i.e., hearing the case) to other members of SIRC for comment before a report is completed by the designated member and adopted by SIRC?
(b) the failure or refusal of SIRC to disclose to the applicant
i) any summary or other record of two witnesses who gave evidence before SIRC in the absence of the applicant and his counsel,
ii) any transcript or summary record of information or conversations obtained by electronic or other means of surveillance?
(c) the failure or refusal to provide a process for security clearance of counsel representing a person concerned in a SIRC investigation for the purpose of counsel's attendance at ex parte in camera hearings of evidence by the Committee?
(d) the failure of the Governor General-in-Council to provide opportunity for further submissions by the applicant before acting on the basis of a report received from SIRC under s. 39 of the
Act
?
(e) if any of these procedures infringe principles of fundamental justice contrary to s. 7 of the
Charter
is that infringement demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society under s. 1 of the
Charter
?
