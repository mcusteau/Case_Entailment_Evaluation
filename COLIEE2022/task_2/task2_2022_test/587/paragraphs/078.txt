In the application in file IMM-2197-94 the applicant seeks to set aside the decision of the Governor General-in-Council, and the certificate issued by the Solicitor General as directed by that decision, on alternative grounds. It is said that either the Governor General-in-Council was bound, and there was no discretion in the decision-maker, by the decision or conclusion of SIRC, so that if that conclusion were not lawful the certificate under s. 40(1) was not lawful. In the alternative, it is urged that if there was discretion in the Governor General-in-Council then the latter owed a duty in fairness to permit opportunity for submissions to be made and to consider those submissions before acting. In the latter circumstance, the principle of fairness also requires, so the applicant urges, that the Governor General's decision be supported with reasons. In response the Attorney General urges that under s. 40(1) of the
Act
the Governor General-in-Council is not bound by the report and conclusion of SIRC although, except in extraordinary cases, it is to be expected a negative conclusion by SIRC would be the basis of a decision that a certificate be issued. While the Governor General-in-Council is not free to act under s. 40(1) until after a report of SIRC, submitted under s. 39(9), has been considered, and until after the Governor General-in-Council is satisfied that the person dealt with by the report is a person described in s. 19(1)(g), the word "may" in s. 40(1) clearly means that action by the Governor General-in-Council is discretionary. Moreover, it is urged that because of the nature of the office of Governor General-in-Council the duty of fairness does not imply a requirement for a further hearing or even an opportunity for submissions before action is taken, nor does it imply an obligation to provide reasons for a decision when made.
