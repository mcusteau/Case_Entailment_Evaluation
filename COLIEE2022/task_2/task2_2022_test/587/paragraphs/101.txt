[101]
I am not persuaded the requirements of s.Â 1 are met. While no evidence of pressing need is presented, I acknowledge the state's fundamental need to protect persons against the threat of violent acts, by non citizens, that would or might endanger lives or safety of persons in this country. I am not satisfied, however, that there is a rational connection between protecting the lives and safety of persons in Canada and restricting freedom of association of permanent residents who are merely members of organizations, whatever their nature, that are likely ("susceptible") to commit acts of violence that would or might endanger lives or safety of persons in Canada. Nor am I satisfied that restricting freedom of association on the scale embraced by s. 19(1)(g) is proportional to the objective. In short, by embracing members of organizations broadly described, regardless of the individual's record or propensity to violence, or the organization's purposes, Parliament does not impair as little as possible the freedom of association of permanent residents.
