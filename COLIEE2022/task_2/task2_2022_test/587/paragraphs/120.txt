[120]
For the applicant it is urged that the form of collegial decision-making provided for under rule 37 (or 43) differs from that accepted by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Consolidated Bathurst Packaging Ltd. v. International Woodworkers of America, Local 2-69 and Labour Relations Board (Ont.)
, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 282; 105 N.R. 161; 38 O.A.C. 321; 68 D.L.R.(4th) 524; 90 C.L.LC. 14,007; 42 Admin. L.R. 1. Here the task of the SIRC member presiding at a hearing is said to be limited to a narrow investigation in relation to a report with respect to a named individual pursuant to s. 39 of the
Act
and it does not go beyond the immediate interests of the person concerned nor relate to policy considerations.
