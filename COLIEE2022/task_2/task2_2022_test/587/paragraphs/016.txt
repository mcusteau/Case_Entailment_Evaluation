The SIRC report did not decide that the applicant was a person described in ss. 19(1)(e) or then 27(1)(c) as the Ministers had alleged, but it did conclude that Mr. Al Yamani is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
for it found he was within one of three classes of persons described in that section. SIRC so reported to the Governor General-in-Council and recommended that a certificate be issued against the applicant under s. 40(1) of the
Act
. That report is the subject of the first application for judicial review, in court file IMM-4557-93. A version of the SIRC report and recommendation dated August 3, 1993 was provided to the applicant.
