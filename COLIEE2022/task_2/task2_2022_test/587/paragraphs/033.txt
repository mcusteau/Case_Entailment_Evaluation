In my view, even if the second application for judicial review had not been commenced, the first application dealing with the SIRC decision and report would have been appropriately heard within this court's jurisdiction. The second application completes opportunity for review of the process underway at the time this matter was heard. In my opinion the second proceeding does not add to or detract from the appropriate role of the court in dealing directly with issues concerning the SIRC decision as presented in the first application filed before any further steps in the process were initiated. The second application does question the validity of the decision by the Governor General-in-Council, mainly because of the same issues as arise in the first application, i.e., concerning SIRC's decision, upon which the subsequent decision was said to be based.
