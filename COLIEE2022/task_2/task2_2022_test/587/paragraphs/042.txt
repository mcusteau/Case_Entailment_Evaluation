[42]
In this case, while s. 15 of the
Charter
was briefly dealt with in written argument filed on behalf of the parties, it was not raised in submissions of the applicant at the hearing, nor responded to at the hearing by the respondents. I determine that it is not an issue raised for decision in these applications and it may not be raised by an intervenor. My determination is that CAF's standing as intervenor does not support recognition of any right or standing to raise issues that are not raised by the parties to these applications in their presentation of argument and submissions at the hearing. Thus, I make no determination on the merits of CAF's submissions concerning s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
and s. 15 of the
Charter
.
