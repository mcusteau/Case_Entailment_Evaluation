The Attorney General refers to some of the background of the legislation, in particular a briefing note prepared for the Minister in dealing with s. 19(1)(g) when it was proposed as an amendment to the
Act
in 1977. At that time objection had been raised to including "members" in the proposed provision, without requiring that an individual or "member" be one who was likely to participate in acts of violence. Government of the day maintained the proposed language despite some objection. As the briefing note states, in part,
"[The motion to amend the bill proposed] . . .Â would prevent the exclusion of
members
of terrorist organizations from Canada, so that we could stop only those terrorists individually known as such to the authorities, or persons individually known to be likely to participate in the unlawful activities of terrorist organizations.
"In the past few years, with few exceptions, most terrorist acts have been committed by persons with no previous record, but known to be members of or closely connected with organizations that commonly use terrorism as an instrument to obtain their objectives or secure publicity.
"By limiting the applicability of the clause, Mr. Duclos would deny Canadians the before-the-fact protection they deserve against the kind of wholesale massacres which took place at Lod Airport in Israel and at Munich. The Government would rightly be considered irresponsible if this protection were not given."
