The unique and significant role of SIRC in reviewing determinations affecting persons, on security grounds, in relation to employment in the public service, and in relation to matters specified under the
Immigration Act
, the
Citizenship Act
and the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, and the historic evolution of that role, is outlined for the court in the Memorandum of Argument of the intervenor SIRC. That committee is created and its authority defined under the
CSIS Act
. In this case, pursuant to s. 39(5) of the
Immigration Act
, in an investigation by SIRC following upon a joint report by the Ministers concerned, that investigation is carried on pursuant to ss. 43, 44 and 48 to 51 of the
CSIS Act
as if the investigation were conducted under s. 42 of the
CSIS Act
, which deals with complaints of public servants concerning denial of security clearance. SIRC is granted wide powers pursuant to s. 39(1) of the
CSIS Act
to adopt its own procedures and it has adopted
Rules of Procedure
for dealing with complaints or reports directed to SIRC concerning adverse determinations of security risk. Those rules were here followed. The process of SIRC was generally not contested by the applicant, except in particular respects where its procedures are in question in the issues raised by the applicant. Thus, the procedures generally are not here reviewed. Where specific procedures are questioned that is clear in the discussion of issues that follows.
