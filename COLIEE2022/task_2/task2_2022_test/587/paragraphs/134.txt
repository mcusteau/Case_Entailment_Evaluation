Counsel for CAF submitted, with support of other counsel, that a question be certified in regard to the standing of "an intervenor to raise an independent constitutional challenge not argued by either of the parties but said to be sustainable on the evidence before the court". The question, in my opinion, does not arise, and thus would be hypothetical, since, aside from my decision that an intervenor has no such standing, I have determined, albeit quite summarily, that the evidence in the record before the court does not establish a basis for argument that s.Â 15 of the
Charter
is here infringed, the issue which CAF ultimately seeks to raise if it were found to have standing to raise it.
