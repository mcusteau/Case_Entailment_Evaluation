Despite this view, the applicant submits that the issue of infringement of s. 7 of the
Charter
, in regard to deprivation of security of the person arising from probable deportation, is still an open issue. For the applicant it is said that, accepting that the general processes of the SIRC proceedings have been approved by the Supreme Court in
Chiarelli
, and are not here contested as legitimate processes to balance the public interest in security and the interest of a permanent resident in remaining in Canada, there are particular aspects of the SIRC processes in this case which violate principles of fundamental justice. In those respects the process here is said to differ from that available in the SIRC hearing in
Chiarelli
. In the alternative, if s. 7 is foreclosed as a ground for argument, it is urged those violations also contravene common law principles of fairness, of fundamental justice, regarding a fair hearing.
