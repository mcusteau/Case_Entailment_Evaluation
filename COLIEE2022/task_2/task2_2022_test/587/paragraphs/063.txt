It is submitted for the applicant that the reference to "reasonable grounds to believe" implies an objective standard against which the belief must be measured, and in meeting that standard the respondents, upon whom the burden of proof rests, are to be rigorously examined in regard to the evidence adduced to meet the statute's requirements, because the probable consequences of a negative recommendation are so serious for the permanent resident affected. Moreover, it is urged before me that the tribunal's findings of fact should be required to be based on a high degree of probability, not merely on a balance of probabilities. Thus, the Crown at a SIRC hearing should be required to establish to a high degree of probability that there are reasonable grounds to believe the applicant is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
. The argument is based upon the decision of my colleague Mr. Justice Cullen in
Smith (J.) et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 42 F.T.R. 81 (T.D.), at 97, and upon
R. v. Secretary of State for the Home Department; Ex parte Khawaja
, [1984] A.C. 74 (H.L.), per Lord Scarman at p. 113. However, as the applicant points out, Mr. Justice Denault declined to apply the same reasoning in a case similar to
Smith
, in
Farahi-Mahdavieh, Re
(1993), 63 F.T.R. 120 (T.D.), at 123, and Mr. Justice Cullen reconsidered and declined to reaffirm the position he had earlier taken in
Smith
, in
Re Mohamed Husseen Al Husseini
, unreported, file DES-8-93, December 13, 1993 (F.C.T.D.).
