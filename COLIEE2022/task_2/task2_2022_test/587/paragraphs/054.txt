It presents an extraordinary situation for the court in judicial review proceedings to review the work of a tribunal, the full record of which is not available. Yet that is the situation authorized by Parliament under the
CSIS Act
and the
SIRC Rules
made under that
Act
. In addition, in relation to the application in court file IMM-4557-93 there was filed, pursuant to s.Â 37(1) of the
Canada Evidence Act
, a certificate on behalf of CSIS objecting to release of any information from the SIRC record that was not already provided to the applicant through the SIRC process. That certificate was not questioned and evidence described in that certificate is not before the court.
