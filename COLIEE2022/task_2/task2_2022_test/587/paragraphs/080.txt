In construing ss.Â 39 and 40(1) of the
Immigration Act
, my view is that Parliament, by providing for an investigation by SIRC intended that the process of a hearing in regard to security considerations should be undertaken at the stage of the investigation by SIRC. Upon conclusion of its investigation and submission of its report to the Governor General-in-Council, in the usual case the Governor General-in-Council would be expected to accept and act upon SIRC's conclusion, at least where the Governor General-in-Council is satisfied that the person investigated is a person included in the
Act
's descriptions of those considered as presenting sufficient risk to warrant deportation. That is what happened in this case, and the Order-in-Council containing the decision of the Governor General-in-Council specifically notes the decision is based on the grounds set out in SIRC's report.
