While it may be unusual to certify a number of questions for consideration of the Court of Appeal, in my opinion the applications here raise a number of general questions warranting consideration of that court. The questions certified are considered to be determinative of an appeal in the sense that determination by the Court of Appeal that I have erred would result in different disposition of the applications here considered.
