It is otherwise, in my view, when one turns to consider the effects of that provision and s. 2(d) of the
Charter
. Section 19(1)(g) does directly restrict freedom of association, providing for persons, who are not citizens, ultimately to be excluded or to be deported from Canada, because there are reasonable grounds to believe they are members of an organization likely to engage in acts of violence of the sort described. It is the association of persons as members of the organizations described that leads to their classification for exclusion or deportation. It is not their individual records of participating in violent activities nor a determination that they are likely to participate in such activities. Rather, it is simply the fact of membership in an organization which is likely to engage in acts of described violence that is the reason for the application of s. 19(1)(g) in this case, regardless of the obligations of membership, the range of the organization's other activities, or the influence the individual may exercise in regard to the organization. Thus, for example, in this case the applicant, though active in support of the organization, by his activities served a variety of non-violent purposes of the PFLP, as the SIRC report acknowledged.
