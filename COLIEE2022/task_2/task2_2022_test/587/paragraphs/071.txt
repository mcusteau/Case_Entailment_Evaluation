In its conclusion the report states:
"In light of the evidence showing that he is a member of the PFLP, which organization could engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada, I therefore come to the conclusion that Mr. Yamani is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Immigration Act
."
In my opinion, in the context of the report as a whole, the use of the word "could" with reference to the organization reflects the French text "susceptible", but this implies more than a mere possibility rather, it reflects a capability that is apparent from the record and status of the organization as found by SIRC, to be an international terrorist group.
