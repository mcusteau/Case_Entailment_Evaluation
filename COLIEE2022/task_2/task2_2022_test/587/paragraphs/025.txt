Procedural issues are
:
1) the court's jurisdiction to consider the application for judicial review in file IMM-4557-93 pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, a matter raised by the respondents;
2) the right of CAF as an intervenor to raise an issue, in this case an issue concerning the constitutional validity of s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
in light of s. 15 of the
Charter
, where the parties to the application did not argue that issue when these applications were heard.
Administrative law issues
are:
3) whether the SIRC erred in its conclusions as a result of errors in its consideration of the evidence: the applicant alleges that SIRC's key conclusions were reached because it ignored, misinterpreted or misunderstood the evidence presented, and that on the basis of the evidence its conclusions were unreasonable;
4) whether SIRC erred in law in its application of the
Act
, in particular in applying the wrong test in regard to s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
and its interpretation of "likely" and "member" within the meaning of those words in that paragraph;
5) whether the principles of fairness or natural justice support an opportunity for a further hearing or submissions by the applicant before action by the Governor General-in-Council after receipt of a report from SIRC.
Constitutional issues
are:
6) whether s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
is invalid as in contravention of ss. 2(b) and 2(d) of the
Charter
; CAF supports the position of the applicant that both provisions of the
Charter
are here contravened; CCLA supports, with somewhat different argument, the claimed violation of s. 2(d), and these several parties submit that the contravention of each of those freedoms is not saved by s. 1 of the
Charter
;
7) whether particular SIRC processes here followed violated principles of fundamental justice contrary to s. 7 of the
Charter
in a manner not saved by s. 1 of the
Charter
, or violated the principles of fundamental justice at common law; both SIRC and CCLA have submissions on aspects of this issue, in the case of CCLA on the
Charter
aspects only.
