SIRC's reference to perceived confusion between the CDP (the Committee for a Democratic Palestine) and the PFLP is said to misunderstand or to misrepresent the evidence. I am not persuaded this demonstrates misunderstanding for the reference to the transcript is added as an illustration after the conclusion is stated that "the evidence has shown that the CDP is in fact the PFLP". It is true that there was evidence that this was not so but there was also evidence of the close relationship of the two organizations. Ultimately, even if one agrees the report misstates the evidence in describing the applicant as confusing the two organizations, that, i.e., his reported confusion, is not a factor central to its conclusion about his membership in the PFLP.
