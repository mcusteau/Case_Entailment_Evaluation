The third major concern of the applicant in relation to fundamental justice in the process followed by SIRC arises, it is said, as a result the practice followed under rule 43 of the
SIRC Rules
. In my view, that reference ought to have been to rule 37 which concerns procedure relating to reports arising from s.Â 39(2) of the
Immigration Act
, though both rules 43 and 37 provide for similar procedures and are cast in the same terms. Rule 37 provides:
"37(1) Upon completion of their investigation, the assigned members shall submit a draft report to all Committee members containing the findings of their investigation, along with a summary of the representations made to them and any other material that they considered in drafting their report.
"37(2) Any Committee member may, after considering the draft report and within a reasonable time prescribed by the Chairman, offer suggestions of an editorial or legal nature to the assigned members or suggest to the assigned members further investigation that might be conducted including a referral to the Canadian Human Rights Commission pursuant to section 49 of the Act.
"37(3) Following the expiration of the time period prescribed by the Chairman under subsection 2, the assigned members may consider the suggestions made by other Committee members in deciding whether to amend their report or conduct further investigations but it is the decision solely of the assigned members as to what is to be included in the report, which report after each Committee member has had an opportunity to make suggestions pursuant to subsection 2, shall be accepted by the Committee."
