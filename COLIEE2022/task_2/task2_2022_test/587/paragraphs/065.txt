In
Smith v. Smith et al.
, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 312; [1952] 3 D.L.R. 449, a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada concluded it was inappropriate to apply the standard for proof in criminal cases, i.e., beyond a reasonable doubt, in a civil action for divorce, and for the majority there is only one standard of proof required in all civil actions, the balance of probabilities. Though two members of the court there suggest that the standard may vary depending upon the gravity of the issue in the civil proceedings, that has not been espoused by courts generally in this country. In my opinion, there is no basis for construing the words of s. 19(1)(g) as implying any standard of proof other than the traditional standard, i.e., of a balance of probabilities, for findings required under that provision. Thus, I conclude that the SIRC report does not err by reliance on that traditional standard and not insisting on some higher standard of probability.
