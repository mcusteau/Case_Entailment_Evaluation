The SIRC report and conclusion, dated August 3, 1993, at least in the version provided to the applicant, reviews the process followed in investigating the joint report to the Committee by the Ministers concerning the applicant. The report summarized information on the hearings, the witnesses and evidence produced, and it then sets out its findings, as follows:
"Having reviewed the evidence presented and the testimony given before me, I consider that Mr. Yamani has not been truthful regarding his membership with the PFLP.
. . . . .
"Mr. Yamani did not recognize being a member of the PFLP but did admit being the closest Canadian Palestinian individual to the highest offices of the PFLP.
"Mr. Yamani occupied within the PFLP organization a position of trust that few members of such an organization can acquire. He has access to the highest echelons of the organization; he has attended their closed meetings, as well as their public meetings in the Middle East; he has been the trustee of at least one million dollars which has belonged in part to the PFLP; he has lived off the interests of the investments; he has travelled on several occasions to the U.S.A. and throughout Canada; he has been the courier of information between different PFLP groups; he has been the contact between the PFLP offices in the U.S.A. and in Damascus.
"Mr. Yamani has played an important role within the ranks of the PFLP organization and has been the key instigator of the organization in Canada. I am in agreement with the statement of the Director General of Counter-Terrorism at CSIS when he qualified Mr. Yamani as being the 'mover and shaker' of the movement.
"Mr. Yamani's behavior has shown a concern for the use of secrecy and hidden agendas. His use of counter surveillance tactics and code words demonstrates a lack of transparency essential to convey a sense of truthfulness. His justification of such behaviour is, in my opinion, unacceptable.
"The allegation of membership of the CDP is cause for concern. It is my opinion that the purpose of such allegation was to weaken the evidence showing his membership with the PFLP. The evidence heard not in-camera has shown that the CDP is in fact the PFLP.
"Even Mr. Yamani during his testimony confused both organizations: ... (quotes omitted)
"I find it difficult to believe that in light of his commitment to the PFLP and Palestinian causes, Mr. Yamani is not a member of the PFLP organization. It goes against all the evidence presented during the hearings (not heard in-camera).
"Throughout his testimony, Mr. Yamani tried to convince me that the PFLP has not been a terrorist organization since 1972. However, the evidence presented to me in the presence of Mr. Yamani shows the contrary. ... Although the objectives and methods of the PFLP may have changed throughout the years, the PFLP still remains a terrorist organization.
"The PFLP and its leader, Dr. George Habash have not renounced the use of terrorist activities; ... (quotes omitted)
"Mr. Yamani did not submit any evidence showing that the Leader of the PFLP had made on other occasions different statements or that the leader was misquoted or quoted out of context.
"'CSIS' Director General of Counter-Terrorism, Mr. R. I. MacEwan testified that it was his experience of international terrorist groups:
'that what catalysts will generate action is going to be totally unpredictable and it is going to be a reaction to events that have taken place at some point in time in some other part of the world primarily. It is not an orchestrated game plan; except in the short term, until a better option and in all fairness, a better option doesn't necessarily have to be a more ruthless option' ...
. . . . .
"Mr. MacEwan reported that although the PFLP has changed its objectives, attitude and activities, it did not diminish the real possibility of it resorting to terrorist activities in the future. He believes that:
'There is no reason to believe that they would not resort to whatever they had to do in relation to what they have identified as their legitimate targets, which includes not only Israel but the United States and western interests.' ...
"After carefully reviewing all of the evidence, I find that the PFLP is an international terrorist organization likely ('susceptible') to engage in acts of violence that would or could endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. Although it has not actively committed acts of violence in Canada, it has not publicly renounced the use of violence. There is still a possibility for the PFLP to commit acts of violence in Canada.
"Mr. Yamani has been doing non violent work for the PFLP organization in Canada on a daily basis since at least 1988. Nothing precludes the PFLP from having him perform other things in Canada. The mere presence of a Chapter Leader in name or in fact in Canada demonstrates the importance for the organization of remaining active in Canada.
Conclusion
"In light of the evidence showing that he is a member of the PFLP, which organization could engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada, I therefore come to the conclusion that Mr. Yamani is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Immigration Act
.
"Having found that Mr. Yamani is a person described in one of the three categories of s. 19(1)(g) of the
Immigration Act
, I do not find it necessary to conclude on the application of s. 19(1)(e) or on the other categories of 19(1)(g) and 27(1)(c) of the
Immigration Act
.
"I therefore recommend that a certificate be issued in accordance with s. 40(1) of the
Immigration Act
."
