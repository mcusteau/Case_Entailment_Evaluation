In my opinion s. 19(1)(g) is to be interpreted so that "likely", "susceptible", with reference to the organization referred to, means "capable of" and not simply "probable". In the result the conclusion of SIRC, which I have already determined was not unreasonable on the evidence, would be acceptable if the organization were merely judged capable of, not necessarily that it would probably be, engaging in acts of violence as described in the paragraph.
