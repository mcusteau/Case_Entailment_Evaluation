The parties differ on whether the process followed by SIRC contravenes s. 7 of the
Charter
which provides:
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
The Attorney General contends that the question has already been determined in effect, by the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
Chiarelli
, supra, and by the Court of Appeal in the subsequent case of
Canepa v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 3 F.C. 270; 145 N.R. 121; 93 D.L.R.(4th) 589; 10 C.R.R.(2d) 348 (F.C.A.). In
Chiarelli
, the court was concerned in part with the process of a SIRC investigation of a report by the Minister of Employment and Immigration and by the Solicitor General that the applicant, a permanent resident, was a person within a class of persons who had committed serious criminal offenses for which a certificate should issue as a basis for deportation. The process there followed in the SIRC investigation was analogous to that in the case at bar except for certain aspects. In
Canepa
the Court of Appeal was concerned with an appeal from a dismissal by the Immigration Appeal Board of an appeal against a deportation order issued to a permanent resident who was certified as a person described with a criminal record warranting deportation under the
Act
. In the latter case, Mr. Justice MacGuigan, speaking of the court declining to hear argument based on alleged violation of s. 7 of the
Charter
, said the following, at [1992] 3 F.C. 277-281:
"The Supreme Court [in
Chiarelli
] has ... squarely decided that the qualifications on the right of permanent residents to remain in Canada which Parliament has imposed in the classes of s. 27(1) of the
Act
do not contravene the fundamental principles of justice in s. 7.
"Moreover, although the Supreme Court, in deciding the issue on the basis of fundamental justice, left open the question whether deportation for serious offenses can be conceptualized as a deprivation of liberty under s. 7, this court has already decided that it cannot, and is bound by its previous decisions:
Hoang v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)
(1990), 13 Imm. L.R.(2d) 35;
Hurd v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1989] 2 F.C. 594.
"In our view at the hearing, therefore, arguments as to a violation of s. 7 were precluded by authority."
