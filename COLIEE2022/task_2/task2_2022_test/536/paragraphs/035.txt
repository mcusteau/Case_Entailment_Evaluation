Justice Romilly accepts the view that in order for a meeting to be duly convened, it must actually be held and attended by a quorum of Council members. In the NHCN
Election Procedures Act
, article 9.1(e) uses the term duly constituted as opposed to duly convened. However, I believe those two terms are interchangeable in the context of the present matter. I understand that article 11.1 of the NHCN
Guidelines
mandates that Band Council meetings be held on the first and third Tuesday of every month. However, if a meeting does not actually take place, or takes place but is not attended by a quorum of Council members, I find that it cannot be considered duly constituted as required by article 9.1(e). As such, I do not agree with the applicant's suggestion that all the councillors have vacated their position because they failed to attend three consecutive duly constituted meetings.
