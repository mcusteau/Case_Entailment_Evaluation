The jurisprudence has established that an Indian Band Council constitutes a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" pursuant to section 18 of the
Act
(
Rider v. Ear
(1979), 103 D.L.R.(3d) 168 (Alta. T.D.), and
Gabriel v. Canatonquin
, [1978] 1 F.C. 124 (T.D.)). As such, the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed in
Wanderingspirit et al. v. Marie et al.
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1538; 312 N.R. 385 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 18, that this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of quo warranto or to grant declaratory relief against an Indian Band Council and its constituent members:
"Pursuant to paragraph 18(1)(a) of the
Federal Court Act
, the Federal Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of quo warranto or to grant declaratory relief. I see no reason why declaratory relief which, in substance, is in the nature of quo warranto, cannot be granted. That procedure appears to have been approved in
Lake Babine Indian Band et al. v. Williams et al.
(1996), 194 N.R. 44 (F.C.A.). Robertson, J.A., states at paragraphs 3 and 4:
'[3] It is to be noted at the outset that the appellants do not dispute the jurisdiction of the court to address the issues herein. The respondents seek declaratory and injunctive relief, which in these circumstances essentially amounts to a request for a writ of quo warranto. Quo warranto allows a challenge of an individual's right to hold a particular office ...
'[4] There is no doubt therefore that there is jurisdiction per se, an Indian Band Council being a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" within the meaning of ss. 2 and 18 of the
Act
. ... Accordingly, this Court has jurisdiction to address the issue but it can do so only in the context of a s. 18 application not the context of an action initiated by way of statement of claim.'"
