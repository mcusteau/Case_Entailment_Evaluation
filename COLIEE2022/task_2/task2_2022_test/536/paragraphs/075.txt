Counsel for Mr. Apetagon provided no written submissions but nevertheless, commented on his client's attitude at Council meetings. The respondent Apetagon demonstrated that he was mostly supportive of the applicant but was regularly outnumbered. His counsel suggests that he is somewhat between a rock and a hard place. That is, he supported the respondents' position that Council members did not vacate their positions, but also abstained on resolution No. N.H./2003-04#128 of March 17, 2004, regarding the mandate for an injunction. Regarding the resolution passed on December 2, 2003, to "ratify" the unilateral decision taken by the Chief on July 23, 2003, it is not clear whether he voted against or abstained. Nevertheless, it seems that the respondent Apetagon has not demonstrated the same bad faith attitude towards the applicant and often supported him.
