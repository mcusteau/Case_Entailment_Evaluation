The fundamental question regarding the issue of vacancy is what qualifies as a duly constituted meeting. There is no definition of the aforementioned term in the
Indian Act
or in the NHCN
Guidelines
. In
Assu
, above, Justice Romilly, at paragraph 37, acknowledges that the notion of what constitutes a duly convened meeting is somewhat vague:
"There is very little authority as to what constitutes a 'duly convened meeting', as the term is undefined in both the
Indian Act
and the
Indian Band Procedure Regulations
(the
Regulations
). However, the
Regulations
do contain some relevant provisions, the most important of which is the requirement that an actual meeting be held at which a quorum of Council members is present. Where a Council consists of nine or more members, s. 6 of the
Regulations
states that a quorum shall consist of 5 members:
