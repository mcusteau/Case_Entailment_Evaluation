Members of the Band have no obligation whatsoever to support each other; they are free to discuss and to vote. Nonetheless, when members vote in bad faith, as was the case when councillor Muswagon moved the resolution on December 2, 2004, to ratify the decision of Chief Evans, on the basis that the applicant should somehow be punished for not wanting to conform with the majority, such a course of action is contrary to the rules and the principles of democracy.
