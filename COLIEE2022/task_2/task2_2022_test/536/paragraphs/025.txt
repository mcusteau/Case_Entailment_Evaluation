The respondents further mention that the applicant had approached a representative of the Minister regarding similar concerns found in the present matter. The applicant had requested that the redress mechanisms found in the Canadian First Nations Funding Agreement (CFNFA) between Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) and the NHCN be used to remedy the disputes. Those disputes related to the failure of the NHCN Council to adhere to its own operating procedures and the issues surrounding the applicant's salary and expense budget (see email sent from Mr. Martin Egan (Minister's representative) to Marcel Luke Hertlein Balfour, dated November 25, 2003, page 316 of the respondent's record - volume III).
