The respondents argue that this Court does not have jurisdiction in the present matter. As such, they submit that judicial review is not available to the applicant and claim that the request for a declaration in the nature of a writ of quo warranto is not warranted. Considering that the present matter was case managed and that the respondents consented to the notice of application as it was before Prothonotary Tabib, I am somewhat reluctant to address the issue of jurisdiction. The respondents had ample opportunity to tackle this issue at an earlier time and I consider it suspect that they failed to do so. With that being said, I will continue with my analysis.
