The applicant takes issue with the "Band custom" justification for the creation of a sub-group that does not have to follow NHCN
Guidelines
. The applicant contends that elected band officials have neglected their fiduciary and representative duties. The applicant further submits that the respondents did not provide any evidence that the custom of the NHCN Band has somehow properly and validly been changed to forego providing notice of meetings or the recording of minutes. Also no evidence was submitted to illustrate that Band councillors were to be excluded from participating in NHCN decision-making. Finally, the applicant submits that even if the custom changed, such a change would be disallowed for being contrary to the mandatory requirements pursuant to paragraph 2(3)(b) of the
Indian Act
which states the following.
"b) a power conferred on the council of a band shall be deemed not to be exercised unless it is exercised pursuant to the consent of a majority of the councillors of the band present at a meeting of the council duly convened."
