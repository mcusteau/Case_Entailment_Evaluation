The applicant claims that his honorarium and expense payments were unjustly curtailed or withheld. The applicant was often in disagreement with other Band Council members regarding NHCN matters. He also wrote letters that were critical of Band Council procedures and decisions. The respondents admitted that the applicant's honorarium was reduced for purportedly acting to discredit the efforts made by the Chief and Band Council. Chief Evans reduced unilaterally the applicant's honorarium from $60,000 to $5,000 and also denied him the use of his travel budget which was in the amount of $24,000. The applicant was informed by letter dated July 23, 2003, that his duties and responsibilities were being stripped and his salary reduced. Although immediately implemented the aforementioned course of action taken against the applicant was not formally adopted by a duly convened Council meeting until December 2, 2003. Chief Evans usurped his power by unilaterally stripping the applicant of his responsibilities and honorarium. Further, Chief Evans attempted to formalize his usurpation of power by having his actions sanctioned at a duly convened meeting four months after the applicant began to be denied his portfolios and honorarium. No notification or opportunity was provided to the applicant to respond to the disciplinary actions taken against him regarding the reduction in his salary and duties. Further, once the applicant commenced the present judicial matter before this Court, he was locked out of the Council building and his computer was seized.
