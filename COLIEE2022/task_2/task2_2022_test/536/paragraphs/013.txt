In
Assu et al. v. Chikite et al.
, [1998] B.C.T.C. Uned. H07; [1999] 1 C.N.L.R. 14 (S.C.), Justice Romilly of the British Columbia Supreme Court, discussed the source and the extent of a Band Council's power as it is outlined in the law. He said the following at paragraph 30:
"The
Act
expressly confers a number of powers on Band Councils. The courts have made it clear that, as an autonomous elected body, a Council is entitled to make decisions as it sees fit on the matters falling within the scope of its powers, provided that the decisions are informed and are reached by majority vote at duly convened meetings. [...] It is now generally accepted that a Council holds not only all of these express powers, but also all additional powers necessary to effectively carry out its statutory responsibilities, including the power to bring or defend claims on behalf of the Band [...] It would therefore appear that the Band is bound by the decisions of its elected Council unless they act in bad faith."
