If the Chief had the ability to cancel and reschedule meetings at will, then he could manipulate the timing of meetings in favour of his own agenda. For example, situations could arise whereby councillors that favour the Chief's positions will be absent from a meeting in which a vote will be taken on a particular matter, leaving only those who oppose him. If the Chief knows this in advance, and cancels the meeting accordingly, he is manipulating the system in order to favour his agenda. Such a scenario is contrary to the notion of democracy and is in violation of the fiduciary obligation the Chief holds towards his Band members and the promotion of their interests.
