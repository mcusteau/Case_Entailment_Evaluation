The wording of section 11.1 of the NHCN
Guidelines
seems to be clear regarding the frequency of meetings and who must attend. Equally clear is the wording of section 11.4 of said
Regulations
which outlines the procedure for having special Council meetings. In the present matter, the procedures outlined in sections 11.1 and 11.4 have not been respected. The NHCN Band Council has taken the position that the Chief and his three supporters decide when meetings will be convened. It is quite obvious upon review of the evidence that meetings are convened when the Chief and his three supporters are available. Such a strategy is taken in order to guarantee that a specific policy agenda is adhered to. If it is evident that dissenting councillors will outnumber those favouring the position of the Chief at a scheduled meeting, the meeting is often cancelled. Further, sometimes the meetings take place in Winnipeg, which is several hours away from where they should ordinarily be held. Such conduct is contrary to the wording and spirit of the NHCN
Guidelines
