In
Louie v. Derrickson
, [1993] B.C.J. No. 1338 (S.C.), Justice Blair, at paragraph 87, makes reference to the comments of Justice Rae in
Leonard v. Gottfriedson
(1980), 21 B.C.L.R. 326 (S.C.), regarding the need to respect the requirements of subsection 2(3) of the
Indian Act
when a Band Council exercises its powers:
"In
Leonard v. Gottfriedson
Mr. Justice Rae, commenting on a band council resolution of the Kamloops Indian Band, stated at page 337:
'The
[Indian] Act
is clearly of a tenor indicating the need and intent to benefit and protect the Indian bands and their individual members coming under its provisions.
'It is to be read, interpreted and applied in that light. Just as the exercise of a power by a municipality is required to be exercised in strict accord with the statute to protect the interests of the inhabitants, so, it seems to me, and on the same principle, the council's powers under the
Indian Act
are to be exercised strictly in accord with the
Act
in the interests of the benefit and protection of the Indians.'
"In order to satisfy the strict compliance test referred to by Mr. Justice Rae, I must be satisfied that the Band council's powers determining the severance and the payment for it were exercised in accordance with s. 2(3) of the
Indian Act
."
