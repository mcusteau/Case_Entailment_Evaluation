The second event I would like to mention concerns the attempted blackmail of the applicant. The applicant was often in disagreement with other Band Council members regarding NHCN matters. As such, he wrote letters that were critical of Band Council procedures and decisions. In a letter dated July 23, 2003, Chief Evans informed the applicant that he was unilaterally removing the latter's portfolios and reducing his honorarium (see applicant's record volume II at pages 27 and Tab 18). The respondent Muswagon, as noted in the minutes of a regular Council meeting dated December 2, 2003, acknowledged that the applicant's honorarium was reduced for purportedly acting to discredit the efforts made by the Chief and Band Council. In the said meeting, a motion was passed to ratify the decision taken by Chief Evans to reduce the applicant's honorarium for not complying with the wishes of Council. It was made clear to the applicant that such a decision could have been reversed if he had just complied with the Chief's wishes and was not openly critical of the Band Council's actions (see the minutes of the NHCN Band Council meeting at page 15, Tab M of the applicant's record, volume III). This is a clear indication of influence peddling and blackmail directed towards the applicant. Such behaviour is deplorable and has no place in democratic institutions, which the NHCN Band Council purports to be.
