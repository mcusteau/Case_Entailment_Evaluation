On or about March 17, 2004, three members of the sub-group of the NHCN councillors signed a resolution directing their solicitor to pursue a claim against Don Godwin for misrepresentation and sought an injunction against him. On March 22, 2004, the aforementioned resolution, called NHCN BCR form N.H./2003-04 #128, was submitted by NHCN Band Council into the Court of Queen's Bench in Thompson, Manitoba, as evidence of an official decision of the respondent Band Council. However, that resolution which was drafted by the sub-group was never ratified by the Band Council before it was submitted to Court. The resolution was eventually ratified at a duly convened special Council meeting dated April 1, 2004, after the injunction was allowed.
