[8]
The applicant is paid a councillor's honorarium of $60,000 per year. After initiating the present judicial review proceedings, two of the applicant's honorarium remuneration payments were withheld. The subsequent honorarium remuneration payments were reduced to about $189 every two weeks, or about $5,000 per year.
ISSUES
1. Does the Federal Court have jurisdiction in the present matter?
2. Have the elected Chief and all councillors vacated their positions?
3. Should the sub-group of Band councillors be allowed to exist?
4. Should the Band Council Resolution dated March 17, 2004 be declared void?
5. Should the applicant's honorarium be changed?
