The respondents submit that the applicant should have commenced an application to judicially review the Minister's decision as opposed to commencing an application requesting a declaration in the nature of a writ of quo warranto in this Court. The respondents justify such a response by citing
Charles et al. v. Cook et al.
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 45; 140 F.T.R. 300 (T.D.), whereby Justice Rouleau found that the proceeding was premature because the avenues of appeal had not been exhausted. In the aforementioned case, the eleven members of the Semiahmoo Band used the appeal procedures contained in section 12 of the
Indian Band Election Regulations
to file an appeal alleging that the election was unfair and had been conducted unlawfully. However, the Minister dismissed the applicants' appeal and decided that the results of the election would stand. As such, the Band members should have appealed the Minister's decision.
