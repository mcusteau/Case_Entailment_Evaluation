In the covering letter submitted with the application, the applicant's representative specifically requested that the applicant be assessed in the following occupations:
CCDO: 1179-140, Travel Agent, and
CCDO: 1179-139, Tour Operator
In the letter rejecting his application, the visa officer states: "I have assessed your application based on the requirements for Travel Agent" and she then sets out the points assigned to the assessment in that occupation. The points assigned were insufficient for approval of his application. The letter goes on to set out that the officer also assessed this application against the job descriptions contained in the NOC, the National Occupational Classification system which was introduced on May 1, 1997, after his application had been filed. The agent then sets out "The occupation for which you are qualified is Travel Agent, NOC code 6431. Unfortunately, assessed in this occupation, you would not received [sic] the required number of units of assessment".
