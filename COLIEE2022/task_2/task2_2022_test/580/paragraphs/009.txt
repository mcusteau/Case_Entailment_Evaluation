[9]
In the case at bar, the applicant specifically requested that he be assessed in relation to two occupations. In the letter rejecting his application, only one of those was addressed by the visa officer and there is no evidence except for the later affidavit of the visa officer that the applicant was in fact assessed in relation to the occupation Tour Operator for which he had specifically requested assessment. The visa officer has a duty to assess an applicant for permanent residence in the occupations for which he requests assessment and the results of that assessment are to be set out, in any letter rejecting the application, for one or more occupations for which the applicant requests assessment.
