In this appeal, the Applicant complains that the citizenship judge should have applied the test for "residence in Canada" for the purpose of the Act as described by Justice Barbara Reed in Re Koo, [1993] 1 F.C. 286, at para. 10, as being the place where an applicant "regularly, normally or customarily lives", which I shall refer to as the "normally resident" test. The Applicant complains that the citizenship judge instead either applied the physical presence test of residence or blended the two tests. The Respondent argues that the citizenship judge chose to use the physical presence test and applied it correctly.
