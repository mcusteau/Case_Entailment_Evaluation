If the citizenship judge intended to use the physical presence test, which I believe she did, she could have finished her analysis with the first two sentences of that paragraph. But the last sentence is questionable. I am not aware of any clear authority for declaring 40 days to be a "minor shortage" so that the citizenship judge can "overlook the requirement of the Citizenship Act." If one is applying the physical presence test of residence, it seems to me that it requires such presence in Canada for a total of 1095 days. (Only the "normally resident" interpretation of the "residence" requirement in the Act permits actual presence in Canada for less than the three years.) But even if I am right in this, and the citizenship judge misstated the law and applied it thus, it could not have worked to the disadvantage of the Applicant. If the citizenship judge concluded he was not physically present for 1055 days, he could not have been found to be present for 1095 days. A close reading of the decision makes it clear that, in substance, the citizenship judge was not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the Applicant had been physically present in Canada 1055 days during the relevant period, as he asserted. Under the heading "Does the applicant demonstrate an ongoing physical presence in Canada?" [emphasis added] she noted that he had not produced the passport applicable during part of the period in question She went on to say:
Without this missing passport Mr. Farshchi is required to provide concrete substantial evidence of an ongoing physical presence in Canada.
She proceeded to review the evidence as to whether it showed a "continuing presence" or "continued presence" in Canada. I am unable to say that her conclusion is unreasonable. There were, in my view, good grounds for doubting the Applicant's assertion that he had been in Canada virtually all of the time covered by his first passport, a passport which he could not produce, whereas during the relevant period covered by his current passport it showed he had been absent from Canada 53% of the time. The citizenship judge was certainly entitled to find the other evidence submitted to prove presence in Canada to be inconclusive. I see no indication of her having applied an evidentiary burden other than the balance of probabilities.
