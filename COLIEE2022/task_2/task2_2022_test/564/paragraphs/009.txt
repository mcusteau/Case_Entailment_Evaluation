The Applicant contended that the citizenship judge was obliged to apply the test of normally resident as described in Koo. It appears to me that, since the decision of this Court in Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 410, the predominant view of this Court has been that a citizenship judge has the choice of which test to apply but, having chosen one, must apply it consistently. I adhere to this extensive jurisprudence although I am aware that there are now some suggestions to the contrary in recent decisions.
