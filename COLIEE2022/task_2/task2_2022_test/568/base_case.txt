Denault, J.
[Translation]: The Minister of Transport and the Attorney General of Canada, respectively respondent and mis-en-cause, are seeking an order striking out the applicant's originating motion or, in the alternative, a stay of proceedings pursuant to paragraph 50(1)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
.
[2]
In his originating motion, the appellant Bruno Gauthier seeks in effect to quash a decision by a member of the Civil Aviation Tribunal rendered on June 26, 1995 refusing to allow an appeal to dismiss a notice of suspension. Through their motion, the respondent and mis-en-cause seek to have this originating motion struck out, relying on rules 5 and 419(a), (b) and (f) of the
Rules
of this court or, in the alternative, to have the proceedings stayed until a final determination by the Civil Aviation Tribunal (hereinafter "the Tribunal") of the validity of the Minister's decision to suspend the applicant's mechanic's licence.
[3]
It is not possible, within the context of such a motion, to strike out the originating motion filed with the Registry of this court by the applicant on July 24, 1995. After some wavering in the cases, it is now established, since the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Bull (David) Laboratories (Canada) Inc. v. Pharmacia Inc. et al.
(1994), 176 N.R. 48, that rule 419 cannot be used to quash an originating motion. The Court of Appeal held at p. 52 that:
"the direct and proper way to contest an originating notice of motion which the respondent thinks to be without merit is to appear and argue at the hearing of the motion itself."
It is true that the court qualified its statement to some degree by declining to state that there is "no jurisdiction in this court either inherent or through rule 5 by analogy to other rules, to dismiss in summary manner a notice of motion which is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success". However, I think that in the case at bar the record discloses no exceptional circumstance that would entitle this court to strike out the originating motion at this stage of the proceedings. This part of the application by the respondent and the mis-en-cause is therefore premature; only at the hearing of the originating motion may the respondent and the mis-en-cause request that it be struck out.
[4]
However, I think the scheme of the
Aeronautics Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-2, justifies, in the interest of justice, the staying of the proceedings on this application for judicial review of an interlocutory decision by a member of the Civil Aviation Tribunal. It is apparent from the record that the purpose of this application is to quash a decision rendered by the Tribunal on an interlocutory motion, before the applicant has exhausted the means accorded to him by the
Aeronautics Act
. Insofar as Parliament has provided a process by which to challenge a decision of a Minister who decides to suspend a Canadian aviation document where a person affected has contravened the
Aeronautics Act
, this process should be pursued to its culmination. The decision rendered on appeal by the Tribunal is then final and binding (section 37(9) of the
Aeronautics Act
). It is well-known that a court, as a general rule, will decline to exercise its power of intervention when there is another remedy in a lower court or tribunal bearing on the same decision (
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED;
Stewart Lake Airways Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Transport)
(1995), 93 F.T.R. 186 (T.D.), per MacKay, J.).
[5]
Counsel for the applicant Gauthier submitted, in opposition to the staying of his originating motion, that the decision he is challenging is already a final decision of the Civil Aviation Tribunal that cannot be amended or revised during the appeals process. I do not have to decide this question at this stage of the proceedings. On the contrary, I think it is within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to consider the issue within the very broad framework of section 6.9(8) of the
Aeronautics Act
. In any event, the mere staying of the proceedings will allow this issue to be raised eventually at the hearing, if necessary, of the originating motion.
[6]
For these reasons, the court:
Dismisses
as premature the application to strike out the originating motion filed by the applicant on July 24, 1995 subject to its being argued at the hearing of the originating motion;
Stays
the proceedings on the originating motion until the final determination by the Civil Aviation Tribunal of the validity of the Minister's decision to suspend the applicant's mechanic's licence;
In any event,
Extends
the time accorded to the respondent to produce the "respondent's record"; this record should be filed within thirty days of the final decision of the Civil Aviation Tribunal.
Order accordingly.
