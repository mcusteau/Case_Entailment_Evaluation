I am not prepared to conclude at this stage that Mr. Lang's decision is not that of a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" within the meaning of s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
. At first sight the disputed decision was made by the respondent Lang pursuant to a power vested in him under a federal statute, here ss. 2(3) and 5(2) of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act
("the
R.C.M.P. Act
") and is as such subject to this court's power of review. [See footnote 1]
