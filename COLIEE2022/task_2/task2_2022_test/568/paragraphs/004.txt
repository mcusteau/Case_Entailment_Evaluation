However, I must also note that the disputed decision is part of a grievance process provided for by the
Act
(s. 31 of the
R.C.M.P. Act
), which has not yet been concluded. It is well-established that, as a general rule, a court will refuse to exercise its power of intervention when some other remedy exists before a lower tribunal in respect of the same decision. In the case at bar the grievance process will, under s. 32(1) of the
R.C.M.P. Act
, lead to a decision by the Commissioner, which will be final and executory subject to the judicial review provided for in the
Federal Court Act
.
