This means that ultimately the disputed decision, if upheld by the various levels of review and by the Commissioner, could be subject to review by this court. However, the applicant is seeking review at once, because he says he is in a position to know beforehand what the final result will be, and is asking to be reinstated in the meantime. He characterized the internal grievance procedure as a "phony" procedure which could not lead to a decision favourable to him and would disregard the applicable law. That is a sweeping allegation. In any case, the applicant alleged on oath facts which, if they were to be established, might support such an allegation. I note in particular, but not exclusively, the allegation that the applicant's union activity in the R.C.M.P. had a definite influence on the decision to transfer him. By analogy to the rules developed by the courts pursuant to rule 419, the facts alleged by the applicant must be taken as proven on a motion to dismiss, and assuming them to have been proven it seems clear to me the applicant is entitled to his remedy.
