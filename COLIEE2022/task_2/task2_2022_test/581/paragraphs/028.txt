I do not agree with Mr. Moin’s submissions, essentially for two reasons. First of all, they seem to overlook the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision in Hassan v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (1993), 151 N.R. 215. In that case, the Court held that section 68 of the former Immigration Act, which authorized the Board to take notice of “any other generally recognized facts and any information or opinion that is within its specialized knowledge”, clearly extended to standard country file information. The same provision is now reflected in s. 170(i) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the IRPA).
