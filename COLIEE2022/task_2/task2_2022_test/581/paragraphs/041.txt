It is well established that for a litigant to raise an issue of bias, it must be done at the first reasonable opportunity. The reasons for this rule are obvious. First of all, it is consistent with the seriousness of the allegation to require that it be raised almost immediately. Secondly, it is meant to ensure the bona fides of the claim by preventing the litigant from raising it after having received a negative decision. Thirdly, it allows the decision maker against whom the allegation is made to address it in a timely fashion. In the case at bar, none of these rationales militates against letting Mr. Moin argue an apprehension of bias.
