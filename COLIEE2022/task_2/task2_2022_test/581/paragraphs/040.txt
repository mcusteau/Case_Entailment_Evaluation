In the context of this case, I am not prepared to hold that Mr. Moin waived his right to argue bias by failing to make a motion for refusal at the hearing. Unlike most Board hearings, this one was adjourned so the Board member could find official NAB documentation and compare it with the letters in Mr. Moin’s record. In a letter to the Board dated January 25, 2006, a few days after the hearing, counsel for the applicant wrote:
Further to our discussions regarding the integrity of the NAB Inquiry documents that the claimant submitted, I would appreciate if you could provide any and all information you receive regarding the appropriate letterhead for such documents. The issue arose during the hearing that the NAB Inquiry documents did not have any letterhead. The Board Member advised me of her concern about the authenticity and integrity of the document and stated that 99% of documents received from Pakistan are fraudulent. I would also appreciate if you could provide the information or documentation regarding the Board Member’s conclusion that 99% of documents from Pakistan are fraudulent. I believe this would be highly beneficial to the claimant in seeking to rebut the statements that 99% of documents from Pakistan are fraudulent. I fear that such a statement, absent independent evidence of such a statistic, could raise an apprehension of bias regarding the applicant’s credibility and evidence. Independent evidence of this statistic would lay all fears to rest.
