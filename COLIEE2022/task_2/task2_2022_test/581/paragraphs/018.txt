[18]
In his written submissions to the Board dated June 6, 2006, counsel for Mr. Moin made the following observation:
11. It is lastly submitted that a reasonable apprehension of bias has been raised by the Board Member’s statements at the hearing that 99% of documents from Pakistan are fraudulent. The context of this statement is significant in that the Board Member, towards the conclusion of the hearing, questioned the integrity of the summons from the NAB to the Claimant requesting his attendance at the NAB office. The Board Member noted that the documents did not have any official NAB letterhead. The Claimant testified that such documents do not have official NAB letterhead since they were generated by a lower ranking officer and that only senior officers use official letterhead. Counsel for the Claimant inquired if the Board Member had any official NAB letterhead against which to compare the Claimant’s documents. The Board Member stated that she was not aware of NAB letterhead but that 99% of documents from Pakistan were fraudulent. It is respectfully submitted that statement that 99% of documents from Pakistan demonstrates a reasonable apprehension of bias and a presumption that the documents presented must be fraudulent. Given the significant nature of the documents in question and the centrality that they play in the foundation for the Claimant’s claim for refugee protection, it is respectfully submitted that a reasonable apprehension of bias has been raised.
