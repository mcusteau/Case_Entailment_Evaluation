According to s. 8(1) of the Privacy Act, the person who provides the government with personal information must consent for the government to subsequently disclose the information. S. 8(2) then lists exceptions to that general rule. One of those exceptions, at paragraph 8(2)(a), allows the government to disclose information so long as the act of disclosure is for the same purpose, or one consistent with, the purpose of originally collecting the information.
