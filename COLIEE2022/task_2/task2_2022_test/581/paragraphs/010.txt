In March 2002, Mr. Moin and his wife left Pakistan for an extended visit to see their three children living in the U.S. and Canada. When his wife returned home in March 2003, she was told by the servants that two jeeps full of armed military personnel had come shortly before to enquire about him. When opening the family’s mail, she found a letter from Pakistan’s National Accountability Bureau (NAB). The letter said the NAB had opened an inquiry against Mr. Moin, and instructed him to report to them in Karachi. Mr. Moin claims it was virtually the same notice he was sent in October 1992, when the government had opened a criminal investigation against him as revenge for pursuing Mr. Marwat as a suspect.
