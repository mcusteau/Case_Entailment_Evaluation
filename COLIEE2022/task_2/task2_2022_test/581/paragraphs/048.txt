For all of these reasons, I would allow Mr. Moin’s application for judicial review, quash the Board’s decision, and remit the matter to a different officer for redetermination. Both the applicant and the respondent proposed a question for certification, the first having to do with the appropriate timing to raise an issue of bias and the second related to the issue of specialized knowledge. Considering that the applicable principles on both of these questions are well known and that the final disposition of this case does not turn on either of these questions, I do not think it is appropriate to certify any of these questions.
