Mr. Moin’s lawyer discussed the issue with the Board member. The Board decided to adjourn the hearing so it could compare Mr. Moin’s letters with other NAB letters, to see if the letterhead (or lack thereof) on Mr. Moin’s documents was a sign of fraud. In reply to an inquiry from Mr. Moin’s counsel regarding the basis of this comment, the Refugee Protection Officer (RPO) replied in a letter dated April 21, 2006 (while the case was still adjourned):
The Presiding Member has also directed me to advise you that any comments she may have made with regard to the authenticity and integrity of the documents from Pakistan would have been based on documentary evidence, particularly Response to Information Request PAK42535.E dated 18 June 2004 and PAK34163.EX dated 30 June 2000, and that you may address this issue in your submissions.
