On May 16, 2006, the RPO communicated his observations to the Board member and counsel for Mr. Moin, writing the following about the authenticity of the alleged NAB documents:
It appeared that the Panel had some concern with regard to the authenticity of the NAB documents, because they were not on an official letterhead. Claimant stated the stationary depended on the rank of the officer signing the document. There is no evidence before the panel to indicate what type of stationery was used by NAB. There are other official documents provided by the claimant that are too typed on ordinary sheets of paper. The Panel may not reject these documents merely because the type of stationary used.
