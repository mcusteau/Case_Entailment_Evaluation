It is no doubt true that the extent of the Board’s specialized knowledge has been vastly expanded by the ease with which all sorts of documents and information can be obtained, especially with the advent of the Internet.

The information upon which the Board intends to rely, however vast its specialized knowledge may be, must still be put to the applicant. As a result, I see no need to diverge from the Court’s reasoning in Hassan, above.
