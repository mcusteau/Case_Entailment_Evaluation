In November 1991, a woman named Farana, or Veena, Hayat was raped by a number of masked men. She claimed Irfanullah Marwat, a senior politician, orchestrated the attack. Ms. Hayat came from a political family, and alleged the attack was designed to make her sign statements incriminating Mr. Marwatâ€™s enemies. The case became a major scandal, and Mr. Moin says he was placed in charge of investigating the file.
