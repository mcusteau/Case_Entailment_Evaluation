In the present case, the purpose for which Mr. Moinâ€™s personal information was collected may be expressed as general immigration purposes or, more specifically, as admissibility and refugee determination purposes. Under either interpretation, using the information to determine whether Mr. Moin might be excluded from Convention refugee status was a reflection of the same purpose or, in the alternative, a purpose consistent with that which originally justified the collection: Rahman v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 2041 (F.C.T.D.) (QL).
