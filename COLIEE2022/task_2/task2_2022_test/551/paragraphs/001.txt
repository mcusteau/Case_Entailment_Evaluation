Simpson, J.
: In the context of the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the defendant's counsel, who was retained on the eve of the motion, raised a question about this court's jurisdiction. Since the issue of jurisdiction could be dispositive of the motion for summary judgment, I adjourned the motion in order to hear argument about jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.
