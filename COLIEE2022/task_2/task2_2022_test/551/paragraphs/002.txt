The plaintiff is the inventor of a Zebra Mussel Descaler (the "Invention"). In an agreement dated June 25, 1992 (the "Assignment") he assigned the patent for the Invention (the "Patent") to the defendant company. It was to market the Invention and, if it failed to market it in a progressive and diligent manner, the plaintiff had the option, after two years, to require the defendant to reassign the patent.
