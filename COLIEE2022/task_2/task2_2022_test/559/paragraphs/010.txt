He turned, in particular, to an incident where right-wing groups subjected homosexuals to physical abuse during a gay pride parade and the reaction to it by the Prime Minister of Hungary denouncing the acts.

For the officer, this was evidence that the government is making serious efforts to combat discrimination despite the fact that "discrimination against homosexuals continues to be a concern in Hungary".
