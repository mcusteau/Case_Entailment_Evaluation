Teitelbaum, D.J.
: This is an application pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection
Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the
Act
) for judicial review of a decision by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer (the officer), dated October 10, 2008 rejecting the applicant's PRRA application. The PRRA officer found that there is less than a mere possibility that the applicant faces persecution if he were returned to Hungary, his country of origin, as described under section 96 of the
Act
, and that it was not likely that he would face a risk of torture, risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment within the contemplation of subsection 97(1) of the
Act
.
