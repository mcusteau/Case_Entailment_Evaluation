In my view, the officer's finding of fact was unreasonable and did not adequately focus on the issue of personal risk for the applicant in returning to Hungary with this very serious medical condition. The applicant's evidence pointed to a personal risk based on discrimination documented in various sources. The applicant's evidence of risk was not focused on the availability of medical treatment in Hungary but ratheron the fact that the availability of medical treatment and employment would be compromised, being a gay HIV-positive Roma.
