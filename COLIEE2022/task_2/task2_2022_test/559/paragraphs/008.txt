In relation to evidence that Hungary lacks medical treatment for persons diagnosed with HIV/Aids, the officer reviewed numerous reports including the
Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Aids 2008 Progress Report
for Hungary and was not persuaded that treatment would not be available to the applicant. Another report cited was an
Immigration and Refugee Board Research Directorate
document titled, "
Hungary: Entitlement to free medical care and treatment for a citizen's HIV positive condition on his or her return to Hungary, following a three year absence from the country
". Based on these reports it was found that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant would be denied medical treatment.
