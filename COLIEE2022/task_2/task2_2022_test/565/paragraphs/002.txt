The plaintiff sued the defendant for patent infringement and claimed the usual relief consequent thereon. The statement of claim was filed on July 31, 1984. The defendant filed an amended statement of defence and counterclaim on or about January 31, 1986. In addition to defending the claim of patent infringement, the defendant counterclaimed for injury to its reputation and business and damages therefor, including punitive damages. Paragraph 20 of the defence and counterclaim pleads as follows:
"20. The plaintiff has willfully and unlawfully informed customers and potential customers of the defendant, including departments of the United States armed forces, that the plaintiff is the owner of the patent and of certain technology rights associated therewith, that the defendant infringes the patent, and that the plaintiff intends to or has instituted an infringement action against the defendant under the patent, thereby damaging the reputation and business of the defendant."
