The underlying rationale of the prothonotary's decision is thus explained in his reasons:
"As a result of the thorough review by counsel, I have concluded that 'resulting damage' referred to by Martland, J., in S. & S. requires at least proof of facts from which it can be concluded that damage 'surely' resulted.
"For such facts to be proved, there must be some allegation in the pleadings to which the necessary facts can be related, be it an allegation of a general loss of business as was sufficient in Ratcliffe or some specific person or persons to whom the alleged false or misleading statements were communicated, which it was indicated would be sufficient in Diamond Shamrock Corporation v. Hooker Chemicals & Plastics Corp. et al., 60 C.P.R.(2d) 166. There were no such allegations in the pleading before me. In addition, I note that plaintiff's counsel stated that on discovery, no person who had withheld business as a result of the communication was mentioned. This was not denied and I, therefore, did not request that the transcript for discovery be placed in evidence."
