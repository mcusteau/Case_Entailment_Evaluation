Counsel for the defendant submits that the learned prothonotary clearly erred in law in making the decision to strike by failing to apply or even consider the justificatory standard that it was plain and obvious beyond doubt that the defendant's cause of action under s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act was devoid of merit. She strongly urges that the prothonotary proceeded on a wrong principle and fundamentally misunderstood the pleading in determining that there was a failure to prove facts from which it could be concluded that damage "surely" resulted. She contends forcibly that the prothonotary's finding that there were no allegations in the pleading as to general loss of business or the identification of the persons to whom the false or misleading statements were allegedly made constituted a patent error by reason that the pleadings did both. Defendant's counsel also stresses the general rule against striking a pleading where the other party has pleaded over to it or where, as in the present case, there has been a delay of almost four years in bringing on the motion to strike.
