I will begin by saying that I do not accept this last mentioned submission. In my view, there is nothing in s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act that categorically characterizes the damage resulting from disparaging statements in the nature of a trade libel as special damages, which must be particularly quantified and specially pleaded. As Spence, J., observed in S. & S. Industries, supra, in actions based on s. 7 of the Trade Marks Act, the complainant "... need only prove the action of which he complains and the damage which he incurred as a result thereof".
