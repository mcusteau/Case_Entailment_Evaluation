In The Queen v. Mancuso Estate, [1982] 1 F.C. 259; 35 N.R. 344 (C.A.), a case much relied on by defendant's counsel, Urie, J., dealt with the pleading of general damages at p. 268:
"... there is no requirement in the General Rules and Orders of this court, so far as I am aware, requiring the amount of general damages to be stated in the pleadings. That being so, the principle relating to general relief is not limited by the failure to disclose the quantum of damages sought.
. . . . .
"So far as the quantum is concerned, it must be remembered that the damages here are general damages. As such they are presumed to be the direct, natural or probable consequence of the act complained of."
