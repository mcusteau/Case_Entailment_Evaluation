Admittedly, the pleading technique employed in paragraph 20 of the defendant's counterclaim leans to the general rather than the particular in linking the alleged false statements to the damage likely to result therefrom. The concluding words "thereby damaging the reputation and business of the defendant" are amply sufficient, as it seems to me, to raise an allegation of general loss of business which, when coupled with the identification of the twelve additional customers in the reply to the demand for particulars, should have sufficed to dispel the prothonotary's concern about the insufficiency of the pleadings. The learned prothonotary seems to have fallen into the error of confusing what must be proven at trial to justify an award of damages for trade libel with what must be pleaded to raise a case of general loss of business as a legitimate cause of action under s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act. The claim is one for general relief and the rule is clear that the amount of general damages alleged to flow from the act complained of need not be specially pleaded and quantified.
