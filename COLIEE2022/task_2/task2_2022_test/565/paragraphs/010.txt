Counsel for the plaintiff makes the initial point that an appeal from a prothonotary is not a hearing de novo on the merits, but rather is an appeal in which the appellant has the burden of establishing on balance of probability that the order appealed from was clearly wrong in law or on the facts. He argues that the prothonotary's determination that there were no material facts to support the general allegation of loss of business and reputation should not be disturbed. He contends that a cause of action for loss of business is only sustainable in cases where there has been a general broadcasting of the false or misleading statements complained of, and says this is what the prothonotary was really addressing. Plaintiff's counsel further submits that ss. 7(a) and 53 of the Trade Marks Act, read together and in context, clearly create a statutory cause of action for which only special damages can be awarded. In his submission, the reference in S. & S. Industries, supra, to "resulting damage" must be taken to allude to "special damages".
