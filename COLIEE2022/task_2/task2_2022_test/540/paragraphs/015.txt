In the present matter, the respondent, in support of its allegation, has asserted two facts, firstly that the process disclosed in the patent of the first person involves the decarboxylation of a compound of formula IX (The respondent recognized during the hearing that its detailed statement erroneously refers to formula XI, and that the reference should be to formula IX.) as this process is described in the first person's patent, a fact which is neutral and obviously not in dispute, and secondly that the process used by its supplier does not involve this process. Put in its most favourable light, the allegation is that the process of the first person as identified by the second person is the patented process for producing ketorolac tromethamine, and as the second person will not utilize this process, the first person's patent will not be infringed.
