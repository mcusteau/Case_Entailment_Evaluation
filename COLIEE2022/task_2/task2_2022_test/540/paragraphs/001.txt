Noel, J.
: This is an application by Syntex (U.S.A.) Inc. ("Syntex") and Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. ("Hoffmann-La Roche") (Syntex and Hoffmann-La Roche amalgamated to form Hoffmann-La Roche on January 1, 1995. In these reasons the amalgamated entity is referred to as the "applicants" or the "first person".) for an order prohibiting the Minister of National Health and Welfare (the "Minister") from issuing a Notice of Compliance (NOC) to Novopharm Limited ("Novopharm", the "respondent" or the "second person") in respect of the medicine ketorolac tromethamine, including the medicine ketorolac tromethamine tablets, until after the expiration of each of Canadian patent Nos. 1,111,431, 1,168,244, and 1,102,809. (The application, as filed, sought relief with respect to all three patents. However, in view of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Deprenyl Research Ltd. v. Apotex Inc.
(1995), 180 N.R. 323 (F.C.A.), to the effect that process claims do not fall within the meaning of the phrase "claim for the medicine itself", the applicants have conceded, for the purposes of this hearing, subject to preserving their rights on appeal, that the claims in patent Nos. 1,111,431 and 1,168,244 do not contain a "claim for the medicine itself".)
