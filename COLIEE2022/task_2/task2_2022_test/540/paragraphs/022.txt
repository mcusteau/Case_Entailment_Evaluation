A description of the invention disclosed by this patent is found in the specification: (Applicants' Record, at 69-70.)
"The present invention relates to certain novel pyrrole-l-carboxylic acid compounds and to a process for the production thereof.
"More particularly, this invention relates to novel 5-aroyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo {1,2-a}pyrrole-l-carboxylic acids represented by the formula
[see printed version]
and the individual (l)-acid isomers and the (d)-acid isomers thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic esters and salts thereof, wherein R represents hydrogen or a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R
1
represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, chloro, fluoro or bromo, the R
1
substitution being at the ortho, meta or para positions of the aroyl group, to the method for the productions thereof and to novel intermediates obtained thereby.
. . . . .
"Salts derived from pharmaceutically acceptable oragnic [sic] nontoxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines (...), cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as (...)
tromethamine
... Particular preferred organic nontoxic bases are isopropylamine, diethylamine, ethanolamine, piperidine,
tromethamine
, dicyclohexylamine, choline and caffeine." (my emphasis)
