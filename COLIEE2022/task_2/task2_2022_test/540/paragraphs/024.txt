Having set out the principal steps of the process described in the patent specification, I turn now to the claims to identify the steps of the process described in the patent which are claimed by the patent. The two relevant claims are Claims 1 and 38. Claim 1 is a process claim, while Claim 38 is a product by process claim, where the process is that described in Claim 1, and the product is a compound selected from the group of those represented by the formula of compound (A). These claims read as follows:
1. A process for producing a compound of the formula:
[see printed version]
or the individual (l)-acid isomers and (d)-acid isomers thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic esters and salts thereof, wherein R represents hydrogen or a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R
1
represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, chloro, fluoro or bromo, the R
1
substitution being at the ortho, meta or para positions of the aroyl group which
comprises one or more of the following steps
:
(a) condensing a compound of the formula
wherein R is as defined above and R
2
is a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, with an amide of the formula
wherein R
1
is as defined above, thereby yielding the corresponding compounds of the formula
wherein R, R
1
and R
2
are as defined above;
b) hydrolyzing an alkyl ester group thereby yielding the free acids of Formula (A);
c) separating the free acids of Formula (A) into their corresponding respective (l)-acid isomers and (d)-acid isomers;
d) racemizing the (d)-acid isomers or the salts thereof, to the corresponding respective compounds of Formula (A);
e) optionally esterifying the carboxylic acid function in the compounds of Formula (A) or the (l)-acid isomers or (d)-acid isomers thereof or converting each of them into their pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic salts;
f) converting the salts of Formula (A) and the individual isomers thereof, to the corresponding free acids.
38. A compound selected from the group of those represented by the formula:
[see printed version]
and the individual (l)-acid isomers and (d)-acid isomers thereof and the pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic esters and salts thereof, wherein R represents hydrogen or a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms and R
1
represents hydrogen, a lower alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a lower alkoxy group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, chloro, fluoro or bromo, the R
1
substitution being at the ortho, meta or para positions of the aroyl group when prepared by the process of Claim 1. (My emphasis.)
