In the present case, as the respondent has alleged no facts to which the regulatory presumption can attach and by reference to which a decision favourable to it could be reached, and as it has otherwise advanced no evidence in support of its allegation, I must conclude that insofar as patent 1,102,809 is concerned, the allegation made is not justified.
