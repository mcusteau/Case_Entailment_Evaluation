To borrow the words of Hugessen, J.A., in
Merck
, supra, at 319 [C.P.R.]:
"In determining whether ... the allegations are 'justified', the court must decide whether on the basis of such facts as have been assumed or proven, the allegations would give rise in law to the conclusion that the patent would not be infringed."
and where no facts are alleged or proven, there is no basis upon which this conclusion can be reached. In such instances, it would seem that the first person can discharge its legal burden by merely making this demonstration without the need of adducing any evidence.
