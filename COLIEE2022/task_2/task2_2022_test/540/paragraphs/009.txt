The applicants take issue with the sufficiency of the allegation made by the respondent and in particular with the statement offered in support thereof. In the respondent's own words, the only reason offered to justify the allegation is that "the process used to manufacture ketorolac tromethamine (is) different than that which is disclosed in the patent". (Respondent's Memorandum, p. 3, par. 8.) The applicants submit that a reference to the patented process of the first person followed by a mere statement by the second person to the effect that it does not use such a process or that its process is not the same does not meet the requirement of s. 5(3)(a) of the
Regulations
.
("5(3) Where a person makes an allegation pursuant to paragraph 1(b) or subsection (2), the person shall
(a) provide a detailed statement of the legal and factual basis for the allegation;")
