As is apparent from the underlined portion of Claim 1, it claims "a process for producing a compound of the formula (A) ... which comprises
one or more
of the following steps". It follows that in order to succeed, the allegation made by the second person must, on the face of it, allow for the conclusion that its process contains none of the steps described in Claim 1. As the second person's allegation only relates to one step, it does not allow for this conclusion.
