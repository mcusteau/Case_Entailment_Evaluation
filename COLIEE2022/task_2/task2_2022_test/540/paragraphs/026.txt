Furthermore, it also appears that the step that is the subject of the allegation is not one that is claimed in the patent. The allegation is that the process used by the second person or its supplier for the manufacture of ketorolac tromethamine does not involve the decarboxylation of a compound of Formula IX. This corresponds to step 5 of the process described above. The decarboxylation step precedes the condensation step (step 6, claimed in part (a) of Claim 1 of the patent). It also precedes the hydrolysis step (step 7, claimed in part (b) of Claim 1), which produces the free acids of Formula (A). Because the steps claimed in parts (c) through (f) of Claim 1 of the patent involve the free acids of Formula (A) produced by step 7 or the (l)-acid isomers or (d)-acid isomers thereof (produced by steps 8 and 9, claimed in part (c) of Claim 1), they must also logically follow the decarboxylation step. Therefore, the decarboxylation step (step 5) precedes all the steps claimed in Claim 1 of the patent. In the result, although the decarboxylation step is described in the patent, it is not claimed by the patent. Consequently, the absence of the decarboxylation step in the respondent's process does not provide any basis to support its allegation of noninfringement.
