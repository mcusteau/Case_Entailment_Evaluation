As to this last proposition, the applicants correctly point out that in
Pharmacia Inc.
, supra, the Court of Appeal left open the possibility that the common law presumption could apply in the event that the conditions precedent to its application were established by the party invoking it. The applicants purport to have done so in this instance. However, even if that be so, I do not believe that the common law presumption was intended to apply in these proceedings. It would be very unusual if, indeed, this presumption did apply to shift the burden that has been specifically cast on the parties by a regulatory scheme. (None of the case law relied upon by the applicants in support of the application of the common law presumption involved such a scheme. The common law presumption has been applied in matters of contractual disputes (
Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Apotex Inc.
(1983), 71 C.P.R.(2d) 20 (Ont. H.C.), civil liability or tort (
Canadian Northern Quebec R. Co. v. Pleet
, [1923] 4 D.L.R. 1112 (S.C.C.)), civil and criminal negligence (
Snell v. Farrell
, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 311; 110 N.R. 200; 107 N.B.R.(2d) 94; 267 A.P.R. 94;
Cook v. Lewis
, [1951] S.C.R. 830).) In my view, the answer to the concerns raised by the applicants in invoking the common law presumption is to be found within the confines of the regulatory scheme as it has been elucidated by the case law.
