The problem with this type of allegation is that it purports to allege as a fact the conclusion which the court is called upon to reach upon adjudicating the application. Where, in the context of a product by process claim (The patent in issue makes such a claim), a second person compares its drug to that of a first person, the issue to be decided by the court is whether the process used by the second person to produce the same drug as that produced by the first person is or is not the same as the process used by the first person. As was stated by Mahoney, J.A., in
Bayer A.G. v. Canada
(1993), 163 N.R. 183; 51 C.P.R.(3d) 329 (F.C.A.), at 337 [C.P.R.]:
"(...) all that is in issue here is whether the process by which the medicine is to be produced by or for Apotex (the second person) is so different from that patented as to result in the medicine not infringing Bayer's (the first person's) patent." (As in the present matter the claim in issue was a product by process claim and the only allegation was that the process of the second person was different from the patented process. (at p. 335 [C.P.R.]))
If the court concludes that the process is the same or essentially the same as the patented process, infringement will have been made out and prohibition will issue. Otherwise, it will not. It follows that an isolated assertion to the effect that the process used by the second person is not the same as that used by the first person without more does not give rise to a presumption that that is indeed the case. Whether this process is the same or not is a matter for the court to decide and while the facts underlying this conclusion can be presumed, the conclusion itself cannot.
