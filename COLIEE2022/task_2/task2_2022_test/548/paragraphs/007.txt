[7]
In the Officerâ€™s notes recorded in the Global Case Management System dated February 14, 2018, the Officer wrote that in addition to what the Applicant recalled in his responses to the procedural fairness letter, he was also refused a US visa while in Canada in 2017 and in Saudi Arabia in 2013. As the Applicant had not addressed these in response to the procedural fairness letter, the Officer was not convinced the Applicant was being truthful.
