In this case, the Officer had specifically advised the Applicant that he may not have been truthful about his past visas and permits. An immigration applicant exercising normal due diligence should have sought to clarify the status of an application he had made some years ago. Alternatively, the Applicant could have simply mentioned his other application. The Applicant had a duty to answer truthfully and cannot rely on the fact that he did not know of the decision in his 2012 visa application to explain why he never disclosed the fact that he had made it upon receipt of the Officer’s concerns. This is not a case, such as Punia, where it was evident from the record that the Applicant was confused about the information required and clearly failed to understand that a prior application for permanent residence was a “visa application.”
