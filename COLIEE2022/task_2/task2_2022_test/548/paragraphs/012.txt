The Applicant submits that the procedural fairness letter was deficient in that it failed to refer to the two US visa refusals, particularly the one in 2013. He contends that he was unaware of the 2013 refusal until he received the Officer’s decision, as he had not been informed of it by the US authorities. Lacking such information, the Applicant submits, he was unable to know the case to be met or to respond to the Officer’s allegation of his untruthfulness: Punia v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 184 at para 62 [Punia]; Hamza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 264 at paras 25–28. He was left to engage in a “guessing game” and to determine on his own which aspect of the application was inaccurate.
