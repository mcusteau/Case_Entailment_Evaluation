The first four (4) issues quoted above relate to the Officer's rather summary dismissal of four (4) letters placed before the Officer by A.B. to corroborate his fear of return to his country of origin based on sensitive personal information. The last issue proved to be a non-issue before the Court. It was acknowledged by counsel before the Court that, if A.B.'s claim to [sensitive personal information] were accepted, there would be a real, though not necessarily determinative, issue regarding return of A.B. to his country of origin.
