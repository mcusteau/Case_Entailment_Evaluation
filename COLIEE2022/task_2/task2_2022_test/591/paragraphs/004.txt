[4]
In a decision relating to A.B., the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board wrote:
The appellant is an individual who has already been before the predecessor tribunal of the IAD under an earlier removal order for criminality. This order was issued on July 27, 1976. [A.B.] was given a stay of the execution of the deportation order on March 9, 1977. This stay was completed and the order quashed on June 29, 1978. Therefore, the appellant has had the benefit of the exercise of the tribunal's discretionary jurisdiction before. [A.B.] is aware that [he] would have been required, at the very least, not to participate in further criminal behaviour. [A.B.] did have further criminal convictions. [A.B.] would also know that [he] would be expected to tell the truth in explaining [his] current circumstances to the panel. Given the inconsistencies in [his] testimony, it is apparent that [he] has not been credible. Therefore, the granting of another stay would not be an appropriate application of the panel's discretionary jurisdiction.
The foregoing conclusion led to A.B.'s application for a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment, the decision on which is now before this Court.
