Justices Bastarache and Lebel continued at paragraph [57] of their reasons:
An exhaustive review is not required in every case to determine the proper standard of review. Here again, existing jurisprudence may be helpful in identifying some of the questions that generally fall to be determined according to the correctness standard ...this simply means that the analysis required is already deemed to have been performed and need not be repeated.
I regard the foregoing paragraph as being equally applicable in the determination of questions that generally fall to be determined according to the "reasonableness" standard. Based on earlier jurisprudence of this Court, I am satisfied that here the analysis generally required has already been performed and therefore need not be repeated. [see footnote 4]
