[19]
With respect to the letter from A. B.'s friend of long standing, once again, the Officer was concerned about the friend's interest "...in the outcome of this application ..." as a friend of the Applicant. Further, the Officer once again expressed concern that the friend might merely be repeating what A.B. had told him. For these reasons, once again, the Officer assigned the friend's letter little weight.
