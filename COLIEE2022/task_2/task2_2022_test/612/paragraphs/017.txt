The gist of the AGC's argument on its motions is that Rocky Mountain's application is bereft of any possibility of success and thus must fail. The grounds of the AGC's motion to strike out the first application can be summarized as questioning whether the Trial Division of the Federal Court has any jurisdiction to hear the application. As to the second application the AGC submits that mandamus cannot be granted and thus the proceeding should be struck out.
