The first application of Rocky Mountain is beyond the jurisdiction of the Federal Court Trial Division, it clearly falling within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of Appeal. The application is struck out, subject to Rocky Mountain, within the next 30 days, bringing an application before a judge of the Trial Division in order to see if the proceeding might be transferred to the Federal Court of Appeal. Such a transfer to the Federal Court of Appeal is necessary even where several authorities are attacked, but only one matter comes within s. 28 of the
Federal Court Act
and the mandate of the Federal Court of Appeal: see for example
Alberta Wilderness Associaton et al. v. Express Pipelines Ltd. et al.
(1997), 201 N.R. 336; 137 D.L.R.(4th) 177 (F.C.A.) and particularly at pp. 340-341.
