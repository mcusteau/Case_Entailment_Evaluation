The grounds for the first application of Rocky Mountain are that the NEB made use of information provided by DFO and PFRA which entities, according to Rocky Mountain, did not participate in the public hearing in respect of the project. Among the alternatives, Rocky Mountain says that the NEB restricted the participation of DFO and PFRA to the role of advisers instead of imposing upon them the duties of responsible authorities. The grounds alleged in the second application are that DFO and PFRA did not fulfill their duties and functions as responsible authorities as set out in ss. 11 and 12 of the
CEA Act
, particularly s. 12(3) and (4) which, according to Rocky Mountain, impose a duty on DFO and PFRA to provide any relevant and important information to the review panel conducting an environmental assessment of a project. In addition, Rocky Mountain says that DFO and PFRA, as responsible authorities, should have been involved as such in holding the pipeline hearing. Here one might observe that even if DFO and PFRA are in some way responsible authorities within the
CEA Act
, they and the NEB, by s. 12(1) of the
Act
, have the discretion to determine how they will perform their functions.
