[36]
The legislation does not stipulate any specific manner in which responsible authorities or federal authorities are to cooperate. Nowhere in the
Act
does it provide that DFO and PFRA, either as responsible authorities or as federal authorities in possession of specialist or expert information, must cooperate in holding hearings in a specific way or provide to the review panel any specific information unless requested to do so. To allow such remedy, in the absence of a legal right and a due duty, would be outside the scope of mandamus. Thus the applicant's argument must fail in this respect.
