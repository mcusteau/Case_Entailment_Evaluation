To the contrary, Rocky Mountain says it exchanged much correspondence with DFO and PFRA in respect of the drilling method. Rocky Mountain went on to make a motion to the NEB panel for an adjournment of the hearing pending receipt of information from DFO, but its motion was denied. It is interesting to note the position of NEB in their ruling dated 23 January 1998 (part of the Exhibit D, AGC's Record Vol. II p. 20):
"Under the
NEB Act
, the Board has a discretion as to the amount of information necessary for it to set an application down for a hearing. The information generally required is set out in the Board's
Guidelines for Filing Requirements
('
Guidelines
').
. . . . .
"On more than one occasion the Board has pointed out to parties that the purpose of those
Guidelines
is to ensure that the Board has sufficient information for it to hold a proceeding. This does not mean it has sufficient information to make a determination that the proposed project is in the public convenience and necessity.
"Similarly, the question to be dealt with in relation to this motion is not whether the Board has sufficient information to determine if the environmental effects of the proposal are likely to be significant or insignificant. In fact, if the Board required that there be sufficient information on the record to make that clear determination, it would mean that the Board would, in essence, foreclose the option of being able to find that it is uncertain whether or not the project is likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. Rather the question is whether the information filed by Alliance is sufficient to permit an environmental assessment process to be undertaken. The information filed is then examined, questioned and tested by way of written and oral questions and the evidence of the other parties.
"The applicant in an environmental assessment process always faces the possibility that the ultimate outcome, after a consideration of the evidence, is that it is found likely or uncertain that the environmental effects will be significant.
"In this instance the Board is of the view that there is sufficient information on the record to permit the environmental impact assessment under the
CEA Act
to proceed ... Therefore the motion of RMEC for an adjournment is dismissed."
