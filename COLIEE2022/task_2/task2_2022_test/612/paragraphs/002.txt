The first application ("T-8-99") seeks an order to set aside or quash the decision of the National Energy Board (also referred to as the "NEB") rendered on November 26, 1998 in respect of the project. The second application ("T-9-99") seeks relief in the nature of mandamus compelling the Department of Fisheries and Oceans ("DFO") and the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration ("PFRA") to conduct a panel review of the project so as to fulfill their alleged duties as responsible authorities as defined in the s. 11(1) of the
Canadian Environmental Assessment Act
(the "
CEA Act
"). To paraphrase, a responsible authority, as defined, includes a federal authority charged with issuing an approval or permit to allow a project to proceed. Here the NEB was certainly a responsible authority: it was charged with issuing a certificate to authorize the construction of a natural gas pipeline to be built by Alliance Pipeline Ltd. ("Alliance"). There may be more than one responsible authority and then such responsible authorities work together as set out in s. 12 of the
CEA Act
. However there is also another role for government bodies, such as, in this instance, DFO and PFRA and that is participation under s. 12(3) of the
CEA Act
, by which such federal bodies make available specialist or expert evidence to the responsible authority, that is, in this instance, to the NEB. The point is that DFO and PFRA are not necessarily responsible authorities, but rather may be a federal authorities with information useful to the NEB, all as envisioned by s. 12(3) of the
CEA Act
.
