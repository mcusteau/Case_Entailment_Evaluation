There are, however, exceptions whereby a motion to strike out an application may be granted. Counsel for the respondent AGC refers to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Bull (David) Laboratories (Canada) Inc. v. Pharmacia Inc. et al.
, [1995] 1 F.C. 588; 176 N.R. 48, where it was suggested that the court may strike out any application which is "so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success." (p. 600). The decision of the same court in
Moldevenau v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 235 N.R. 192, elaborates on the principle in
David Bull
as including a situation in which an "affidavit at its face could not support the proceeding at issue," (p. 194) at which point the application is bereft of any possibility of success. The Court of Appeal then specifically notes that "We express no opinion as to the effect of new rule 221 (which has replaced old rule 419) on the principle set out above" (loc. sit.). Also pertinent, jurisdiction being at issue, is
Cyanamid Agricultural De Puerto Rico Inc. v. Canada
(1984), 74 C.P.R. 133, involving an application under s. 41 of the
Patent Act
. There the respondent, by an interlocutory motion, sought to strike out Cyanamid's application. In leading to a dismissal for Cyanamid's application for want of jurisdiction, Mr. Justice Mahoney said:
"... the
Rules of Court
make no provision for a respondent to move for summary dismissal of an application for a want of jurisdiction as is provided to a defendant in an action by rule 419. I agree that, ordinarily, a respondent ought to make his entire reply to an application when it is returnable and I should be prepared to discourage questionable interlocutory proceedings by imaginative awards of costs; however, where the motion itself is apt to be time consuming and where there is, as here, a clear question of jurisdiction which may determine the entire matter, common sense dictates, and rule 5 permits, that the court deal with the preliminary objection in advance." (p. 135)
If at this point jurisdiction is found wanting, striking out the applications will save the time, money and resources of all concerned. With these principles in mind, I will now deal with each application in turn.
