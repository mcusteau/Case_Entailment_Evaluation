The court has always been reluctant to strike out an originating application. Rule 221 (formerly rule 419), which deals with striking out, applies to actions. There are various reasons for this usual stance against striking out an application. For example, in contrast to an action, the merit of the application is decided on affidavit evidence and documentation in a summary way. Thus, the court may be a little less concerned with preserving the resources of the court. In a judicial review setting, the role of the court is in part an expediter leading the parties to the hearing stages as quickly as possible. This usually makes a motion to strike unnecessary. This, when combined with the general reluctance of the courts to strike out any proceeding or an interlocutory motion, leads to the proposition that originating applications will generally not be struck.
