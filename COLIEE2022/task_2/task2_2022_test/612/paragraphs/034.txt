Rocky Mountain submits that, by virtue of the above sections of the
CEA Act
, DFO and PFRA have a duty to disclose any relevant information that they have to the NEB panel. I disagree. The sections only stipulate that the environmental assessment be conducted in a timely fashion and either that federal authorities make available expert information when requested (s. 12(3)) or that, if there is more than one responsible authority capable of holding a hearing, they together determine how they will perform their duties and functions (s. 12(1)). The parties say that DFO and PFRA identified themselves as responsible authorities for the assessment of the project and that they exchanged a substantial amount of correspondence with the NEB in respect of the project, albeit some of the correspondence was not produced at the hearing.
