Rocky Mountain, for its part, argues that their applications, especially the second proceeding, are properly commenced in the Trial Division since Rocky Mountain does not necessarily request the court to review the decision of NEB, but rather ask the court to review the collateral action or inaction by which DFO and PFRA are said to be in breach of their duty as responsible authorities. Rocky Mountain also requests the direction of this court in the management of these proceedings. Since the success of Rocky Mountain's motion seeking direction depends on the outcome of the AGC's motion, I will deal with the AGC's motion first.
