There is another vantage point for looking at this issue, suggested in the NEB's submission and also by the style of cause, which refers to s. 22 of the
National Energy Board Act
. Section 22 provides a right of appeal from a decision of the Board to the Federal Court of Appeal "on a question of law or jurisdiction," after leave to appeal has been obtained from that court. An intended appellant must file a leave application within 30 days from the decision, otherwise the decision becomes final and conclusive. (Section 23(1) of the
Act
). Section 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
is a further limit on Rocky Mountain's ability to succeed in a judicial review proceeding before the Federal Court Trial Division since it prohibits judicial review of any decision of a federal board insofar as a right to appeal exists in any other statutes. Rocky Mountain failed to exhaust this available avenue. In the event that Rocky Mountain was not truly a party to the proceedings, before the NEB and thus not entitled to an appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal still has the jurisdiction and is the proper court to hear Rocky Mountain's case by way of judicial review: see
Union of Nova Scotia Indians et al. v. Maritimes and Northeast Pipelines Management Ltd. et al.
(1999), 234 N.R. 205.
