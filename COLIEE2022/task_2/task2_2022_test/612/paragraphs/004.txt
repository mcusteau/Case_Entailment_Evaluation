The respondent Attorney General of Canada ("AGC") representing various federal ministers brings a motion to strike out both of Rocky Mountain's applications. The AGC's grounds in respect of the first application, T-8-99, are: (1) that the Trial Division of the Federal Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this matter; (2) that by virtue of s. 18.5 of the
Federal Court Act
and s. 22 of the
National Energy Board Act
("
NEB Act
"), the applicant, Rocky Mountain, is employing an improper procedure for reviewing the decision of the NEB and; (3) in the alternative, if the decision of the NEB is reviewable at all, only the Federal Court of Appeal has the jurisdiction to hear the application.
