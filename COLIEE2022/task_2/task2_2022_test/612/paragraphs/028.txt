Mandamus is a prerogative remedy which may be granted when a person who is delegated with a public duty is in the breach of that duty. It is, for example, exercised by Canadian courts in an application for judicial review against the Ministers of the Crown in respect of failure to fulfill their ministerial duty. Mandamus "compels the performance of a public legal duty" and therefore it is usually directed against the public official. [see footnote 1] Given its coercive and discretionary nature, the circumstances in which the remedy may be granted is now very much circumscribed.
