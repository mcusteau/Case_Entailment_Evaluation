In reviewing the testimony of the Applicant, as well as the testimony of Mr. Alicea, it was open to the Panel to conclude that there was some organization of the gang in Usulutan. Although the testimony of Mr. Alicea, as discussed above, is not very reliable as it relates to El Salvador MS-13 cliques, his evidence as to the gang structure in the United States is informative and reliable. The testimony of the Applicant as to the operation of the gang in Usulutan is consistent with Mr. Aliceaâ€™s descriptions. There were regular meetings, with some sort of hierarchy (although the testimony of the Applicant suggests that the hierarchy is not very strict), the gang engaged in crimes ranging from thefts, to murders for the benefit of the gang (the Applicant himself admits in his testimony at the hearing that he was requested by a gang member in jail to commit a serious crime like a murder for the gang, even though he himself did not follow through on the request). On these facts, it was not unreasonable for the Officer to conclude that this was an organization within the meaning of the section.
