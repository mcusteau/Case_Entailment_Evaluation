Justice O’Reilly’s approach to the definition of organization was affirmed by Justice Linden of the Federal Court of Appeal in Sittampalam v. Canada (M.C.I.), 2006 FCA 326. Justice Linden clarified two issues on appeal. First, Justice Linden confirmed that the provision does not require current membership. Thus, a person can be inadmissible for a prior association. Second, Justice Linden confirmed at paragraph 36 that the definition of organization is to be given a broad and unrestricted definition and affirms the interpretation of organization provided for by Justice O’Reilly at paragraphs 38 to 40:
Recent jurisprudence supports this interpretation. In Thanaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2004] 3 F.C.R. 301 (T.D.), reversed on other grounds, [2006] 1 F.C.R. 474 (C.A.), O'Reilly J. took into account various factors when he concluded that two Tamil gangs (one of which was the A.K. Kannan gang at issue here) were "organizations" within the meaning of paragraph 37(1)(a) of the IRPA. In his opinion, the two Tamil groups had "some characteristics of an organization", namely "identity, leadership, a loose hierarchy and a basic organizational structure" (para. 30). The factors listed in Thanaratnam, supra, as well as other factors, such as an occupied territory or regular meeting locations, both factors considered by the Board, are helpful when making a determination under paragraph 37(1)(a), but no one of them is essential.
These criminal organizations do not usually have formal structures like corporations or associations that have charters, bylaws or constitutions. They are usually rather loosely and informally structured, which structures vary dramatically. Looseness and informality in the structure of a group should not thwart the purpose of IRPA. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt a rather flexible approach in assessing whether the attributes of a particular group meet the requirements of the IRPA given their varied, changing and clandestine character. It is, therefore, important to evaluate the various factors applied by O'Reilly J. and other similar factors that may assist to determine whether the essential attributes of an organization are present in the circumstances. Such an interpretation of "organization" allows the Board some flexibility in determining whether, in light of the evidence and facts before it, a group may be properly characterized as such for the purposes of paragraph 37(1)(a).
With respect to the appellant's argument that criminal jurisprudence and international instruments should inform the meaning of a criminal "organization", I disagree. Although these materials can be helpful as interpretive aides, they are not directly applicable in the immigration context. Parliament deliberately chose not to adopt the definition of "criminal organization" as it appears in section 467.1 of the Criminal Code, R.S. 1985, c. C-46. Nor did it adopt the definition of "organized criminal group" in the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (the "Convention"). The wording in paragraph 37(1)(a) is different, because its purpose is different.
