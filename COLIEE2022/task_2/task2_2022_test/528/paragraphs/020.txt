The scope of organization as defined must be narrowed to the smallest component where the organizations are factionalized. Thus, it is the MS-13 clique in Usulutan that must be defined as an organization. See Bedoya v. Canada (M.C.I.), 2005 FC 1092 at paragraph 20. Justice Oâ€™Reilly provided a comprehensive overview of what constitutes an organization for the purposes of section 37 in Thanaratnam v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2004] 3 F.C.R. 301, 2004 FC 349 at paragraphs 29 to 31, reversed on other grounds, [2006] 1 F.C.R. 474 (C.A.), 2005 FCA 122.
No guidance is given in the Immigration Act or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as to what an "organization" is. By contrast, the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. 46, s. 467.1(1) defines a "criminal organization" in some detail. It states that a criminal organization is a group, "however organized", that is made up of three or more persons and "has as one of its main purposes or activities" the commission of serious criminal offences that would likely yield some kind of benefit to the members of the group. Specifically, a criminal organization under the Code does not include "a group of persons that forms randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence".
The Criminal Code's definition does not apply directly to the immigration setting. However, I believe it is noteworthy that the Code does not require any particular formalities or decision-making arrangements. Presumably, to meet the definition, a group must have some form of organizational structure. The words "however organized" suggest that it must be organized in some fashion, but there are no minimum or mandatory attributes that the group must have.
Here, the two Tamil groups described by the police had some characteristics of an organization - identity, leadership, a loose hierarchy and a basic organizational structure - and I can therefore find no error in the Board's conclusion that they fell within the terms of s. 37(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
