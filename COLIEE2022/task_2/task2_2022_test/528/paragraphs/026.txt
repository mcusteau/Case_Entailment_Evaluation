The Panel found that the Applicant both knew of the criminal activity of the MS-13 and that the Applicant himself engaged in criminal activities. Although the Applicant denied active participation, and attempted in his testimony to distance himself from the activities of the MS-13, his statements indicate otherwise. As stated above, the Panel’s credibility findings related not to the Applicant’s statements regarding his membership, but to his statements at the hearing distancing himself from the gang. For instance, the Panel emphasized that the Applicant admitted to attempting to recruit new members (and successfully recruiting one) and admitted to collecting money for the organization within the community (although not to doing so under threat). He visited a fellow member who was incarcerated. He attended meetings and paid dues to benefit the gang.
