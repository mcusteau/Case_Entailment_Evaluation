The questions at issue both involve applying the facts of the case to the legal tests arising from the legislation. In Thanaratnam v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2006] 1 F.C.R. 474, 2005 FCA 122, a case examining the scope of section 37 of IRPA, Justice Evans concluded at paragraph 27 that determining whether there was sufficient evidence to conclude there was “reasonable grounds to believe” an Applicant was “engaging in activity that is part of” a pattern of criminal activity was a question of mixed fact and law. However, because the issues were largely fact-based, Justice Evans concluded the appropriate standard was patently unreasonable. Thus, where the issues in this case engage questions that are largely fact-based, they will be reviewed against a patently unreasonable standard. However, where the issues involve questions which are less factually intensive, the reasonableness standard will be applied.
