The Panel found reasonable grounds to believe that the MS-13 gang is an “organization” as envisaged by paragraph 37(1)(a).
[…] It is comprised of a group of persons, that there is a hierarchy and structure to the gang. There are leaders and followers. The group is identified by tattoos and the group has a primary purpose of engaging in criminal activities where members derive a benefit from its activities. The evidence shows that the gang is not one that has formed randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence. It is obvious that MS-13 has been existence many years and that criminality is a major portion of their on-going, continuing activities providing financial security among other things.
