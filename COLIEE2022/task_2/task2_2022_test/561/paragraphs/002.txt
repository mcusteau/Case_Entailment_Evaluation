The Applicant indicated in his personal information form ("PIF") that he is a Catholic Tamil, born in Kayts in the northern province of Sri Lanka. While a student at St. Anthony's College in Kayts, the separatist organization, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ("LTTE"), came to the school and wanted him and other students to join their freedom movement. He was only 13 and terrified of joining. The LTTE returned in 1995 and again wanted him to join. He refused and was forcibly taken to a camp and subjected to hard labour. He was exposed to the sweltering heat and forced to dig bunkers. He fell ill and was sent home.
