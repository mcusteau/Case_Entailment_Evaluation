The Applicant went back to Kayts in June 1995, where he was harassed and mistreated by the Sri Lanka armed forces. On suspicion of passing information to the LTTE and supporting them, he was arrested on February 12, 1999, and kept in detention and underwent "untold sufferings". He was questioned about the LTTE and was released after three days when his mother signed a surety. But the army continued to harass the Applicant and asked him to report to their camp in Kayts. Whenever he went there, he was subjected to inhumane treatment and, as a result, he moved to Columbo on November 6, 2000, and contacted an agent who assisted him in leaving Sri Lanka for Canada. He left Columbo on November 9, 2001, and arrived in Canada on November 21, 2001.
