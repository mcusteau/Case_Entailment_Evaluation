The Applicant claimed to fear persecution in Sri Lanka due to his identity as a young Tamil from the north. The Member indicated that the determinative issues in the Applicant's claim were the "interwoven issues of credibility and the identity of the [Applicant] as a young Tamil who was in the north at times material to his claim." Because the Member was not able "to determine the claimant's identity relative to his residence because of lack of credible evidence," he was "unable to further assess his risk of persecution in Sri Lanka."
