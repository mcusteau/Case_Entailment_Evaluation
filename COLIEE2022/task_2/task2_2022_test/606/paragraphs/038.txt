The Board heard evidence to the effect that Mr. Thanaratnam was linked to gang-related activity. But this is not, as the police witnesses themselves readily acknowledged before the Board, sufficient evidence from which to draw an inference that a person is a gang member. According to criteria used by police, other factors must be taken into account before one can draw an inference that a person may be a gang member. The Board set out those criteria in its reasons:
· involvement directly or indirectly in a gang-related crime or incident;
· acknowledges gang membership or gang association;
· identified as a gang member or gang associate by physical evidence;
· identified as a gang member or gang associate by reliable source information;
· police information provided or received as the result of directly observed association with other known gang members or gang associates;
· common or symbolic gang identifier(s) or paraphernalia;
· previous court findings including, but not limited to sworn testimonials that the person is a gang member or gang associate.
