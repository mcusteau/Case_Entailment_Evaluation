The Board found that the Tamil gangs with which Mr. Thanaratnam was allegedly associated were "organizations" within the meaning of that term in s. 37(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Board stated:
a) The groups or "gangs" known as V.V.T. and A.K. Kannan are organizations that exist, and that operate primarily in the Toronto area.
b) There are reasonable grounds to believe that these two groups are engaged in criminal activity including assaults, drug offences, kidnappings, weapons offences etc. This activity is contrary to either the Criminal Code or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
c) The criminal activity is planned and organized by a number of persons acting in concert - planned in particular by the group leaders primarily and put into effect by the members.
