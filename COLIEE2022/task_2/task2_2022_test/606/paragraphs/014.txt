However, Mr. Thanaratnam argues that the prevailing case law clearly instructs the Board not to rely on outstanding charges or other information about alleged criminal conduct - it must only consider actual convictions. True, Rouleau J., for example, has held that outstanding, unresolved criminal charges must not be considered by the Board when determining whether a person represents a danger to the Canadian public:
It must be emphasized that unresolved criminal charges are, until proven otherwise, nothing more than mere allegations against an accused. They are not indicative of guilt and obviously therefore, are not indicative of a propensity to re-offend either, until they have been proven beyond a reasonable doubt by the Crown in a court of law. Accordingly, they are inadmissible in the determination of whether an applicant constitutes a danger to the public. (Bakchiev v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1881, at para. 12.)
