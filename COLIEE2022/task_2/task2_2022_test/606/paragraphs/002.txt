A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board found that the Minister had proved both allegations and that Mr. Thanaratnam should therefore be deported from Canada. Mr. Thanaratnam admits that he has been convicted of offences punishable by five or more years of imprisonment and, therefore, does not contest the Board's finding on that issue. However, he does argue that the Board made a serious error when it concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe he was a member of a criminal organization. In his application for judicial review, he asks me to overturn that part of the Board's decision and refer the matter back to another panel of the Board.
