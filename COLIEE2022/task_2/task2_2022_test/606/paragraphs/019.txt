Fourth, the issue here is whether there are grounds for believing Mr. Thanaratnam is a member of a group involved in crime. The question is not whether he was personally responsible for a particular offence. Reasonable grounds for believing that a person is a member of a group dedicated to criminal activity does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt that his or her involvement in that activity rose to the level of actual commission of offences or even culpable participation in them as a party. In other words, the fact that a person has been charged with a crime may be relevant to the issue of membership, even where there is an absence of proof that would satisfy the criminal standard of liability.
