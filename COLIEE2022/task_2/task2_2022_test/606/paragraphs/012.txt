In other words, "reasonable grounds to believe" is more than mere suspicion. It connotes a degree of probability based on credible evidence. In other jurisprudence, the Supreme Court of Canada has described it as a "reasonable probability"or a "reasonable belief": R. v. Debot, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140, at 1166. However, it is certainly less than a balance of probabilities, as has been made clear in immigration cases: Chan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1996] 3 F.C. 349 (T.D.); Chiau v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] 2 F.C. 642 (T.D.).
