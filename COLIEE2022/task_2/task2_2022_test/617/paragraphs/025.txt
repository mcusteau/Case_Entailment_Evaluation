The fourth letter, dated March 12, 207, is from Deputy Mayor of the Colombo Municipal Council (the Deputy Mayor's Letter). Although he was also a long-time friend of the Applicant's father, the letter is silent about the Disappearance and says nothing about the Tenants. It reads:
This is to certify that bearer Mr. Mohideen Osman Mohamed Mohamed Faazil (ID No 862341880) of No 107, Dawalasingharama Road, Colombo 15 is known to be for a considerable period of time.
He comes from a respectable family as bears a good moral character. He is honest trustworthy and hard working person.
I have great pleasure to recommended him to any who require his services.
I wish him all success.
