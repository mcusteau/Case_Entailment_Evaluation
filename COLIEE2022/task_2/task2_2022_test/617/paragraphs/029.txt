The Applicant's entire claim depended on the existence of the Tenants. For this reason and because he gave inconsistent evidence about what floors of the family home were occupied and by whom, it was open to the Board to look for evidence confirming the Tenants lived in the house. In my view, it was incumbent on the Applicant to explore every reasonable means of obtaining independent verification that the Tenants lived in his family home. The Applicant made no such efforts. He simply said that there was no written lease. He could have attempted through his mother to produce, for example, documents showing rent was paid, letters from neighbours or friends who visited the house and had seen the Tenants or a letter from the broker who accompanied the Tenants to the house and arrange their tenancy, to name just a few possibilities.
