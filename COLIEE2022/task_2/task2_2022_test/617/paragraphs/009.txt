In mid-September 2005, police and army personnel again searched the Applicant's home demanding to know the whereabouts of the Tenants. At that time, he and his father were arrested and detained for about six months (the Detention). The Applicant said that he was beaten about six times during this period and that the authorities tried to make him sign a blank statement. On one occasion, he was hung upside down, tied by his ankles and beaten. During the detention, the Applicant's asthma became worse because he was not receiving his regular treatments.
