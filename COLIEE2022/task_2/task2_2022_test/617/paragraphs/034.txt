The Board also found it implausible that the Doctor's Letter did not explain that the Applicant's asthma treatment had lapsed because of the Detention. Since the hospital had treated him since he was young, it was probable in the Board's view that the doctor would have asked why his condition had deteriorated and would have included the explanation in the Doctor's Letter. It is important to recall that the Doctor's Letter was written at the request of the Applicant's mother to support the Applicant's refugee claim. There was no suggestion that the hospital or the doctor would have faced reprisals if they mentioned the Detention.
