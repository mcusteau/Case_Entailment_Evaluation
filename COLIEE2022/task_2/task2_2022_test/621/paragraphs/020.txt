The applicant has raised a number of issues with respect to the PRRA decision, some of which are more substantial and of more consequences than others. I shall therefore address those of his arguments that I find most compelling, with a view to providing guidance to the panel member who will eventually reassess the applicant's file. These arguments have to do with the following aspects of the decision under review:
• Can short term security detentions amount to persecution?
• Did the PRRA officer apply the correct standard in her section 96 analysis?
• Did the PRRA officer err in her assessment of the evidence?
• Was the applicant's right to procedural fairness breached as a result of the PRRA officer relying on country evidence obtained through independent research?
