R. v. D.D.
, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275; 259 N.R. 156; 136 O.A.C. 201, a case dealing in part with expert evidence, the Supreme Court at paragraph 56 pinpointed the problem of the proliferation of expert opinions:
"... expert evidence is time-consuming and expensive. Modern litigation has introduced a proliferation of expert opinions of questionable value. The significance of the costs to the parties and the resulting strain upon judicial resources cannot be overstated. When the door to the admission of expert evidence is opened too widely, a trial has the tendency to degenerate into 'a contest of experts with the trier of fact acting as referee in deciding which expert to accept'."
