Although the s. 7 interpretation issues have most recently arisen in this Court in the context of NOC proceedings or other intellectual property cases, its application is much more broadly based. The problems inherent in the NOC process cannot drive the interpretation, although they underscore the mischief to which s. 7 was directed. Other cases of civil and criminal nature can have just as difficult and multi-faceted issues and sub-issues for which opinion evidence seems to be ripe.
