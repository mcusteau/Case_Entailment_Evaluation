A further consideration of the
Eli Lilly 1997
decision is that the number of witnesses "per issue" versus "per case" was not the central focus of what was an interlocutory decision made in the course of the trial. The following quote discloses Justice Reed's substantive concern about the meaning of "sides" as applied to "parties". She even describes the results of an interpretation of the right to 5 experts per issue as a "rather unreasonable result".
"Prior to counsel for the defendants calling some of their expert witnesses, counsel for the plaintiffs raised a concern that it appeared as though the defendants were planning on calling more than five witnesses per 'side' on a factual issue (particularly the criticism of Dr. Heeler's survey evidence). An edited version of the reasons I gave orally with respect to this concern was placed on the record. In summary those reasons were that section 7 does not deal with the situation in which separate actions are being heard concurrently; no jurisprudence dealing with the meaning of 'side' could be found; if the word 'side' is interpreted as synonymous with party, this leads to the rather unreasonable result that the three defendants could call fifteen witnesses and the two plaintiffs, being separate parties to each of the three actions, could call thirty expert witnesses
on each factual issue
. Ideally, if anyone had thought of it at the time, this matter should have been dealt with when the application to set the three cases down for concurrent hearing was made."
