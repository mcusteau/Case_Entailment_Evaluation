[56]
This Court has, on a number of occasions, expressed concern for the number and variety of expert reports. The concern is captured in the following from
Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd. et al.
, [2007] F.T.R. Uned. 828; 2007 FC 596, at para. 7:
"It must be pointed out how difficult it is for a court in NOC proceedings to assimilate masses of purportedly expert opinions, predominantly on scientific matters, all in written form, often comprising several volumes. Judges are human, not computers."
