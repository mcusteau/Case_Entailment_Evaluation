The Ontario Court of Appeal in
Buttrum v. Udell
(1925), 57 O.L.R. 97 (C.A.), considered a similar provision and held at para. 10:
"... it is much better that the number of such witnesses called during a trial should be limited to three on each side, and such others as the Court may on application allow, than that the number of these witnesses should be limited only by the number of issues of fact that may actually arise in the course of a trial, or that counsel can with some show of reason argue will arise or have arisen during the trial. If the latter interpretation be given the statute ... the statute would ... either become a dead letter or a new source of trouble, expense, and delay."
