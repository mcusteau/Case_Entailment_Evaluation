This purposive interpretation is buttressed by a plain meaning analysis. There is no reference in the section to "issues". The language is stark in that regard when stipulating 5 experts per party/side per case especially when one reads the section with the relevant aspects isolated:
"
Where, in any
trial or other
proceeding
,
criminal or civil
,
it is intended
by the prosecution or the defence, or
by any party
,
to examine
as witnesses
professional or other
experts entitled
according to the law or practice
to give opinion evidence
,
not more than five of such witnesses may be called
on either side
without the leave of the court or judge or person presiding
."
