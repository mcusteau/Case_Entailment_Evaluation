The learned Prothonotary agreed with the Respondent Novopharm's argument that s. 7 should be interpreted as limiting each party to 5 expert witnesses, regardless of the number of issues requiring expert evidence. However, the learned Prothonotary considered herself bound by the decision in
Merck & Co. et al. v. Canada (Minister of Health) et al.
(2003), 245 F.T.R. 17; 2003 FC 1511 (
Merck 2003
) which she understood to have concluded that s. 7 limits a party/side to 5 experts per issue unless leave of the Court is secured. She succinctly put the issue forward as:
"I am therefore clearly bound to interpret section 7 as applicable to issues in the case, and the Respondent will have to take its argument on that matter to a Judge of this Court or to the Court of Appeal."
