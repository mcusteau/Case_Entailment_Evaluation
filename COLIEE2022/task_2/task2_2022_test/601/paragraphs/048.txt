The Alberta Supreme Court in
Scamen
had to depart from this usual rule because of the rigidity of the Alberta
Evidence
Act
which left the Court no discretion to increase the number of experts irrespective of the circumstances. Farley, J., said as much in
Bank of America Canada
, supra:
"Had the Alberta legislation incorporated the possibility of leave for more experts if the necessity were demonstrated, then there would not have been any problem in otherwise protecting the interests of justice. In fact, just as
Fagnan
was being decided in the Supreme Court of Canada, the Alberta statute was amended to include the following words: ' ... without leave of the court which shall be applied for before the examination of any such witnesses'."
