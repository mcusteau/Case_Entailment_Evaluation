Upon reviewing the reports prepared by the Labour Affairs Officer as well as M. Thomas it is evident that they were aware that the Band had alleged dismissal for cause and that it had been attempting to negotiate a settlement with Mr. Charlie. It is obvious to me that the Adjudicator restricted herself to the paragraph 3 of the letter of appointÂ­ment which made no reference to dismissal for cause or ongoing negotiations to settle. She obviously misdirected herself from the very beginning of her decision when she wrote:
"The employer has not participated in the proceedings, apparently, from the outset."
