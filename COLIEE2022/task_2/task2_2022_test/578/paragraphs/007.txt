From the records of the Adjudicator there is evidence that she attempted to reach either the Chief or some other responsible individual at the Band office by telephone on March 4, 1992, April 10, 1992, and April 22, 1992, in order to attempt to arrange for a hearing date. In a letter dated April 2, 1991, directed to the Band, she refers to attempts to contact them and advises that if she has not received some communication within two weeks from the date of her letter, the matter will be set down for a hearing.
