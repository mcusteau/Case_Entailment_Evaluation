As I read Sopinka, J., he concludes that if a matter before a tribunal has not been finally disposed of, it could be considered a nullity and the tribunal must start anew. Having determined that the Band was not interested in the proceedings, the interim decision, in my view, is tainted. The initial misdirection would be sufficient to "bind the tribunal to start afresh in order to cure the defect". There is also no doubt in my mind that the Adjudicator had a duty to dispose of an issue which the tribunal is empowered to do by statute.
