The Adjudicator determined by her decision of January 1993, that she was functus officio. A reading of the corresponÂ­dence between counsel for the applicant and the Adjudicator clearly reveals that this written discussion was concentrated on the issue of "re-opening" the matter. At no time did Mrs. Bluman entertain or discuss the merits of the dismissal, contrary to what was suggested by counsel for the respondent. To-date there has been no determination on the merits.
