Mr. Sam in his affidavit at paragraph 13 swore as follows:
"I did not fully understand the Chief's instructions to me regarding contacting the lawyers. I did not know which lawyers he meant. As far as I knew, the Band did not have a lawyer. I did not understand the consequences of my being unable to carry out the Chief's instructions out due to my lack of familiarity with the whole process."
