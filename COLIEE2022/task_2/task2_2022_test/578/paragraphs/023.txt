The
Chandler
decision, supra, also appears to suggest flexibility. It should be remembered that the Adjudicator is master of her own procedure and she should have re-opened the proceeding in order to fully assess the merits of the complaint. Section 18 of the
Code
provides that the Canada Labour Relations Board:
"may review, rescind, amend, alter or vary any order or decision
. . . . .
and may rehear any application before making an order in respect of the applicaÂ­tion."
This is a clear indication that her decision should have been re-opened.
