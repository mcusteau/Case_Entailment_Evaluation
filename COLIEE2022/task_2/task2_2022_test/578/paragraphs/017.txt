In referring to the decision of July 8, 1992, I reproduce herewith the second comÂ­plete paragraph of the text:
"The Employer has not participated in this proceeding, apparently, from the outset. It is my understanding that it has yet to provide a written statement giving reasons for dismissal when requested to do so pursuant to the provisions of s. 241(1) of the
Canada Labour Code
. As a result, there are no reasons for the dismissal on record."
