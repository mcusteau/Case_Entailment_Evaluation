The allegations put forward in the applicant's memorandum of fact and law are not supported by an affidavit of the applicant as required by paragraph 10(2)(a) of the Federal Court Rules, 1993, SOR/93-22, as amended SOR/98-235. There is insufficient evidence to establish that the Minister's statement would have had the alleged impact on the applicant so as to support a claim of refugee "sur place". The applicant's testimony is speculative and the applicant's allegations in his memorandum of fact and law are not supported by the evidence. Consequently, the applicant's claims that he is a refugee "sur place" is without merit.
(iv) Did the Board err in its application of s. 97 of the Act?
