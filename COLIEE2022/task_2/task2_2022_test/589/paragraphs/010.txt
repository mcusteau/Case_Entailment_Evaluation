The Board stated that it did not find credible the applicant's statements that the police stood by while he was beaten by the other students, since the documentary evidence showed that police are known to detain members of Islamic militant groups. The Board also found improbable the applicant's story that he did not give the names of Islamic activists to police, nor request police protection, after being harassed and beaten by the activists for three years. The Board also questioned how the applicant was able to secure a passport and leave the country legally when the documentary evidence shows that the government restricts the movement of those critical of it.
