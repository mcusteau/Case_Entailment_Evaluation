Concerning the applicant's arguments on bias, the respondent submits that arguments concerning apprehension of bias must be submitted at the first opportunity: Del Moral v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 782 (QL). The respondent argues that the applicant should have raised the issue of bias at the earliest opportunity. In Del Moral, supra, the applicant's counsel had not objected nor raised any issues of bias during the hearing. Dub√© J. stated that a party arguing reasonably apprehension of bias on the part of a tribunal must allege a violation of natural justice at the earliest practicable opportunity. The jurisprudence of this Court has established that the failure of an applicant to raise the issue of bias forthwith leads to a presumption that he has given up on invoking the reasonable apprehension of bias.
