[22]
I agree with the respondent that the cases raised by the applicant may be distinguished by the fact that in those cases the Board failed to even mention the medical reports. In the case at bar, the Board gave reasons as to why it held that it gave no weight to the report. It stated that the report did not show how the applicant's scars were related to a Convention ground or to his alleged torture and ill-treatment. The Board further stated that since it did not believe the applicant's story, it gave no weight to the report.
