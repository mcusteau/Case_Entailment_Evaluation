[24]
I have carefully reviewed the Board's credibility and plausibility findings and have considered the applicant's oral and written submissions with respect to these findings. I am of the view that the Board gave clear reasons as to why it found the applicant not credible. The Board properly weighed all of the evidence before it and did not err by not specifically mentioning every element of evidence in its reasons. Its credibility and plausibility findings were open to it on the evidence and it properly noted certain elements of evidence omitted in the applicant's PIF. In the circumstances, I do not find the Board's credibility and plausibility findings to be so unreasonable as to warrant the intervention of the Court.
(iii) Did the Board fail to consider arguments raised during the hearing that the applicant was a refugee "sur place"?
