[7]
The Board stated that the applicant had failed to include in his Personal Information Form (PIF) important events revealed in oral testimony. The Board stated that the applicant testified orally that he had been harassed and beaten by Islamic students on a regular basis during the first half of 1996 and that they had forced him not to renew his UGET membership. When questioned about why he did not put this information in his PIF, the applicant replied that he was asked to provide his story in 2 pages. The Board stated that it did not accept this explanation. It noted that the applicant only joined the UGET on December 7, 1996, which post-dates the above harassing incidents.
