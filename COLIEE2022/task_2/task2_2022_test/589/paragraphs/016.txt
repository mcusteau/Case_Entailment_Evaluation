The applicant also submits that the contradictions between the applicant's written and oral testimony noted by the Board are merely omissions in the PIF that the applicant chose to enlarge upon during oral testimony and not contradictions. The applicant argues that the failure to mention in his PIF that he had been harassed by Islamic students regularly from 1997 to 2000 is not an omission that in any way affects the persecutory events alleged in his PIF. Concerning the applicant's recollection of the exact date of the April 1997 interrogation by police, the applicant notes that he stated in testimony that he was not exactly sure of the date. The applicant submits that the Board's finding of contradictions in the applicant's testimony are not supported by the evidence and are indicative of the Board's bad faith.
