The H & C Application, which was filed less than three months ago, indicated that the Wife had long-term employment as a secretary and, although then on maternity benefits, planned to return to work. However, the H & C Application also indicated that the Applicant was the main economic provider for the family and that, if his Wife were forced to look after the children alone, they would suffer "material deprivation." In stark contrast, the affidavits filed for this proceeding paint a picture of the Wife not working, without any job prospects, unable to qualify for welfare (because of an outstanding support commitment from her former husband) and forced to face an itinerant life of destitution with her children.
