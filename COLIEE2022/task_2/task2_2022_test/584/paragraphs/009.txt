In this context, I have been asked to consider the relevance of the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child, GA Res. 44/25, UN GAOR, 20 November 1989 (the "Convention"). I note that the Convention deals with the human rights of children and, to paraphrase, it recognizes in its preamble that, inter alia, childhood is entitled to special care and assistance, the family should be protected as it is the natural environment for the growth and well-being of children and children should grow up in a family environment.
