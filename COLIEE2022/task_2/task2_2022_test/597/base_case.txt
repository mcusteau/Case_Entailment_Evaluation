Background
[1]
Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of a Citizenship judge, dated July 4, 1995, denying the appellant's application for citizenship because he had not fulfilled the residence requirements of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-29 (the
Act
). A citizenship appeal before this court is a trial de novo.
Facts
[2]
The appellant, his wife, three daughters and a mother-in-law were granted landed immigrant status in Canada on May 20, 1992, after entering Canada as refugees on July 25, 1988. The appellant's wife and two of his daughters have obtained Canadian citizenship. His wife works at York University.
[3]
The appellant owns the house in which his family lives in Willowdale.
[4]
Prior to coming to Canada, the appellant was let go from his employment in Greece. In Canada, while waiting for his landed immigrant status, the appellant worked for a marketing company in a job which ended because of the recession.
[5]
The appellant returned to work with a former employer in Yemen two days after he was granted landed immigrant status. The appellant is no longer employed and lives permanently, he states, in Canada. While away from his home in Canada, the appellant lived in various temporary residences.
Decision Of The Citizenship Judge
[6]
The Citizenship judge did not approve the application for citizenship because the appellant's absences from Canada totalled more than 621 days (575 days short of the 1095-day requirement to remain in Canada) in the four years preceding his application. The Citizenship judge held that the applicant failed to demonstrate
that his absences were for temporary purposes
. The Citizenship judge stated that the majority of the appellant's stays in Canada were no more than two weeks at a time. Furthermore, the appellant's absences were due to his own choice to seek employment elsewhere.
Appellant's Submissions
[7]
The appellant submits the Citizenship judge erred by holding that the appellant did not meet the residence requirement, namely, that the appellant's absences were not for short periods and temporary in nature.
[8]
The appellant (a man 65 years of age) submits his absences result from an inability to find employment in Canada suitable to provide for his family.
Statutory Provisions
[9]
Subsection 5(1) of the
Act
concerning residence reads:
"5(1) The Minister shall grant citizenship to any person who
(c) has been lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence, has not ceased since such admission to be a permanent resident pursuant to section 24 of the Immigration Act and has, within the four years immediately preceding the date of his application, accumulated at least three years of residence in Canada."
The Case Law Respecting Residence
[10]
The issue as defined by the case law is whether the appellant has established a residence and kept a pied-à-terre in Canada with the intention to reside here. If the court can find such intention, then temporary periods of physical absence within the three year period are to be counted as periods of residency. The absence from Canada must not be such that it can be considered to have interrupted an established pattern of residence. There must be clear intention to reside in and centralize one's mode of living in Canada throughout the period covered by the citizenship application. The key is the quality of the connection to Canada. The concern is that Canada not be treated as a "flag of convenience".
[11]
Since the term "residency" is not defined by the Act, the courts have interpreted that term in its normal and common usage. In the leading case on residency,
Papadogiorgakis, Re
, [1978] 2 F.C. 208 (T.D.), Associate Chief Justice Thurlow, as he then was, stated the following at pages 213-214:
"It seems to me that the words 'residence' and 'resident' in para. 5(1)(b) of the new
Citizenship Act
are not as strictly limited to actual presence in Canada throughout the period as they were in the former statute but can include, as well, situations in which the person concerned has a place in Canada which is used by him, during the period as a place of abode to a sufficient extent to demonstrate the reality of his residing there during the material period even though he is away from it part of the time. This may not differ much from what is embraced by the exception referred to by the words '(at least usually)' in the reasons of Pratte, J., but in a close case it may be enough to make the difference between success and failure for an applicant. A person with an established home of his own in which he lives does not cease to be resident there when he leaves it for a temporary purpose whether on business or vacation or even to pursue a course of study. The fact of his family remaining there while he is away may lend support for the conclusion that he has not ceased to reside there. The conclusion may be reached, as well, even though the absence may be more or less lengthy. It is also enhanced if he returns there frequently when the opportunity to do so arises. It is, as Rand, J., appears to me to be saying in the passage I have read, 'chiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question'."
[12]
In the case of
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, Madame Justice Reed thoroughly surveyed the jurisprudence concerning residence and summarized the different formulations for determining whether an appellant was resident in Canada, despite a physical absence:
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
[13]
Apart from the
Re Koo
"place-of-living test", Mr. Justice Cullen in
Wang, Re
(1996), 112 F.T.R. 73 (T.D.), identified at p. 76, four other formulations for determining residence:
"Under the 'reason test', the reason for the appellant's physical absence from Canada is considered. If the absence was temporary and involuntary in nature -- such as caring for a sick relative or attending school abroad -- the appeal is usually allowed. Pursuant to the 'intention test', the court must determine whether the appellant has demonstrated the intention to establish and maintain a home in Canada. The court has also used a 'three-part test': the appellant must have established a residence in Canada, maintained a pied-à-terre in Canada, and intended to reside in Canada. Finally, the court has referred to the 'indicia of residency' and the 'quality of attachment', noting that the stricter test, the quality of attachment, is gaining strength."
[14]
Lastly, although good character is relevant, only one decision,
Chan (A.C.W.), Re
(1993), 70 F.T.R. 171 (T.D.), has allowed an appeal on the grounds that the appellant was "precisely the kind of individual that Canada needs".
Conclusion
[15]
The appellant gave evidence on his own behalf. He stated that, although he left Canada soon after obtaining his landed immigrant status and he was gone for a lengthy period of time, it was only a temporary situation in that his employment in Yemen was for one specific project which has since been completed. He stated that now that this project has been completed he has no further intention of leaving Canada.
[16]
Applying the test as stated by Madame Justice Reed in the case of
Re Koo
(supra), I am satisfied that the appellant was present in Canada for a long period before leaving Canada from July 25, 1988 to May 22, 1992, has his family in Canada, has always had the intention living in Canada and his absences were of a temporary nature.
[17]
For these reasons the appeal is allowed and it is recommended that the appellant be granted Canadian citizenship.
Appeal allowed.
