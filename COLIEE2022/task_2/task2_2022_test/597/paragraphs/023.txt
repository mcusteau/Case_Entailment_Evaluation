Lastly, the appellant's opening of a small Canadian office of the family business (Valles Steamship (Canada) Ltd.) must be commented upon. The appellant expressed a desire to move the head office of the parent company to Vancouver. He also noted that the recent changes in the tax laws would make that a more viable course of action. At the same time, it is clear from the appellant's evidence that business considerations must dictate the primary location of that business. It would be unreasonable to expect that it would be otherwise. In my view, the intention to move the entire Valles Steamship Company Ltd. to Vancouver is, at present, speculative and lacking in what I would call firm resolve. It cannot be used to characterize the appellant's absences from Canada as clearly temporary in nature. From his point of view that is indeed unfortunate.
