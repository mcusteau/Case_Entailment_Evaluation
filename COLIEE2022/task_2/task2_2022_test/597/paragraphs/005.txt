Re Lee
(1988), 24 F.T.R. 188, at p. 196, the test was expressed to be whether the applicant had "
demonstrated his intention
to establish and maintain his home in a given place in Canada?" (underlining added) and:
"Parliament intended that the applicant for citizenship demonstrate that he or she has actually resided among Canadians and in effect thrown in his or her lot with us in some Canadian community ...
"The purpose of the residence provisions is to ensure that the would-be citizen takes the full opportunity - in a vernacular word - to 'Canadianize' himself or herself. ... Those without means or of too modest a fortune to travel outside of Canada for extended periods must perforce comply with Parliament's specifically stated purpose; so, also, must those of sufficient means and an extensive wealth. The law is to be applied equally to, all without discrimination as to means."
