In assessing the quality of this applicant's connection with this country, by reference to the questions set out above, I note first that his situation is not one in which there has been an extensive period of residence in Canada prior to the more recent extended absences. While his wife has been here long enough to obtain citizenship, it is not possible to say that the family has "roots" here. Some of the appellant's extended family is here, but it is not possible to say that Canada is the main focus of the appellant's family life. The pattern of physical presences in Canada is more consistent with visits to this country rather than demonstrating a return to a place where one "regularly normally and customarily lives." He falls very very far short of the 1095 day requirement of actual residence. The absences are not related to an obviously temporary cause. While the appellant speaks of the possibility of moving the head office of Valles Steamship Company Ltd. to Canada, as I have noted, this is speculative. Insofar as the quality of the appellant's attachment to Canada is concerned, he has acquired many of what I might call the standard indicia, probably on the recommendation of his consultants: property in the form of a residence; a driver's licence; bank accounts; B.C. Medical coverage; a library card (which clearly, he rarely uses); a tennis club membership (which he certainly does not use since he does not play tennis). Despite these formal indicia of connection to Canada, I have not been persuaded that the quality of the appellant's residence in Canada is more substantial than the quality of his residence in Hong Kong. I cannot conclude that the quality of that residence demonstrates that Canada is the place where he regularly, normally and customarily resides. Thus, I reach the same conclusion as that reached by the citizenship judge, that the appellant has not fulfilled the 1095 day residence requirement of the
Citizenship Act
. The appellant is clearly caught in a "catch 22" situation. He wishes to acquire Canadian citizenship but the requirements of doing so mean that he would have to give up or at least relinquish his involvement for a certain period of time in a very substantial business enterprise of which he is the chief executive officer.
