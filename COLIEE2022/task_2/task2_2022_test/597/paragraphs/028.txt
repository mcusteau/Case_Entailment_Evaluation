[28]
In the present case, the activities in which the appellant engaged, which are argued to constitute "exceptional value to Canada", are not appreciably different from those in which many businessmen involve themselves for the sake of making and cementing useful business contacts and opportunities. Obtaining concessions from government in order to make the tax and the governmental regulatory features of the business environment more favourable for their endeavours is not an unusual course of action. While I personally regret the situation in which the appellant finds himself, he does not meet the requirement of the
Act
