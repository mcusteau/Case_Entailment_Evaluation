The appellant was physically present within Canada for a total of 232 days during the four year period preceding his application for citizenship. This total number of days accumulated by a number of short periods of physical presence in Canada. Most of these were of little more than one week duration. At the same time, it is clear from the jurisprudence that actual physical presence within the country is not needed during the whole 1095 days to fulfil the three year residence requirement. In the leading case,
Re Papadogiorgakis
, [1978] 2 F.C. 208, Associate Chief Justice Thurlow said, at pp. 213-214:
"It seems to me that the words 'residence' and 'resident' in para. 5(1)(b) of the new
Citizenship Act
are not as strictly limited to actual presence in Canada throughout the period as they were in the former statute but can include, as well, situations in which the person concerned has a place in Canada which is used by him, during the period as a place of abode to a sufficient extent to demonstrate the reality of his residing there during the material period even though he is away from it part of the time. This may not differ much from what is embraced by the exception referred to by the words '(at least usually)' in the reasons of Pratte, J., but in a close case it may be enough to make the difference between success and failure for an applicant.
"
A person with an established home of his own in which he lives does not cease to be resident there when he leaves it for a temporary purpose whether on business or vacation or even to pursue a course of study
. The fact of his family remaining there while he is away may lend support for the conclusion that he has not ceased to reside there. The conclusion may be reached, as well, even though the absence may be more or less lengthy. It is also enhanced if he returns there frequently when the opportunity to do so arises. It is, as Rand, J., appears to me to be saying in the passage I have read, 'chiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations interests and conveniences at or in the place in question."

case, a student who had been physically present in Canada for only 79 days during the relevant four year period was determined to have fulfilled the residence requirement.
