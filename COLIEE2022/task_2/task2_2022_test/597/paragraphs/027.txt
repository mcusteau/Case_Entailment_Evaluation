In the present case, the citizenship judge did not make a recommendation that the Minister act under s. 5(4). I certainly would not criticize that decision. In the first place, as I have noted, the decision to make such a recommendation is a very discretionary one. Secondly, I personally would feel uncomfortable making such a recommendation myself. While I recognize the difficult position in which the appellant finds himself, this is not appreciably different from that in which many individuals are placed. The law establishes criteria to be met by all regardless of the personal considerations of each. Some individuals necessarily fall on one side of the line drawn by the law. Others fall on the other side. This is the price we pay for having a system which tries to treat people equally.
