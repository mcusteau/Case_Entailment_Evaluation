In
Re Lau
, T-136-91 (February 6, 1992) at p. 1, the appropriate test was expressed to be:
"physical presence ... is not essential, provided the landed immigrant has
established a residence, maintained a pied-à-terre and clearly intends to live in this country
." (underlining added)
and
Re Chien
(1992), 51 F.T.R. 317, at p. 318, this was reiterated:
"The jurisprudence ... has clearly established that physical presence in Canada is not required throughout the period, provided the applicant has
established a residence and kept a pied-à-terre in Canada with the intention to reside in this country
." (underlining added)
In
Re Law
(1992), 56 F.T.R. 10, at p. 14, I found I was unable to treat extended absences from Canada as deemed residence because the applicant:
"had not made Canada
the place where he 'regularly, normally or customarily' lives
." (underlining added)
