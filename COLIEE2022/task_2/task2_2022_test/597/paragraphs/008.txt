[8]
Another principle which was cited to me from the jurisprudence requires comment. In some decisions it has been said that in the case of an applicant:
"... who would very obviously make an excellent citizen the provisions of the
Act
should be given a liberal interpretation so as to make the granting of citizenship to him possible ..."
See, for example,
Re Kleifges
(1978), 84 D.L.R.(3d) 183 (F.C.T.D.) at p. 189.
