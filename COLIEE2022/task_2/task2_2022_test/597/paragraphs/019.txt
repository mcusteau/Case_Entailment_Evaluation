The appellant explains that his frequent absences from Canada are necessary so that he can look after the interests of the family company, the Valles Steamship Company Ltd., the head office of which is located in Hong Kong. This company is a multi-million dollar shipping company and while the appellant's father is Chairman of the Board of Directors, it is the appellant who looks after much of the operation of the company on a day to day basis. In addition, during the 1988-1991 period, the appellant was Deputy Chairman and then Chairman of the Hong Kong Shipowners Association. This also required his presence in Hong Kong. He had been involved with that organization since 1971. He retired from his position as Chairman in December 1991.
