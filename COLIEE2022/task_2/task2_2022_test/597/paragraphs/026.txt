Some judges feel uncomfortable making recommendations of the kind in question because they know that the ultimate decision rests with the executive branch of government. If their recommendation is ignored, they know that their considered and objective judgment has been brushed aside. Other judges are less reticent about make recommendations to the executive even though they know that in a great many cases, those recommendations will go unheeded. Given that the making of a recommendation is so highly discretionary, I am not convinced that the failure to make one is properly the subject of an appeal.
