The Respondent argues that the Applicant should provide affidavits from those witnesses who were not interviewed and who are alleged to have important evidence, setting out what that evidence is so that the Court can make up its own mind as to how important the evidence might be. No authority was cited for this proposition. It appears that cases such as
Sketchly
,
Sanderson
and
Public Service Alliance
, supra, as well as others such as
Tahmourpour v. Canada (Solicitor General)
(2005), 332 N.R. 60; 2005 FCA 113 all dealt with such matters on the basis of the evidence in the record and not on the basis of new affidavit evidence filed with the Court.
