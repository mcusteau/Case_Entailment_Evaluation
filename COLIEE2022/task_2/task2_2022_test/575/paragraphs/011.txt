The Commission then issued a letter dated February 9, 2007 which is the decision under review. That letter appears to be a standard form letter and is very perfunctory. It states:
"I am writing to inform you of the decision taken by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in your complaint (20021149) against Canada Customs and Revenue Agency.
"Before rendering its decision, the Commission reviewed the report disclosed to you previously and any submission(s) filed in response to the report. After examining this information, the Commission decided, pursuant to subsection 41(1) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
, to deal with the complaint because
- the Commission is not satisfied that the grievance process adequately and fully addressed the allegation of discrimination.
"The Commission also decided, pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
, to dismiss the complaint because
- the evidence shows that the respondent accommodated the complainant's disabilities in a reasonably timely manner.
"Accordingly, the file on this matter has now been closed."
