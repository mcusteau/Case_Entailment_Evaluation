As to the standard of review, since the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
New Brunswick (Board of Management) v. Dunsmuir
(2008), 372 N.R. 1; 329 N.B.R.(2d) 1; 844 A.P.R. 1; 2008 SCC 9, there have been established two criteria, that of correctness in respect of legal issues and that of reasonableness in respect of factual and discretionary matters, with differing degrees of deference given in respect of reasonableness considering the expertise of the decision maker and other relevant matters. Where there has been a lack of procedural fairness, lack of natural justice or breach of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
such criteria are not the appropriate consideration for, if such a lack or breach has been demonstrated, the decision must be set aside.
