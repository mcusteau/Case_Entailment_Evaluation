Third, a number of other witnesses were also listed by the Applicant as important. It is acknowledged that an investigator has no duty to interview every witness named by a complainant if there is no relevant evidence to be gained or other good reason not to do so.

In this category of witnesses who possibly could offer useful evidence are Mr. Julian the Applicant's team leader and Ms. Corderro the Applicant's union steward.
