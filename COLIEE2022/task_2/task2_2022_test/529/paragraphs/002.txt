Under s. 11.4(2) of the
Immigration Regulations
in force on July 4, 1996, the applicant was deemed to have submitted an application for landing as a member of the Post-Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada Class (PDRCC) to an immigration officer on that day. At that time the definition of member of the PDRCC did not exclude persons referred in section F of article I of the Convention. The applicant sought judicial review and leave was granted. On May 1, 1997, before the judicial review was heard and determined, the
Immigration Regulations
were amended to exclude from the definition of member of the PDRCC an individual who, as a result of a determination by the Refugee Division, is considered to be a person referred to in section F of Article 1. (See
