Cullen, J.
: The defendant, William S. McGregor, is the registered and beneficial owner of the ship "Manitou III" (hereinafter the Vessel) and the defendant Barry McGregor (B. McGregor) is a commercial fisherman and at all material times was the master and operator of the Vessel. The plaintiff, Daniel Lundberg (hereinafter the plaintiff), was at all material times a commercial fisherman.
Issues
[2]
The plaintiff alleges that by an oral agreement made during the 1986 halibut and salmon fisheries between the plaintiff and B. McGregor for himself and on behalf of D.W. McGregor, it was agreed that in consideration of the plaintiff providing his services to assist in the preparation of the Vessel for the 1987 herring fishery, salmon fishery and halibut fishery (the 1987 fisheries) and to subsequently serve aboard the Vessel as a fisherman and crew member during the 1987 fisheries to the exclusion of any other vessel or operator, the plaintiff would be entitled to a certain percentage of the value of catches in the various 1987 fisheries.
[3]
The defendants, for their part, respond as follows in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement of defence:
"3. The plaintiff served aboard the 'Manitou III' first as an inbreaker then as a regular member of the crew for a number of fishing ventures or trips during 1986 but in each and every case in which he served as a crew member he did so on the basis of an agreement between co-adventurers, being the owner, master and crew for the particular trip, on the usual terms, that is to say that the service would be for the complete trip including all preparatory work and the remuneration therefor would be a share of the catch of that trip according to the formula agreed between the participating co-adventurers.
"4. It was not part of any of the aforesaid agreements that the plaintiff would be entitled to perpetual service aboard the 'Manitou III' or any future service. The plaintiff's future service aboard the 'Manitou III' was subject to agreement being reached to that effect by all participating co-adventurers, and no such agreement was reached in 1986 with respect to any particular fishing trips in 1987."
[4]
The defendants have also filed a counterclaim which reads in paragraph 12 as follows:
"12. By reason of the plaintiff's breach of contract set out in paragraphs 10 and 11 herein, the defendants suffered loss and damage in that the 'Manitou III' was unable to participate in the last opening of the herring season and lost all expected profits thereby and, further, the defendant Barry McGregor suffered loss and damage in that he had to bring the vessel down the entire length of the coast of British Columbia to Vancouver alone without the plaintiff's assistance."
and for this they seek general damages for lost profits during the 1989 herring fishery; general damages consequent upon the plaintiff's failure to assist in bringing the "Manitou III" back to hope port; and interest and costs.
[5]
In summary then, the plaintiff makes two claims, namely:
(1) for the breach of the oral agreement wherein the plaintiff was to be included as a crew member on board the Vessel during the 1987 herring fishery; and
(2) for the breach of the oral agreement for failing to properly and seriously pursue the 1987 salmon fishery.
[6]
With respect to (1) above, (a) was there an oral agreement that the plaintiff would be a crew member of the Vessel for the 1987 herring fishery, (b) was there a breach by S. McGregor and if a breach (c) what damages flow?
[7]
With regard to (2) above was it (a) a term of the oral agreement with respect to the 1987 salmon fishery that the fishery would be properly and seriously pursued, i.e., was that fishing venture going to be properly prosecuted, (b) was there a breach of the said agreement and if a breach (c) what damages flow, and how should they be assessed?
[8]
The defendant denies any such agreement was made during the 1986 fishery and counterclaims that the plaintiff was guilty of a breach of contract that required him to serve the entire season or until the Vessel returned to home port or would give reasonable notice before quitting, whereby the defendant suffered loss and damage in that the Vessel was unable to participate in the last opening of the herring season and lost all the expected profits thereby, plus loss and damage in that he had to bring the Vessel down the entire length of the coast of British Columbia alone, without the plaintiff's assistance.
The Evidence
[9]
The plaintiff called the following witnesses:
1. Himself;
2. Alfie Flotvik (Flotvik), a fellow crew member in 1986;
3. F.D. Johnson (Johnson), a pool member with the defendant B. McGregor;
4. Joady Pudwell (Pudwell), a crew member with the plaintiff on the 1987 salmon fishery;
5. James H. Bjering (Bjering), employed by the Federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
[10]
The defendant gave evidence himself and called Paul Wilson (Wilson), a crew member in 1987 on the "Pathfinder III" owned by Ed Johnson.
[11]
In some respects there is no real conflict in the evidence about the 1986 halibut and salmon fisheries per se. The plaintiff, as early as age nine, had gone with his father on his father's boat to fish salmon and only salmon. It is acknowledged that he became proficient in this skill but according to his evidence he wanted to fish both herring and halibut, and become experienced at that which would lead of course to earning more money. His father contacted B. McGregor and the plaintiff was hired to work on the Vessel. During the 1986 halibut and salmon fisheries he worked as an inbreaker (greenhorn) vis-Ã -vis halibut but had skills and experience to offer on the salmon fishery. The 1986 crew of the Vessel was B. McGregor, skipper, Flotvik, Albert Armstrong (Armstrong) and the plaintiff.
[12]
The Vessel was about 43 feet long and slept four. It had a freezer capacity of 14,000 pounds. It is referred to as "a freezer troller with a halibut licence" (Transcript, p. 19). The Vessel can be distinguished from a gill netter or a seiner in that "when we're trolling, we're dragging hooks through the water, whereas a gill setter or seine boat is using a net to catch fish" (Transcript, p. 19). The usual crew is three for salmon (or at least it was in 1986), halibut had four but with herring there are several variables. Page 21 of Transcript:
"A.	Well, I was saying, it's quite a variable, depending on how many licences you have and where you're going to fish. It's no
strict number
, but basically you could fish a punt, a herring punt, with two men or go with four. It's up to the skipper or whatever he would decide.
Q.	I take it that varies depending on pooling arrangements, is that fair to say?
A.	Yes, of that also, yes, sure." (Emphasis added)
[13]
The most important and influential member of the crew is the skipper, in this case B. McGregor. It is clear that the skipper picks the crew, decides when to leave, where to go, how long to fish an area, when to move on to another spot and when to return to port. He is responsible for the crew's safety and although other crew members may be capable of handling the Vessel, insurance coverage is only on the skipper, preventing uninsured crew members from being permitted to handle the Vessel. Because pooling is a partnership agreement, each party has an interest in the ability of crew members - both on their own craft and others - to perform well because the size of the catch determines the money earned by all. The makeup of the crew is a subject discussed before the pooling arrangement is agreed to. A pooling partner with more licences than the other members can have greater influence on crews, when to fish, where, when to move on and when to return to port, because he has, after all, the largest financial stake in the outcome. Incidentially, the pooling arrangement determines, before starting, the percentage each party is to receive from the catch.
Oral Agreement
[14]
The norm in fishing for herring, halibut and salmon is that the agreements are all oral, with little if anything written out. The catch is sold on return to port, the percentage calculated, and then paid - either by the skipper, the vessel owner or the company that buys the catch. There is really not one meeting on board a vessel where next year's crew is determined, what fisheries to take part in and how shares will be allocated. Rather it is the culmination of a series of talks between the crew and the skipper or talks the skipper has with individual crew members. As an example, the defendant knew that Flotvik would probably not be available for the 1987 herring fishery because he was going to work with his brother on his brother's boat. It is a most informal process and works quite well most of the time. I think it is fair to say that skipper and crew pretty well know who will be the crew the following year and what fishery will be pursued.
[15]
Any objective observer of the situation would confirm that B. McGregor's hiring of the plaintiff for the 1986 fishery was mutually beneficial. B. McGregor needed another man for halibut and at that time he had no one set up for salmon fishery. With the plaintiff's experience in salmon fishing it was an opportunity for B. McGregor to have a greenhorn for the halibut fishery and an experienced man on the salmon fishery. From the plaintiff's standpoint he had a job, could learn halibut fishing and use his experience to gain more money in the salmon fishery.
[16]
This 1986 job entailed making up the halibut gear and preparation of the boat. Everything had to be moved to the Vessel, then check all mechanical devices and see to it that there was sufficient fuel and food for the trip. At Port Hardy they were able to get bait. Then it was off to the fishing grounds, to cruise around and determine where to set their gear, after baiting all lines and later they began to pick up the gear. B. McGregor, due to his experience, had other tasks to perform, namely selecting the proper site, when to pick gear and operating the drum. The plaintiff, as a greenhorn, was dependent upon a meeting held by the skipper and other crew members after the trip to determine what his percentage of the catch would be. Again, quite an informal way of doing things. The plaintiff's evidence was: (p. 25 of Transcript):
"A.	Barry was very happy with me. We did very well that year and he was quite happy."
That comment on his ability was never challenged. He received $8,056 for that halibut trip. On another shorter trip that year he received $2,640.81. This was a good fishery and during this time the plaintiff says (p. 28 of Transcript):
"A.	... Back in that halibut there we had done quite well. Barry was quite happy with the crew and everything else and we're always talking about, you know, the upcoming season, what we're going to do in the salmon, where we're going to go, wherever else. And herring starts getting talked about.
The Court: Mr. Lundberg, when you say 'we', I have to know -- it's one thing for we, 		the crew, to talk; it's another thing for we, Barry and I, to talk; it's another thing for we, Barry and the other members, so I have to know who you're talking to.
A.	Okay, I'm sorry. When I say we I mean the whole crew, Barry McGregor, Alfie Flotvik, and Albert Armstrong. We were speaking about the up and coming salmon, herring, whatever.
At that time Barry promised me a job on the herring
.
Q.	Which herring are you referring to?
A.	The following, coming season, which would be '87." (Emphasis added)
Lending credibility to that conclusion was his follow-up at p. 28:
"Q.	Do you recall what the wording of those discussions were?
A.	Well, no, not word for word, no. Basically Alfie Flotvik had a job with his brother at that time.
Q.	For what?
A.	For herring in '87 which would mean that Barry had me and Albert -- Barry McGregor would have me and Albert Armstrong for herring crew, two men, at least.
Q.	What did you conclude from those discussions?
A.	Well, after speaking about this several times, not just on the halibut but throughout the salmon also with Barry, that I definitely concluded I would be going herring fishing and there was no doubt in my mind that I had a job and I would be there.
Q.	Which fishery? You're referring to the 1987 herring fishery?
A.	That's correct, yeah."
[17]
So, self-serving or not, that was the plaintiff's sworn testimony on the oral agreement as he saw it. Later, when asked if during the 1986 salmon fishery they discussed the 1987 herring fishery, the plaintiff said (p. 30 of Transcript):
"A.	Yeah, basically, you know, the same conversation went over with myself, Barry McGregor, Alfie, whatever. You know, what your game plan is. You know, you're just sort of throwing things in the air. Where would you like to go? You know, maybe you want to change your net a little bit different than what you had the previous year. Different things, you know. You might want a new outboard, you might want to change your skiff, you know, that kind of talk."
[18]
Although the plaintiff clearly enunciated he would be a greenhorn on the 1987 fishery he claims he was never told by B. McGregor that he didn't want any greenhorn on the 1987 herring fishery.
[19]
With the end of the salmon fishery, the season for fishing generally ends, unless there is a following halibut trip. When over, "you, you know, get the boat winterized and clean things up and go home until the herring season the following March". The plaintiff was asked if, during this break, he had any contact at all with Barry McGregor (p. 34 of Transcript):
"A.	Yes, on several times I had, yeah.
Q.	And what sort of contact?
A.	Well, I would always, you know, drop down, have a coffee with him, whatever. Chat him up to see what's going on and before Christmas I was asking him: well, what's the deal in the herring, when do you want to get going with nets and get everything going? And I was told that: this is a ways away yet, don't worry about it. You know, enjoy the holidays and have a good New Year and we'll see you after that. So I believe it was shortly after the New Year I was back down at Barry's place and asking the same questions: when would he like to get moving on these things?
Q.	What do you mean by 'moving on these things'?
A.	Well, start getting nets prepared. You know, making sure outboards were running properly, power packs, whatever. You know, all the things you have to do to be prepared to fish.
Q.	And when you say 'fish' you're talking about the 1987 herring fishery.
A.	'87 herring, yeah. So I was told: well, don't worry about it. There's lots of time. It only takes a few days to put all this stuff together and we can go. ... You know, he's the man calling the shots, so I went along with that, but still I was kept going -- you know, time kept going by and I knew that, you know, time was running out. I kept on going back there every three, four days.
Q.	Going back where?
A.	Back to Barry McGregor's house in Langley and you know, inquiring: when do you want to get going with the preparation work?"
He also advises he talked to B. McGregor on the phone several times and got the same response. And later (p. 36 of Transcript):
"Q.	Okay. What did you conclude from those conversations that you had with Mr. McGregor?
A.	Well, the only conclusion I could have was that I definitely
still
had the job. I was going herring fishing. It was just a matter of when we were going.
Q.	Were you ever told, up to the commencement of the fishery, that you weren't going?
A.	No, never.
Q.	Did Mr. McGregor ever indicate to you in any way that you weren't going?
A.	No way, shape, or form was I ever given the inclination that I wouldn't be going."
[20]
While working on his father's boat, only five minutes away from B. McGregor's boat, the plaintiff decided to go over and see what was going on. What he found out was (p. 37 of Transcript):
"I see the crew is down there and they've got everything thrown together and I'm told that they're leaving that day.
Q.	Who were you told that by?
A.	I was speaking to Brian Hoffner, Alfie Flotvik, and Albert Armstrong that particular day.
Q.	Okay. Did you talk with Mr. McGregor that day?
A.	No, I didn't. I recall I phoned him earlier that morning. There was no answer. ... I would like to have spoken to him but having worked with Barry previously before this, I knew that his idea of being there in three or four hours could have meant the next day, so if he needed me or had to contact me he knew my number, and that's the way I looked at it. I was kind of choked up about it but --"
[21]
Later, the plaintiff worked for B. McGregor in 1987 halibut and salmon fisheries. He'd been called to help get the skiffs out of the water and transport them. Skiffs are used to fish herring. The plaintiff states he raised the 1987 herring fishery with B. McGregor (p. 39 of Transcript):
"Q.	Did you, prior to or at that time after the herring fishery, discuss with Mr. McGregor the herring fishery and why you weren't along?
A.	Yeah, well, you know, it was -- I let him know that I wasn't too thrilled about not being part of the crew and he apologized and said: yeah, that's too bad, I wish you were, but you know, it was all done by then. You couldn't turn back the time, so that's what happened and that's the way it went."
[22]
The 1986 halibut trip was successful according to the plaintiff. All the preparatory work performed by the plaintiff in 1987 was for halibut fishery, save and except removing the skiffs and transporting them. The crew for the salmon fishery in 1987 was the plaintiff, Powell, "a young kid", B. McGregor as skipper who took along his five year old son.
[23]
The initial plan, as understood by the plaintiff, was that they would leave on day one, July 1st, because the salmon fishery in 1986 had not been a good one. If you get the jump on the others, you catch more fish. The plaintiff had no quarrel with going "to the Charlottes". Work was done at first by the plaintiff and later with help from Powell preparing the Vessel for the salmon fishery. Most of the preparation work was done in June and the plaintiff took off for a few days holiday. The Vessel left port sometime in the first week in August. Why? The plaintiff states at pp. 47-48 of the transcript:
"A.	Well, basically it comes down to the fact that Barry, he's already done fairly well with the herring and the halibut previously in that spring, and he does not like salmon fishing. It's a long drawn out affair and with long hours, which -- you know, halibut and herring are short and sweet, where you can make some good bucks, but salmon, like I say, it can be a long grind. So he's not big on salmon fishing. And also he had quite a drinking problem also, which didn't help us in the effort of leaving the dock. And I think at that time he was served with divorce papers from his ex-wife."
[24]
They fished around the north tip of Vancouver Island and never went to the Charlottes. They only fished eight to ten "short" days (eight hours). Basically the plaintiff wrote off that trip and was looking forward to a halibut trip.
[25]
In 1988 the plaintiff went herring fishing with B. McGregor. There were seven crew in the pool but four on the Vessel, namely: B. McGregor, Brian Hoffner, Brian Malloy and the plaintiff. This work included preparing the Vessel for the trip, save and except the nets which were made by another party. The Vessel fished in the areas allowed by their licences and about the second or third week of March the crew was in Rupert, where a licence allowed them to fish. B. McGregor left for Vancouver to attend a discovery session with respect to his divorce. The three remaining crew members were not able to take charge of the Vessel because they were not insured. B. McGregor, however, did arrange for a person named Gene Hadley (Hadley) who was in the same pool but on another vessel, to come over and run the Vessel. An altercation between Hadley and crew member Brian Malloy resulted in Hadley going back to his other boat and left the Vessel with no one to run it, i.e., no insurance coverage. There was a two hour opening for herring and they missed it.
[26]
According to the plaintiff he sat down and did some thinking about his experiences to-date with B. McGregor. He felt he had missed the 1987 herring season promised to him. Then he missed most of the 1987 salmon season and now the tail end of the 1988 herring season. He was pretty "fed up". At p. 69 of transcript he states:
"I could see where it was a no win situation working with Barry. ... Between the drinking and the missed fishing and everything else, that was it."
He simply left - did not bring the Vessel back. "But there was four other guys there, or three ... that were part of our pool that, as far as I was concerned, shouldn't have no problem one of them jumping on the boat and helping Barry out.
I mean that's what a pool is all about, really
." (Emphasis added) (p. 70 of Transcript).
[27]
On cross-examination the plaintiff described what he saw as the optimum situation for owner, skipper and crew (p. 71 of Transcript):
"Q.	So you would say that -- if you disagree with that, would you say that the fishery goes year by year then?
A.	It depends. You know, in a working situation you got a group of men confined on a boat and you're all working for the same common goal, you know, you want to catch as much as possible and do well, right. Basically, if everybody gets along and everybody is happy there's no reason to change crew. I mean if everybody -- you know, if things work out, hey, it's great. And that's the way it usually works. People work out and they're happy with the boat owner and the boat owner is happy with them and they continue on.
It would be rather silly to really start shopping for crews everytime the fishery ends. I mean, can you imagine all these captains running around the coast looking for deck hands? I mean, it just doesn't even make sense."
[28]
The plaintiff concedes that one just cannot jump ship at any time. If hired for the season that's really what it means, and it includes preparation for each trip and also the work that must be done at the end of the season. With the 1986 halibut fishery, the plaintiff was an inbreaker, really on probation and even his wages or cut was decided
after
the trip rather than the customary way of deciding before leaving port. He got less than others - certainly to be expected. But, he knew B. McGregor was pleased with his work and so were the crew, and he was hired for the halibut season in 1987. Drinking by B. McGregor did not affect the halibut or herring fishery according to the plaintiff.
[29]
In 1987 the plaintiff helped prepare the Vessel for the salmon fishery which included painting "out of the water on the ways at Trites". This work followed the halibut fishery, and "between halibut trips it was normal to go to Vancouver". The plaintiff could not go with the Vessel to the United States due to a conviction there and was dropped off at Steveston, conceding on cross-examination that "it was at the end of June that year that that second halibut season ended" and that's when he was put off at Steveston.
[30]
It is clear both from the cross-examination of the plaintiff and the evidence of B. McGregor that a good deal of repair work was required to be done on the Vessel before it would be seaworthy enough to engage in the salmon fishery. Possibly pressing the people who performed the repair work and a more diligent effort by B. McGregor might have resulted in a more expeditious repair programme but everyone, including the plaintiff, knew that B. McGregor did not like salmon fishing and he had already had a most successful 1987 herring and halibut season. The plaintiff also knew that the Vessel was in Trites during the month of July and that July is a busy time for repairing ships. Once on the water, some time in early August, the Vessel took about 24 hours to reach Port Hardy, and from Port Hardy then across to Queen Charlotte Sound. Starting out late, and then expecting a halibut run, the skipper decided not to make the trip across to the Charlottes. His reasoning was agreed to by the plaintiff. At pp. 88-89, he states:
"Q.	So, from Port Hardy, one would then proceed out across Queen Charlotte Sound to the Queen Charlotte Islands, correct?
A.	If that was your plan and everything looked all right, sure, that's what you would do. But the circumstances were different in our situation there, given to the fact that it was so late in the season and the fact we had a halibut trip to go on two weeks later and all the gear is in Vancouver and,
like I said, there's nothing to say when you get to the Queen Charlotte Islands you're going to do better than where you are
." (Emphasis added)
[31]
The plaintiff maintained all the way through that with the late start it was a write-off and "they" were looking forward to the halibut fishery. At p. 89 of the transcript he says:
"Q.	So, the fact that all the halibut gear was in Vancouver was a consideration?
A.	Well, it had to be. I mean, it was just a matter of driving it up to Port Hardy but it had to be done, you know, to go halibut fishing."
[32]
Counsel for the defendant drove home the point about safety of the crew at p. 90 of the transcript:
"Q.	Mr. Lundberg, in your opinion, is it the master's duty to be responsible for the safety of the vessel?
A.	Oh, for sure. Definitely.
Q.	He is responsible for the safety of his crew?
A.	That's right.
Q.	And therefore it's in the master's discretion whether he puts his vessel to sea or not?
A.	That's true.
Q.	And weather would be one of the things that he would consider in exercising that discretion.
A.	Definitely, yeah."
Also, the point was made that one is paid a percentage share of the catch and not paid for preparing the boat for a trip. At p. 91 of the transcript:
"A.	What I'm paid, yeah. It's a percentage of the catch, yeah.
Q.	And you're not paid for preparing the boat for the trip?
A.	I was not paid by Barry for preparing the boat and neither do we have an agreement to pay me for the preparation of the boat. I have, in other cases, been paid for preparation of boats, but not with Barry McGregor, no.
Q.	So, your agreement to be paid by a percentage of the catch of the fish included the agreement by you to prepare the vessel for that fishery?
A.	Yeah.
Q.	And it included agreement by you to stay until the end of the fishery?
A.	Yes, that's right."
[33]
Several exigencies had to be accepted by the plaintiff and they were outlined to him. The skipper made all the decisions; he left when he decided, fished where he decided, and returned when he decided. It is possible to have a "hole" trip where no catch is made. "I knew the kid was only going to be there a week or ten days, whatever it would have been, and you know,
you just live with it
." (P. 96 of transcript) (Emphasis added).
[34]
That was really the plaintiff's philosophy throughout, and particularly regarding the 1987 halibut and salmon fishery. By 1988, he decided not to live with it and left.
[35]
However, there was no equivocation in responding to cross-examination (pp. 102-108 of the transcript):
"Q.	Alfie Flotvik, in addition to having experience on the herring, had been hired previous to you, had he not, in the halibut?
A.	Yeah. He was hired the day before me.
Q.	So he had seniority to you on the 'Manitou III'?
A.	Yeah, a matter of a good 15/16 hours I would think.
Q.	It might have gone the other way. Did you anticipate being hired by the pool?
A.	Well, no, I didn't even know the pool existed. As far as I was concerned, Barry gave me the job and that was that. I had no idea what the pool was or who was in it or whatever. All I figured that me and Albert, anyways, were hired by Barry McGregor and we would be going herring fishing and whoever else came along that was fine with me. That's about all I knew.
Q.	And you say that you were guaranteed the job on the herring?
A.	Yeah. The way the conversations went and everything was -- how everything went down there, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going."
And later, at p. 110:
"Q.	But you agree that Mr. McGregor couldn't tell, prior to receiving his licences, how many crew he'd need?
A.	Well, that's not totally true. I mean Barry owns himself, outright, two licenses and you know, you can either put two guys in the skiff or you can put four guys. I mean it was already set that me and Albert were going to fish together in one skiff anyways, so.
Q.	Did Mr. McGregor ever tell you why he didn't take you on the herring?
A.	Not in so many words. ... but, basically, I think that he wanted Brian Hoffner along because Brian is an experienced man and he wanted Brian Hadley along because Brian was in a group that I think Barry wanted to get into, you know, for the salmon, eh, a group of fishermen that Barry wanted to get into, so as far as I know, that would be the reasons that these fellows went instead of myself."
[36]
Flotvik corroborates the plaintiff's evidence about the fact that future fisheries, particularly herring, were discussed by Barry McGregor and the crew. At pp. 127-128 of the transcript he says:
"Q.	Do you recall any discussions during that halibut fishery with respect to future fisheries?
A.	Yes, I do. We talked -- well, we talked that we were going salmon fishing with -- Dan Lundberg had got a job. We were going salmon fishing together there and we did our halibut trip and we had also talked, like doing our herring for the next year, eh.
Q.	Okay. When you say 'we', who do you mean by we?
A.	Well, I talked to, like with Barry McGregor, Albert Armstrong, you know, myself and that, we talked about what we were -- what to prepare and what we were doing for the herring and stuff like that.
. . . . .
Q.	Did you discuss at all who was going to be on that herring crew?
A.	Yes, we did, yeah.
Q.	And what were those discussions?
A.	It was like -- Albert Armstrong, he was coming, and then there was Dan Lundberg also, he had a job on the herring with us.
Q.	Okay. Was it common when you were aboard the 'Manitou III' with Mr. McGregor to talk about future fisheries?
A.	Yeah, yeah. We talked about different fisheries.
Most crews do, you know
.
. . . . .
Q.	Okay. And I take it you were ultimately a crew member aboard the 'Manitou III' for the 1987 herring fishery?
A.	Yes.
Q.	And was Mr. Lundberg with you during that fishery?
A.	For the herring no. He never come. He had lost his job.
Q.	Did you know why he had lost his job?
A.	I do not know why he lost his job. He did have a job but it was the last moment all of a sudden, no, he did not have a job." (Emphasis added)
[37]
Flotvik made $9,000 on the herring in 1987. "Some guys made a lot less." Flotvik described himself as an inbreaker on herring, but every one else was pretty well an experienced fisherman. At p. 130 of the transcript Flotvik states:
"A.	... There was, like I say, Dan Lundberg would have been an inbreaker but he didn't get to come."
Flotvik was surprised on two counts: that the plaintiff said he had taken his job and second, that the plaintiff was not on the herring fishery in 1987. At p. 131 of the transcript, he states:
"Q.	Would it surprise you to hear that Mr. Lundberg says that you took his place on the herring?
A.	That I took his place? Jeez, I don't really --
I thought we were all going
, you know. We had talked and I had a job there. Yeah. I don't think I took his job, no." (Emphasis added)
And finally, at p. 133 of the transcript Flotvik states:
"The Court: And what about the other fellow?
A.	Well, the other fellow, like Dan, he came on the halibut with us, you know, and also on the salmon, which he's a good salmon fisherman, so that's why he was there, you know. And then on the herring, well, he just -- I knew he had a job up to then and when it was time to leave; he didn't have a job. You know, it was just like no, I'm sorry, you don't have a job now, you can't come. It was kind of like that. It was a shock to quite a few of us, you know, like Albert, myself, and a couple of other deck hands on the other boats."

Joyal, J.'s decision in
Mark Fishing Co. Ltd. v. Northern Princess Seafood Ltd.
(1991), 38 F.T.R. 299, is of assistance in terms of outlining general principles of contract law as they apply to oral agreements. That case differs from the one before me as it involved a contract for the sale of a ship which was negotiated orally. However, the principles apply equally to the case before me. At page 303 of the
Mark
decision, Joyal, J., stated:
"Contracts for the sale of ships are governed by the ordinary rules of contract law and do not require to be executed in any particular form and order to be valid. Rather, what is necessary to the existence of a contract is 'a clear agreement on all essential terms', as these words are found in Wilford, Coghlin & Kimball,
Times Charters
(3rd Ed.) London: Lloyd's of London Press Ltd., 1989, p. 21."
[39]
Further, there is no dispute that
the question of whether a binding oral agreement has been concluded will depend on the circumstances of each particular case
, (
Mark Fishing
305, emphasis added). The test, as enunciated by Joyal, J., in
Mark Fishing
at page 308 is set out below:
"Nevertheless, the true test of any oral agreement being concluded is not whether either of the parties to it subsequently be suspected of keeping all possible technical options open, but whether on more objective evidence or conclusions drawn therefrom, a valid contract enforceable at law was previously formed."
After reviewing the evidence I have to be satisfied that it was the parties' intention to create a binding agreement. Also, whenever we are dealing with intention, an objective test must be applied. Therefore, in order to bring a contract into existence there must be a communication of the parties intention by means of an outward expression. It is necessary not only to show an intention in the party to be charged to agree, but also to show an expression of that intention: G.H.L. Friedman,
The Law of Contract in Canada
(2nd Ed. Toronto: Carswell, 1986) page 15. As noted by Lord Denning in
Storer v. Manchester City Council
, [1974] 3 All E.R. 824, at 828:
"In contracts you do not look into the actual intent in a man's mind. You look at what he said and did. A contract is formed when there is, to all outward appearances, a contract. A man cannot get out of a contract by saying: 'I did not intend to contract' if by his words he has done so. His intention is to be found only in the outward expression which his letters convey. If they show a concluded contract that is enough."
[40]
Further, the onus rests on the party asserting the oral agreement, the plaintiff in this case, to satisfy the court on a balance of probabilities that such an intention to conclude an oral agreement existed:
AFRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED. In the
Arctic Rentals
case, the plaintiff claimed that funding for a building/training project was approved in an oral telephone conversation between the plaintiff and an acting manager of a Canada Manpower Centre. The plaintiff commenced an action against the Crown on the basis of an alleged oral contract. Strayer, J., was unable to conclude from looking at all the surrounding circumstances that the parties had any intention to enter into a legally binding contract. The facts showed that there could not have been a serious intention on the part of either party that during the alleged conversation Mr. Keto was committing the government to pay whatever Arctic Rentals and Oxford House Band might agree by future contracts.
[41]
The principles of contract law require, for a binding agreement to be concluded, that there be an offer and acceptance. Generally, as with intention, offer and acceptance must be viewed objectively. It is also clear that there may be acceptance by conduct. In
Hamilton Gear and Machine Co. Ltd. v. Lewis Bros.
, [1924] 3 D.L.R. 367 (Ont. S.C.A.D.), Mulock, C.J.O., stated:
"It is, I think, the law that if an offer ... does not require acceptance in any particular way, then such conduct by the person to whom it is made, as warrants the inference ... of acceptance ... is equivalent to acceptance. (S.M. Waddams,
The Law of Contracts
(2nd Ed. Toronto: Canada Law Book Inc., 1984) page 70)."
[42]
Another requirement for a binding agreement is consideration. Consideration is said to consist in some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to the one party or some forbearance, detriment, loss or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other or as expressed in other terms: "The principle requisite and that which is the essence of every consideration, is that it should create some benefit to the party or some trouble, prejudice or inconvenience to the party to whom the promise is made. (
The Law of Contract in Canada
, page 75, quoting from
Robertson v. Robertson
(1933), 6 M.P.R. 370, at 389 (N.B.C.A.).
[43]
There must also be some mutuality. A contract must show that both parties are bound in some way. The act or promise of one party must be performed or given in exchange for something actually done or promised by the other.
[44]
When dealing with the question of whether on oral agreement was in fact concluded, one should keep in mind that the principle purpose of the law of contracts is to protect reasonable expectations effected by a promise. As noted by Grange, J., in
Brooklin Heights Homes Ltd. v. Major Holdings & Developments Ltd.
(1977), 80 D.L.R.(3d) 563 (Ont. H.C.J.), at 569-570:
"It follows from this purpose that the law is not so much concerned to carry out the will of the promisor as to protect the expectation of the promise."
[45]
Earlier, I underlined for emphasis the phrase, "the question of whether a binding oral agreement has been concluded will depend on the circumstances of each particular case" (
Mark Fishing
, supra).
[46]
Counsel for the defendant in cross-examination and argument, was endeavouring to make the case that not "all of the conditions of the alleged contact" had been settled. However, this contract only required a commitment by the defendant to hire for the 1987 herring fishery and by the plaintiff not to look elsewhere for work or accept other employment. The unique circumstances in these kinds of contracts is that the fisherman has really contracted to work for the particular skipper and is content to rely on the skipper to make the best deal possible, to fish at the right time and in the right places, namely to maximize all the benefits flowing from the contract of employment. The percentage of the catch is established before setting out, and to further enlarge on this unique feature of these contracts, when the plaintiff was "hired" before the 1986 halibut and salmon fishery, it was left until after the trips for halibut and salmon before his percentage or amount of wage was determined. It could hardly be said he was not employed or there was no oral contract of employment.
[47]
I have dwelt in some detail with the earlier evidence of the plaintiff because my conclusion, after hearing all of the evidence, hearing argument by counsel and reading the transcript, that the plaintiff's evidence is the more credible, has the corroboration of Flotvik, and really describes how future crews are selected for future fisheries. It is all oral, and most of the time it works. There was just too much in B. McGregor's evidence that seemed evasive and, given his drinking problem at that time, his marriage breakdown, his dislike of salmon fishing (except earlier with his father), it is not surprising that his evidence was less than crisp and to the point. He is the only one who tried to suggest that fishermen on the Vessel did not discuss future fisheries and the make-up of crews. I believe he fully intended that the plaintiff would be working on the herring fishery on the Vessel until he found that Brian Hoffner was available, was experienced and was with a group of fishermen that B. McGregor wanted to get into. I don't believe he had the intestinal fortitude to tell the plaintiff about the new arrangement, and did, as the plaintiff says, "string him along".
[48]
It is really no defence to suggest that notwithstanding the licence held, he couldn't have retained the plaintiff. If the plaintiff was an inbreaker it had more to do with technique but the plaintiff was not a greenhorn about fishing, had been out as early as age nine and knew from his experience what made a successful crew - which he had in spades - a willingness to get along with fellow crew members. Any objective person could see the plaintiff as an asset, not a greenhorn and the type of crewman who would be an asset in any pooling arrangement. I am satisfied that an oral agreement was reached that the plaintiff would be hired for the 1987 herring fishery, and that the agreement was broken when B. McGregor opted for a more experienced crew member. The plaintiff had a right to know he was not to be part of the 1987 herring fishery to enable him to make other arrangements. When he finally realized he was not going it was too late to get other employment to enable him to mitigate his damages.
Assessment Of Damage On Claim #1:
[49]
Johnson stated that deck hands earned $9,552 and Flotvik put the amount he earned at $9,000. If the plaintiff had in fact worked then the experienced Hoffner might very well not have worked, thereby substituting an inbreaker for experience where one might expect a smaller catch. If, on the other hand, the plaintiff were hired as an additional employee, the catch would have to be divided by one more person. Also, it is freely conceded by the plaintiff that he had no experience in the herring fishery (although he was a good fisherman and experienced in salmon fishery) whereas Flotvik, also an inbreaker by his own definition, had done herring fishing on other trips, sometime on his brother's boat. I suspect the plaintiff would have received a smaller share and that it would probably have been determined after the herring fishery and would have come from the percentage share of other deck hands whose share had been determined before the fishery commenced. On balance I feel he would have received less than Flotvik and I fix the damage at $6,000 with interest to run from March 30, 1987.
[50]
Counsel for the defendant pointed out that the plaintiff had received unemployment insurance benefits throughout the herring fishery period and the evidence seems to bear that out. For that reason he suggests if any damages are awarded they should be reduced by the total of these unemployment insurance benefits. However, it is my view that this matter should now be examined by the Unemployment Insurance Commission to determine if there has been an overpayment of benefits and if so to repay them accordingly. The plaintiff may voluntarily contact the Unemployment Insurance Commission or, I suppose, can wait for them to move. In any event the total amount of the damages is not to be reduced by any unemployment insurance benefits that may have been received.
Second Oral Agreement?
[51]
I have a great deal of difficulty accepting that there was a
second
oral agreement. The plaintiff alleges that, not only was there a contract of employment, but that the defendant had agreed that "they will go out and prosecute the fishing venture with serious effort". It may have been the hope and even expectation that such a 100 percent effort would be made by the skipper because they had such a poor salmon fishery the year before. I accept B. McGregor's evidence that repairs were essential, that they were being done when the repair season was a busy one, and the person he wanted to do the work was already engaged and they would have to wait until he was able to do the specialty welding. This had the result that other repair jobs had to be delayed, assuring a late departure. The Vessel had already been engaged in a herring fishery and two halibut trips and all concede it is the skipper who decides what repairs are necessary to make the Vessel seaworthy and safe for the crew.
[52]
Also, the plaintiff read it right -- after a successful herring and two halibut fisheries, B. McGregor had no special financial need to participate in the salmon fishery, a fishery he freely admits he didn't like. This information was known to the plaintiff and still he opted to go notwithstanding it was bound to be a flawed, late, weak effort. The plaintiff recognized throughout that the choice of when to go and where was the skipper's. He decided to make the best of a poor deal and hope to get more dollars from the later halibut run. There is nothing in the evidence to suggest that an oral agreement with conditions was in place as claimed by the plaintiff, but rather a forlorn hope that after successful fisheries ventures and much-needed repair work, he could really expect a successful salmon effort from a skipper who didn't like salmon fishing.
[53]
The salmon fishery in 1987 could be described as a financial disaster for all concerned. The plaintiff hoped for an early start because they had missed out on such a start in 1986. Being quick off the mark, as it were, meant more fish available because "the other guys" had not been there fishing or at least not in large numbers. The plaintiff could not seriously have expected the salmon fishery would be properly and seriously pursued. However, I do believe he had the right to expect, if not demand, that every effort would be bent to make the 1987 salmon fishery as successful as possible. The plaintiff, however, should have known the salmon fishery would not be pursued with serious effort, given the personality of B. McGregor, his hatred of salmon fishing, the money already earned in herring and halibut, his marriage problems and his drinking problem. It was financially a loss for the plaintiff but one he should have foreseen.
[54]
Any preparatory work done by the plaintiff would not add to the damages he was entitled to from the defendant. The size of the catch and its worth determined the wages earned by the plaintiff, with nothing extra for the cleanup and preparation. The plaintiff himself stated in evidence he knew other people did make such arrangements and had done so himself "but not with Barry McGregor - no". (p. 91 of transcript). This portion of the plaintiff's claim is dismissed.
Counterclaim
[55]
This has a peculiar history in that the defendant's counsel wrote to the plaintiff's counsel on October 25, 1991, to this effect:
"We have instructions to advise that the counterclaim
will be dropped
. The documents required for question 605 will no longer be required." (Emphasis added)
Any objective reading of that claim leaves no room for doubt that the counterclaim was dropped.
[56]
Then, after telephone conversations between the two counsel, the counsel for the defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) wrote and argued that he "inadvertently said the counterclaim would be dropped and failed to refer to the fact that, in my mind, I was referring to Part A of the defendant's counterclaim which says general damages for lost profits under the 1989 herring fishery and that we intended to maintain our counterclaim for general damages consequent upon the plaintiff's failure to assist in bring [sic] the 'Manitou III' back to home port." In any event I permitted the defendant to proceed on the understanding that costs would be awarded to the plaintiff whatever the outcome of the counterclaim.
[57]
Counsel for the plaintiff conceded in argument "for obvious reasons" the following: (Transcript, p. 514)
"I'm prepared to concede that when Mr. McGregor hires Mr. Lundberg, Mr. Lundberg agrees that he will stay with the vessel and assist the vessel and have the vessel return to Vancouver."
Cheek-by-jowl with this, however, counsel for the plaintiff argues:
"But also there's an obligation on the skipper, again, in my submission, to ensure that the vessel prosecutes the fishery."
Although I was not prepared to speculate on the alleged terms of the contract "to prosecute with a serious effort", it is equally clear, and both sides make the point, that when hired it is for the whole of the fishery including preparation of the vessel, fishing and staying with the vessel until it is cleaned, cleared and possibly painted and/or scraped. Not to meet that commitment is a clear breach by the commercial fishermen unless there are extenuating circumstances that might justify leaving the vessel early. Such is the situation here. McGregor made an effort to provide a qualified skipper who was properly insured but that effort fell short when the new skipper walked away from the job after a fight on board the Vessel. At this point McGregor had an obligation to return to the Vessel himself and conduct its passage home or once again to retain a qualified skipper. His failure to do so in my view justified the plaintiff leaving early. McGregor's erratic conduct and behaviour were well known to the plaintiff. Although McGregor said to the crew they were leaving (i.e., 1987 herring fishery) in a few hours, the plaintiff knew that could mean anything from a few hours to a few days. McGregor left for Vancouver just before a herring fishery - only open for a short time - apparently to attend a "discovery" in court. As counsel for the plaintiff put it (p. 515 of transcript), "I would have thought that, given the opportunity to fish a day of herring, Mr. McGregor might have thought of having that [the discovery] adjourned to another date, but in any event he wasn't there." The plaintiff's leaving was the result of a culmination of events that soured the plaintiff on McGregor or as stated, "the final straw ... McGregor was not the man to work for". McGregor did in fact breach the contract, leaving the plaintiff free to go home. He could hardly expect the crew to wait around, uninformed and not knowing if it was drink or the court action that was delaying McGregor's return. Being a skipper carries several responsibilities, which means more money for the skipper than other crew members but he must be there to lead them. If he abandons the task, even for a short period of time, surely the ordinary crew person has the right to do the same. In my view, B. McGregor was the author of his own misfortune and not entitled to damages for the alleged breach of contract by the plaintiff. The counterclaim is dismissed.
Summary
[58]
The plaintiff has successfully argued an oral agreement did exist wherein he was promised a job on the herring fishery in 1987. I have established the sum of $6,000 plus interest from March 31, 1987 as damages. The plaintiff has also been successful in defending the counterclaim, but unsuccessful in alleging a second contract existed which required the skipper B. McGregor to pursue the 1987 salmon fishery quickly and with all resolution possible. In the circumstances I am awarding costs to the plaintiff as he has been the more successful.
Judgment for plaintiff.
