The plaintiff however argues that whether or not there had been any authorization in fact, there was at least ostensible authority for Mr. Keto to make such a commitment and that it was reasonable in the circumstances for Mr. Wiebe to believe that the necessary decisions had been made and that Keto had authority to commit the government. There is some evidence to support that contention. First, a plethora of evidence was presented by the plaintiff concerning the training project at Hayes River in 1977. It was said that work commenced there in August, 1977 before a formal contract was signed between the Government of Canada and the "employer" (in that case the provincial Department of Northern Affairs). The defendant did not deny this although there was no clear evidence as to when the contract was signed or as to whether approval in fact had been given by all the necessary authorities before the work commenced, even if there was no contract signed. Nor, of course, does this evidence in any way prove that the defendant would have been legally bound in 1977 prior to such a contract having been signed. The Hayes River project was also relied on as providing reasonable cause for Mr. Wiebe and perhaps others to believe that Manpower might be funding all of the costs of the Oxford House project including equipment rentals, fuel, repairs, etc. This would add credence to his assumption that Mr. Keto was making a commitment with respect to all costs during the alleged telephone conversation of March 20, 1978. Wiebe admitted that he did not know what departments provided the funding for Hayes River, although the evidence showed that ultimately D.R.E.E. and the Department of Northern Affairs of Manitoba provided a substantial part of it. Much was made by counsel for the plaintiff of a letter of July 4, 1977 from Arran Wilson, then Manager of the C.M.C. office in Thompson to Donald Lowther of the Department of Northern Affairs of the Province of Manitoba concerning the Hayes River project. In this letter Mr. Wilson stated that his department had accepted "in principle" certain costs which were part of the proposal for the Hayes River project. Included in those costs accepted "in principle" were the trainee wages, instructors salaries, equipment rental, fuel and trainees' travelling and living expenses. This letter was taken as evidence that Manpower could pay for all these items. This was never denied by Manpower, but it took the position that it normally would not pay for equipment rental and fuel. There was no evidence that this letter was ever seen by Wiebe prior to his alleged conversation with Jeff Keto on March 20, 1978. It certainly was not addressed to him but was a communication between the Government of Canada and the Government of Manitoba. Furthermore, the letter itself indicates that the Department of Manpower and Immigration would prefer to participate only in the payment of trainee wages and instructional costs and that there would have to be discussions with D.R.E.E. and the Department of Northern Affairs of Manitoba regarding costsharing with them. While the letter as a whole might convey to a casual reader a greater willingness on the part of Canada Manpower to pay such costs as equipment rentals than that Department really felt, there was no evidence that it in fact misled Wiebe into concluding from his telephone conversation with Keto on March 20, 1978 that Manpower was making a commitment to pay all the costs of the project. While it was also implied that this letter could have misled William York, a new Manpower employee at that time, into thinking that Manpower was prepared in a proper case to fund costs such as equipment rentals, that can hardly have misled him as to what expenditures, if any, had been approved the following year in respect of a different project, that at Oxford House.
