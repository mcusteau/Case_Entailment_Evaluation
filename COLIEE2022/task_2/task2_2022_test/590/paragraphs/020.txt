In addition to these facts which indicate that there could not have been a serious intention on the part of either party that in the alleged March 20th telephone conversation Mr. Keto was committing the government to pay whatever Arctic Rentals and the Oxford House Band might agree on by future contracts, there is additional evidence which indicates that Mr. Wiebe understood that Keto would be in no position to make any such commitment as early as March 20th. The evidence indicates that in the period between the delivery of the original training proposal and March 20th, Mr. Wiebe had had conversations with Mr. Wilson; that Mr. Wilson had told him that other departments would have to be consulted and that he as Manager of the Manpower office in Thompson could not authorize Arctic Rentals to proceed with movement of its equipment and make the kind of commitment that would imply. Knowing that, Mr. Wiebe could hardly have assumed that the Acting Manager would in a matter of a week or two have obtained authority to make a legally binding open-ended commitment in the order of $400,000.00 to $500,000.00.
