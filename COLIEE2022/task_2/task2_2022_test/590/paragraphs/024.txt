In argument counsel for the plaintiff contended that if the defendant was not liable in contract it was nevertheless liable, on the basis of quantum meruit, to compensate the plaintiff. His legal brief in support of this proposition consisted of brief references to a few Canadian cases, all of them decisions of the Exchequer Court of Canada and none of them more recent than 1962. For several reasons I do not think this claim can succeed.
