In its claim, as noted above, the plaintiff sought prejudgment interest as well as postjudgment interest. Coming to the conclusion I have that there is no liability this question is of no further concern, although counsel, when questioned on the matter, was unable to show me any authority as to how prejudgment interest could be awarded having regard to the provisions of s. 35 of the Federal Court Act. The evidence did not indicate any agreement between the parties with respect to interest, even in the written contract between the plaintiff and the Band.
