The following facts were either agreed to by the parties or are found by me on the basis of the evidence. In 1978 the plaintiff company carried on the business of renting heavy equipment and the provision of fuel, lubricants, maintenance service and expertise in operation with respect to such equipment. In early 1978 it had three pieces of road building equipment at Hayes River, a location in central Manitoba approximately 135 miles by winter road east of Jenpeg, the nearest location where there was access to an all weather road. The Oxford House Indian Reserve is approximately 50 miles by winter road to the north-east of Hayes River and thus about 185 miles by winter road from Jenpeg.
