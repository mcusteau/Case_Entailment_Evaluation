Mr. Wiebe, the President of Arctic Rentals (a company in which he held all the shares, in trust for James Perfanick of Winnipeg who was the beneficial owner of the shares) was eager to find work for his equipment which had been sitting idle at Hayes River since its involvement the previous summer and autumn in a road building and training project at Hayes River. In early February, 1978 he went to Oxford House to gather more information concerning a gravel stock piling project for which tenders had been called. While there he had some discussion with Dorothy Grieves, then Chief of the Oxford House Band, concerning the possibility of a road building and training project being organized at Oxford House to be carried out during the summer of 1978. The Band wanted to rebuild four miles of road on the reserve, and to construct three-quarters of a mile of new road. It also wanted to use the project for training some of its members in the use of heavy equipment to enable them to get future work on winter road construction. Mr. Wiebe was interested in the possibility of his company being engaged for such a project. He returned to Oxford House about February 20th at which time there were some discussions in the Band office concerning the project. During the course of those discussions a document consisting of one and one-half pages of text and a one page map (Exhibit P-6) was prepared and signed by six members of the Band Council. This document was entitled "Training Program-Oxford House". It briefly described the purpose of the project, recited the previous Hayes River project of 1977 (where eight men from Oxford House received training), described the equipment which would be required and estimated the total cost for equipment rental, fuel, supervisor, instructor, mechanics, camp maintenance, administration, and wages for trainees at a total of $198,000.00. Mr. Wiebe provided council members with some of the cost estimates and other data to assist them in preparing this proposal. This proposal contemplated the training and work would be carried out under the direction of the Band and of Indian Affairs, with "cross-financing" to be negotiated with Canada Manpower and the parties to the "Northlands Agreement" (which involved the federal Department of Regional and Economic Expansion and the Manitoba Department of Northern Affairs). Mr. Wiebe was requested to deliver this proposal to the Canada Manpower Centre in Thompson as he was then returning to Thompson which was his headquarters. Within a day or so he delivered this document at the Canada Manpower Centre in Thompson. He asked to see the manager, Arran Wilson, but he was absent. He left the proposal with Jeff Keto who was Supervisor of Programs and Specialized Services and ranked after Mr. Wilson in seniority in the Thompson office. Mr. Wiebe and Mr. Keto discussed the proposal briefly and Mr. Keto said he would pass it on to Mr. Wilson.
