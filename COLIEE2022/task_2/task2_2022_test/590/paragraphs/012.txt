It is the position of the defendant that no such conversation as that alleged by the plaintiff occurred on March 20, 1978. It contends that, apart from Mr. Keto's denial of any recollection of such a conversation, it would have been highly improbable that Mr. Keto would have given any such assurances since they would have been completely inconsistent with the normal course of business and the state of development of the Oxford House proposal on March 20th. There is much evidence to support this contention. Most of the documentary evidence and facts otherwise established indicate that such a project, costing several hundred thousand dollars, would normally involve three federal government departments and the Government of Manitoba. It is common ground that funding most probably would have been shared among the Department of Manpower and Immigration, the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and the Department of Regional Economic Expansion, the latter possibly cost-sharing jointly with the Province of Manitoba certain aspects of the project under the Northlands Agreement. Further, the evidence showed that, as there was training involved, it would be necessary under the arrangements the federal government had with the provinces (because of provincial jurisdiction over education) that the province help design and approve the training program. Such approval was, in this area, needed from the Keewatin Community College which represented the Province of Manitoba for these purposes. The evidence also disclosed that as far as the Department of Manpower and Immigration was concerned, while it could in theory have funded all or most of a project of this kind pursuant to the Canada Manpower Industrial Training Program (C.M.I.T.P.), it would have preferred not to fund certain aspects such as equipment rentals and would have tried to get funding from D.R.E.E. and the Government of Manitoba under the Northlands Agreement for this aspect. Further, the amounts in question here were far beyond the resources of the Canada Manpower Centre (C.M.C.), the Department's office in Thompson whose whole C.M.I.T.P. budget for 1977-78 was $250,000.00 and for 1978-79 was $270,000.00. It normally provided funds for training in small amounts with numerous small projects. The manager of the Canada Manpower Centre in Thompson could only authorize such projects up to an amount of $10,000.00. Any training project exceeding that amount would have to be reviewed by the Industrial Training Consultant of the Department, who was at that time stationed in Brandon, and be approved by the Regional Director in Winnipeg. The Regional Director could only approve projects up to $100,000.00, and any expenditures over that amount for C.M.I.T.P. had to be approved by an Assistant Deputy Minister or the Deputy Minister of the Department in Ottawa.
