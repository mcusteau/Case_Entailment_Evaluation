On March 22, 1984, almost six years after these events, Arctic Rentals commenced action in the Manitoba Court of Queen's Bench against the Band for breach of the contract of March 28, 1978. The following day Arctic Rentals commenced the present action in this court against Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, alleging breach of an oral agreement under which the defendant's representatives allegedly agreed orally that in consideration of the plaintiff performing its obligations under the two contracts made with the Oxford House Band, the defendant government would
"pay to the Plaintiff all costs of the equipment rental, the training program, and the fuel and other materials supplied to the Band and its council."
It is common ground that the action against the Band in the Court of Queen's Bench has never proceeded beyond the filing of a statement of defence.
