To what extent can all this misinformation from government employees have caused Mr. Wiebe to form a reasonable belief that a firm commitment had been made by Manpower with respect to finding all the costs? It must first be noted that he was neither present at the March 20th meeting on the reserve where Mr. York made erroneous statements nor was the erroneous letter of April 11, 1978 addressed to him. (Indeed, anything which happened after March 20th cannot, as such, have entered into any understanding which he says he had on that day that a contract had been made with Mr. Keto by telephone. Nor does the April 11th letter, when read in conjunction with all the other material, show that in fact Manpower had made such a commitment. The other evidence cited above shows that Manpower was only in the early stages of considering the proposal as of March 20th and Mr. Boultbee, who was not speaking for Manpower, had been misled into believing otherwise). Mr. Wiebe was, however, the recipient of secondhand misinformation by virtue of the telephone conversation he had with Mr. Alpheus Hart, a member of the Band, who had been at the meeting earlier that day and had heard Mr. York's misstatements. The meeting had been conducted mostly in Cree, whereas Hart gave an account of it in English to Wiebe. Hart admitted on cross-examination that he was personally anxious to see this project proceed, because it potentially could provide work for him. He was not a member of the Band Council and did not share any responsibilities for any commitments the Band might be obliged to make. All in all I think it is fair to assume that he exaggerated the degree of commitment which had been conveyed to the Band by Mr. York. I do not believe it was reasonable for Mr. Wiebe to rely on this secondhand information as to statements made by a very junior officer of the Department of Manpower that government funds in the order of several hundred thousand dollars had been legally committed to this project. Even he, and Mr. Perfanick who was nearby, thought it prudent to phone the C.M.C. office in Thompson for confirmation. I am not satisfied that the misinformation inspired by Mr. York can be viewed as a significant cause for Mr. Wiebe to have formed a reasonable belief with or without his conversation with Mr. Keto (if it indeed took place) that a firm decision had been taken by the government to fund the project. I have therefore concluded that as of March 20, 1978 apart from any alleged conversation with Mr. Keto, there was no sufficient evidence to lead Mr. Wiebe to a reasonable conclusion that at this early stage in the process there had been final approval by all relevant government agencies for funding of the total amount that would be required.

Was there any intention to contract?
