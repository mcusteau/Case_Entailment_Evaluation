On April 26, 1978 there was a meeting in Thompson involving representatives of the Oxford House Band, of Keewatin Community College (representing the provincial interest in training projects), and of three federal departments: Indian and Northern Affairs, Regional Economic Expansion, and Manpower and Immigration. It is apparent that problems were identified at that time with respect to the project and its funding. The contract already signed by the Band and Arctic Rentals was not revealed at that meeting. Eventually, on June 8th at a public meeting on the Oxford House reserve, government representatives advised the Band and Mr. Wiebe that the project as conceived by them would not be approved for funding. Arctic Rentals equipment could not, of course, be demobilized or removed from Oxford House by that time because the winter roads were no longer usable. As a result it was not demobilized until February, 1979, as noted above. Apart from some minor preliminary work performed by this equipment (as covered in invoice number 77 of April 19 and April 20, 1978) this equipment apparently remained idle until its removal from the reserve. The plaintiff proceeded to bill the Oxford House Band for mobilization charges and equipment rental, as well as fuel (Exhibit D-6) but there was no evidence of any of these amounts ever having been paid by the Band. On August 22, 1978 Chief Jack Grieves and several councillors of the Oxford House Band signed a letter to Arctic Rentals advising the company that the Band could not honour or undertake any construction under the "proposed agreement that was drafted in March 28, 1978". They attributed this to the limited amount of funds they were receiving (presumably, from the Government) for the road construction.
