By its pleading and argument the plaintiff rests its case on the existence of a contract made orally by telephone on March 20, 1978 in a conversation between Jeff Keto of the then Department of Manpower and Immigration and William Wiebe, President of Arctic Rentals. There is very limited circumstantial corroboration of such a conversation having taken place, and none whatsoever as to the alleged contents of the conversation. The evidence being in conflict over both questions, and there being very little reason to prefer the credibility per se of either Mr. Wiebe or Mr. Keto, I must look to the surrounding circumstances to determine which version of events is more probable. It must be remembered that the onus is on the plaintiff to show that there is a balance of probabilities in favour of his version. It must also be noted that the plaintiff waited some six years after the events in question before commencing action (this delay not having been explained to me) and with the passage of nearly four more years before trial the evidence of witnesses as to what happened ten years ago must, as compared to the documentary record, be viewed with some caution.
