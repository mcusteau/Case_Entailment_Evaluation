About March 18th, after discussions between Mr. Wiebe and Mr. Perfanick, it was decided not to wait any longer and Mr. Wiebe started to move his equipment out toward the all-weather road. Mr. Perfanick came with a "low-bed" truck to meet him and they arrived with the equipment at Cross Lake, some ninety-seven miles from Hayes River and between Hayes River and Jenpeg, on the afternoon of March 20, 1978.
