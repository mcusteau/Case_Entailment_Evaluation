Later the same day Mr. Wiebe and Mr. Perfanick nevertheless continued moving their equipment towards Jenpeg, crossing the frozen Nelson River and leaving the equipment on the other side where it could be accessible to the all-weather road. On March 24th Mr. Wiebe went to Oxford House and met with some members of the Band Council. A draft of a contract between the Band and Arctic Rentals was prepared but not signed. Among other things, the Band wanted the contract to give the Band Council overall control of the project. There was also a need for credit with respect to the provision of fuel by Arctic Rentals. Mr. Wiebe flew to Winnipeg where he and Mr. Perfanick revised the contract. Mr. Wiebe returned to Oxford House and met with certain members of the Band Council on March 28th at which time two contracts were signed: by Mr. Wiebe on behalf of Arctic Rentals, and by four members of the Band Council on behalf of the Band. The main contract (P-12) obliged Arctic Rentals to provide certain specified equipment and supervisors and specified the amount payable to it in this respect. It required the Band to pay for a number of costs associated with the project including: fuel; lubricants; repair parts (and apparently, the cost of servicing and installation of repairs); transportation of parts and personnel; board and lodging for Arctic Rentals staff; site survey and lay-out; and "mobilization and demobilization" costs (i.e., moving of the equipment to Oxford House and away from Oxford House). The contract contemplated a work project of twenty-two weeks duration. The associated fuel contract (P-13) provided specifically for Arctic Rentals supplying a specified amount of fuel and oil at the outset, with the Band to pay costs of such goods and the freight within thirty days of delivery.
