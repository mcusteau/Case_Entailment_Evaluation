Apart from the fact that Keto could not have known on March 20th what costs the Band was going to commit itself to in any future contract signed with Arctic Rentals, it is also note-worthy that Arctic Rentals made no effort to show the March 28th contracts to any government representative after their signing and prior to the equipment being moved in, a period of a week or more. During this period Mr. Wiebe had gone back to Thompson and Mr. Perfanick had gone back to Winnipeg. It would have been very easy for them to have shown the contract to officials at either or both of the Manpower office in Thompson and the Manpower regional office in Winnipeg. This would not only have been an act of good faith and of elementary prudence to ensure the commitment of the government to these amounts before the equipment was actually moved, but would also have been consistent with an alleged oral commitment made on March 20th by the government to pay whatever the future contracts made between Arctic Rentals and the Oxford House Band might provide. Failure to show the contracts to government representatives is more consistent either with there being no direct concern with government approval, or with an attempt to confront the government with a fait accompli by moving the equipment onto the reserve and giving the government full details of the total anticipated costs after it was too late to remove the equipment until the following winter. In either case, the plaintiffs conduct after March 20th is not consistent with there having been a contract made in good faith with the government that day.
