None of these particular requirements for liability in quantum meruit were specifically pleaded. For the reasons which I was unable to find that a contract had been entered into I would have difficulty in finding that the equipment was moved at the "request" of the defendant. No evidence was brought forward with respect to acceptance or acquiescence by the defendant apart from the facts alleged to form the basis for a contract. Nor was there any evidence adduced to show the value to the defendant, if any, of the "services" performed by the plaintiff in moving its equipment to the Oxford House reserve. Without some assistance in this respect, I am unable to determine that any benefit was obtained by the defendant or, if so, what the value of that benefit would be. Further, it is certainly arguable that if there was any "benefit" it was conferred in the process of the plaintiff performing a contractual obligation it already had to the Oxford House Band, and this cannot be considered a benefit for the purpose of recovery in quantum meruit [see footnote 7].
