Considering only the decision under appeal, I am unable to agree that it was wrongly made. The jurisprudence is clear that where an applicant's Â compliance with s. 29(b) of the Trade Marks Act is in issue there is a legal burden on the applicant to show compliance, and an evidentiary burden on the opponent to lead evidence in support of the allegations of noncompliance pleaded by him. The evidential burden is the burden of adducing sufficient evidence to persuade the trier of fact that the alleged facts are true: see Sopinka and Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases (Butterworths), pp. 395-401; Cross on Evidence (Butterworths) (6th Ed.), pp. 107-108; Phipson On Evidence (13th Ed.), para. 44-03; McCormick On Evidence (Hornbook Series, West Publishing Co.) (3rd Ed.), pp. 946-948; and Thayer, Preliminary Treatise on Evidence at the Common Law (1898), c. 9. Thus, I am not persuaded that the Registrar's use of the word "prove" in reference to the evidential burden resting on the opponent constituted any specific misdirection in the sense of imparting the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt or something analogous thereto. In my opinion, the meaning to be ascribed to the word in the context in which it was used goes no further than saying that the opponent was left with the risk of failing to make out its case of noncompliance.
