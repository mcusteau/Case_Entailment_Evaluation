The principle enunciated in Tune Masters, supra, has been followed in numerous decisions at the Opposition Board level (see, for example: Congoleum Corp. v. Armstrong (1986), 9 C.I.P.R. 294; Extraversion Inc. v. Xibita Display Systems (1987), 15 C.P.R.(3d) 214; and Calona Wines Ltd. v. Okanagan Vineyards Ltd. (1988), 20 C.P.R.(3d) 573). While the decisions in Tune Masters and the other cases were given after the decision in the present case, and perhaps for that reason were not mentioned by appellant's counsel, they do tend to support his argument that the amount of evidence required to discharge the opponent's evidential burden should be less in cases like the present, where the relevant facts are more readily available to the applicant. I have no problem with that proposition. It is true that the Registrar made no specific reference to the lighter evidential burden resting on the opponent in the present case. I am unable to conclude, however, that this lack of mention is tantamount to misdirection on the part of the Registrar in the context of choosing to ignore completely the diminished evidentiary burden in respect of the s. 29(b) ground of opposition. The final act of weighing all the evidence on the balance of probability in terms of reaching the appropriate result is, in my view, accurately and succinctly stated by the Chairman, Mr. G.W. Partington, in Tubecon Inc. v. Tubeco Inc. (1986), 10 C.P.R.(3d) 386, at pp. 388-389:
"... To the extent that the opponent relies on allegations of fact in its statement of opposition to support a ground based on s. 29(b) and, to the extent that those facts are not self-evident or admitted, there is in accordance with the usual rules of evidence an evidential burden upon the opponent to prove those allegations. The presence of the evidential burden upon the opponent with respect to a particular issue means that in order for the issues to be considered at all, there must be sufficient evidence from which it could reasonably be concluded that the facts alleged to support that issue exist. On the other hand, the presence of the legal burden on the applicant means that if after all the evidence is in, a determinate conclusion cannot be reached, the issue must be decided against the applicant."
In my view, the Registrar simply found that the opponent had not met the evidentiary burden of adducing sufficient admissible evidence to persuade him that the allegations of noncompliance were sustainable.
