The Registrar of Trademarks, in his decision dated January 11, 1985, rejected all of the appellant's grounds of opposition. In its notice of appeal dated March 11, 1985, the appellant contended that the Registrar had erred in his conclusions with respect to each Â of those grounds. At the hearing of the appeal, appellant's counsel chose, however, to limit his attack to the submission that the Registrar had wrongly rejected the ground of opposition based on noncompliance with s. 29(b) of the Act. Thus, the only issue before me is whether the evidence substantiates that submission.
