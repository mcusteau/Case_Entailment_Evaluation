In the result, I am not persuaded that the Registrar committed any reversible error in finding that the appellant had failed to adduce sufficient admissible evidence to discharge the evidentiary onus resting on it. In my opinion, the Registrar acted correctly in rejecting the opposition, and his decision must be upheld. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs to the respondent.
Appeal dismissed.
