Finally, counsel for the appellant submits that the Registrar erred in not drawing an inference from the fact of the respondent's failure to lead evidence in answer to the Stocco and Phenix affidavits. Having found the appellant's evidence to be wanting, it seems to me that the Registrar was entitled to conclude that the respondent's claimed date of first use was no longer in issue. In any event, what is far more significant, in my view, is the appellant's failure to file additional evidence to counteract the Registrar's finding that all of its affidavit evidence was inadmissible, irrelevant or insufficient. The only new evidence on appeal was the affidavit of Frank H. Brown filed by the respondent. In my opinion, that affidavit and the cross-examination thereon only serves to strengthen the respondent's position. In Sim & McBurney v. Majdell Manufacturing Co. and Registrar of Trademarks (1986), 7 F.T.R. 54; 11 C.P.R.(3d) 306 (F.C.T.D.), Strayer, J., was dealing with a situation in which the respondent registered owner of a trademark had been successful before the Registrar. Nonetheless, I consider the learned judge's comments at page 310 are apposite to the present case:
"I have also had regard to the fact that subsequent to this appeal being launched, the respondent has not filed any further evidence to expand upon or clarify the affidavit of Mr. Siwiec even though it was entitled to do so pursuant to s. 56(5) of the Trade Marks Act. According to the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the Plough case, supra, at p. 68, I am entitled to draw such an inference. It must have been apparent to the respondent after the hearing before the registrar that the existing affidavit was at best somewhat vague as a source of facts upon which the court could make the necessary inferences as to use as required by the Act. If the facts are so obvious and straightforward as counsel for Â the respondent suggested then it should have been a simple matter to state those facts in a new affidavit."
In making reference to this case, I am not expressing any definitive opinion regarding the extent to which the appellant might have pursued further available channels of investigation.
