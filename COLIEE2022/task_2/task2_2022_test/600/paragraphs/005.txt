As a preliminary observation, I might note that this is an appeal on what is essentially a question of fact, and the court should be reluctant to reverse the findings of the Registrar unless clearly satisfied that he came to a wrong conclusion on the facts or unless significant new evidence is adduced which would lead to a contrary conclusion: see Kellogg Salada Canada Inc. v.
