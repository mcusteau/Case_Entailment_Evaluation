The main contention of appellant's counsel is that the Registrar misconstrued the onus lying upon an opponent who alleges an applicant's noncompliance with s. 29(b). He submits that such misconception is evidenced by the Registrar's statement that an opponent must "prove" his allegations, and argues that this imposes far too high a burden upon an opponent by requiring him to prove his case conclusively. He advances several ingenious propositions in support of this argument. Appellant's counsel concedes that an opponent pleading noncompliance with s. 29(b) of the Trade Marks Act "probably does have some onus or burden to lead some evidence to support that plea", according to existing authority. Nevertheless, he contends that the evidential burden in this regard should be seen as a light one, where the opposition proceeding is of a type that the evidential facts lie peculiarly within the knowledge of the applicant. It follows, therefore, in his submission that failure by the applicant to lead evidence in response to the opponent's allegations would justify drawing the inference that any evidence which might have been led would have been unfavourable to the applicant. Finally, appellant's counsel argues that the Registrar's alleged misconstruction was the probable result of following a series of decisions at the Opposition Board level which, in his submission, misapplied the judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal in Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Germain (1979), 29 N.R. 361; 43 C.P.R.(2d) 271 (F.C.A.), and were thus wrongly decided. Essentially, the point being made is that the Registrar perceived the evidential burden resting on the opponent as imposing something analogous to the criminal burden of proof.
