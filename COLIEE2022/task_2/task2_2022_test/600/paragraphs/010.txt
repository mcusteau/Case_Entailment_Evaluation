Suffice it to say, I am disinclined to speculate on the likelihood that the Registrar in the present case erroneously adopted faulty reasoning regarding the respective burdens of proof as set out in decisions to which he makes no reference. He did rely on the decision of Joseph Seagram & Sons v. Seagram Real Estate (1984), 3 C.P.R.(3d) 325. The passage from the reasons of the hearing officer to which appellant's counsel takes particular exception reads as follows at p. 329:
"... The presence of an evidential burden on a party with respect to a particular issue means that in order for the issue to be considered at all, there must be sufficient evidence from which it could reasonably be concluded that the facts alleged to support that issue exist."
Counsel neglects to mention the statement immediately following, which reads:
"The presence of the legal burden on a party means that if after all the evidence is in, a determinate conclusion cannot be reached the issue must be decided against that party. (Discussion of these evidentiary principles may be found in c. 2 of Report of the Federal/Provincial Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence (1982), Toronto: Carswell and in c. 16 of Schiff, Evidence in the Litigation Process (2nd Ed. 1983), Toronto, Carswell.)"
