The first Phenix affidavit deals with events well after the material date, and the Registrar acted correctly in rejecting it. Counsel for the appellant submits that the Phenix affidavit is nevertheless relevant in providing some proof of the state of affairs existing prior to the date of opposition, and relies on the presumption of continuance in support of this proposition. However, I am not convinced that the Registrar was obliged to attach undue weight to an affidavit pertaining to efforts on the part of Mr. Phenix to purchase a brewery product labelled Molson's Blue occurring some four years after the filing date of the respondent's application to register. Appellant's counsel further submits that the Phenix affidavit is relevant in suggesting a lengthy period of nonuser of the repondent's trademark and that there is an onus on the applicant to establish that its mark had not been abandoned since the claimed date of first use, citing as authority Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Scott Paper Ltd. (1984), 3 C.P.R.(3d) 469 (Opp. Bd.). While expressing no opinion whether abandonment is a relevant issue where an application is challenged under s. 29(b) of the Act, I must observe in the present case that abandonment was neither argued before the Registrar nor pleaded in the notice of appeal. Consequently, I do not consider it to be an issue before me.
