I should note that the circumstances in which litigation may be appropriately decided on a motion for summary judgment have been considered recently in the Ontario courts. In particular, in
Dawson et al. v. Rexcraft Storage and Warehouse Inc. et al.
(1998), 111 O.A.C. 201; 164 D.L.R.(4th) 257, 271 (C.A.), Borins, J.A., adopted a recent formulation from the United States as the test to be applied under rule 20 of the Ontario
Rules of Civil Procedure
.
"... the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party and the court therefore finds that there are no genuine issues for trial in this case."

Jones v. Clinton and Ferguson
(1998), 990 F.Supp. 657, at p. 679 (U.S. Dist. Ct., Ark.)).
