Although there are significant differences between the paving stones to which the parties' marks relate, they share an important feature, namely their permeability. The design of these interlocking paving stones allows water to drain between them into the ground and, in the case of the defendants' stones, grass to grow in the gaps. As an exterior surface, "permeable concrete" com­bines the rigidity, strength, durability and low maintenance costs of concrete, with an "environmentally friendly" capacity to pro­vide for controlled water run-off between the stones, which reduces the need for the instal­lation of sewer systems and aids water con­servation. These latter characteristics are featured prominently in the literature pro­moting the parties' paving stones.
