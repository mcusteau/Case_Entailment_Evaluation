Accordingly, the respondent has an evidential burden to discharge in showing that there is a genuine issue for trial:
Feoso Oil Ltd. v. Ship Sarla
, [1995] 3 F.C. 68; 184 N.R. 307 at pp. 81-82 (F.C.A.). How­ever, this does not detract from the principle that the moving party has the legal onus of establish­ing the facts necessary to obtain summary judgment:
Ruhl Estate v. Mannesmann Kienzle GmbH et al.
(1997), 137 F.T.R. 81; 80 C.P.R.(3d) 190 at p. 200 (T.D.);
Kirkbi AG et al. v. Ritvik Holdings Inc. et al.
(1998), 150 F.T.R. 205 (T.D.). Thus, both parties are required to "put their best foot forward" so that the motions judge can determine whether there is an issue that should go to trial:
Pizza Pizza Ltd. v. Gillespie
(1990), 33 C.P.R.(3d) 519 at pp. 529-530, 529, 530 (Ont. Gen. Div.).
