First, the defendant has tried to resist the plaintiff's claim on the ground that, contrary to the allegations in the plaintiff's statement of claim, S.F. Concrete has not manufactured or sold paving stones with the SF-ECO mark, and has no intention of doing so. Rather, it proposes only to license others to use the mark SF-ECO in connection with permeable concrete paving stones manufacÂ­tured and sold by licensees. The plaintiff has a motion to amend its pleadings to reflect this fact, and I shall assume for present purposes that the amendment has been made.
