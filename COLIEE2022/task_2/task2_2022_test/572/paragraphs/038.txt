No issue of credibility is involved in determining the distinctiveness of the name "Uni Eco-Stone" and, in my opinion, it does not call for a very "hard look" at the evidence to enable me to conclude that there is no question of fact that can only be fairly resolved by a trial. Again, I remind myself of the plaintiff's obligation to present its strongest case in response to the defendant's motion.
