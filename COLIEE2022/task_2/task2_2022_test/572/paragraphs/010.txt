Rule 216(3) specifically empowers the court to grant a motion for summary judg­ment whether the issues in dispute are legal or factual in nature. However, a motion for summary judgment is not appropriate for deciding questions of fact that turn on credi­bility, or that require the kind of weighing and assessing of conflicting evidence that is properly the province of the trial judge. The applicable principles are usefully set out in
