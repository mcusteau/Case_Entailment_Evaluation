The thrust of the defendant's submission here was twofold. First, while the plaintiff has used the trademark "Uni Eco-Stone" in Canada since 1990, the volume of sales of paving stones bearing this mark is quite small, amounting to a maximum of 300,000 square feet, and probably somewhat less. The defendant only advertised "SF-Eco" paving stones in Canada in 1996 and has no Canadian licensees. There was also evidence before me that "Uni Eco-Stone" is included in brochures and journals aimed at the construction industry, particularly in the United States, but also in Canada, and this indicates that the plaintiff's mark is well known.
