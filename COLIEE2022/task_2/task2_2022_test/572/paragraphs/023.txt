The question of confusion is at the heart of the plaintiff's allegations with respect to both trademark infringement and passing-off. Would the use in Canada of the trademark "SF-Eco" by the defendant or its licensees in connection with permeable concrete paving stones constitute a "confusing trademark" for the purpose of s. 21 of the
Trade-marks Act
, and thus infringe the plaintiff's right to the exclusive use of the trademark "Uni Eco-Stone" in connection with similar goods? And would the defendant's proposed use of its mark "cause or be likely to cause conÂ­fusion in Canada" between its product or business and those of the plaintiff, contrary to s. 7(b) of the
Trade-marks Act
?
