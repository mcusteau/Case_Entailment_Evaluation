It is important at this point to examine the way in which an English court, in dealing with a virtually identical fact situation, has come to a conclusion radically different from that of the Supreme Court of Canada. In The "Halcyon Isle" (supra), the Privy Council dealt with the issue of whether an American necessariesman is entitled to claim the benefit of a maritime lien in a distribution of a fund following a seizure and sale of a ship in Singapore. The Privy Council specifically rejected the Supreme Court of Canada's reasoning in The "Ioannis Daskelelis" and held that both the creation and ranking of claims against the res are to be determined by the lex fori, as if the events giving rise to the right had occurred in the United Kingdom, instead of in the jurisdiction where they actually did happen.
