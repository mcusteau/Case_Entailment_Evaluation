[84]
Apart from the claims themselves, the only evidence profferred as to American law appears in paragraph 4 of the Perrett affidavit which I reproduce in full:
"4. I am advised by David T. McCune, an attorney experienced in maritime law, practicing as a partner in the San Francisco firm of Lillick, McHose and Charles, and verily believe as follows:
'It is my preliminary opinion based upon review of the Agency Agreement dated May 20, 1986 (signed by Brian L. Burry), the list of payments made from funds supplied by the plaintiffs William S. Czech and John Legge to enable the "Galaxias" to cruise from Greece to Vancouver, British Columbia, and the supporting invoices and other documents itemizing the said payments, that,
assuming United States law applies to the Agreement
, the plaintiffs acquired maritime liens against the "Galaxias" to the extent the funds advanced under the Agreement were used to satisfy obligations giving rise to maritime liens, which include specifically advances to pay for crew salaries and wages, fuel, provisions and port expenses.'"
