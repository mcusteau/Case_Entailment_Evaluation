The purchaser became uneasy with respect to the attitude taken by the Greek Minister of Merchant Marine regarding the re-registration of the "Galaxias" in the Greek Registry of Shipping at Piraeus. There was evidence that following the issuance of the Bill of Sale, the Minister objected to the issuance of the necessary Deletion Certificate and made it contingent on the success of N.A.T. in receiving satisfaction for its claims in this court. As a result of this situation, a show cause hearing with respect to a possible contempt of court on the part of N.A.T. having not complied with the court order to register the Deletion Certificate and transfer title of the vessel without encumbrances. It was heard on January 4, 1988, along with argument concerning the balance of the claims. The show cause hearing has been dealt with separately.
