The attack mounted by counsel for Baseline on the jurisdiction of this court to hear N.A.T.'s claim was primarily founded on The "Acrux", [1965] 2 All E.R. 323. The facts in that case were remarkably similar to those in the case before me. In The "Acrux", a corporate body created under the law of Italy for the purposes of providing social benefits to Italian sailors, claimed the benefit of a maritime lien with respect to a large sum of overdue contributions of both seamen and owners. Mr. Justice Hewson of the Admiralty Division of the English High Court was of the opinion that the claimant should be entitled to claim a maritime lien (p. 331), however, he did not feel that he had jurisdiction to entertain the claim. He reasoned that the claim could not be ranked under paragraph 1(1)(o) of the Administration of Justice Act, 1956, which is similar to paragraph 22(1)(o) of the Federal Court Act ("any claim by a master, officer or member of the crew of a ship for wages, money, property or other remuneration or benefits arising out of his employment"). The claim made by N.A.T. does not come within s. 22(1)(o) for the reasons discussed by Mr. Justice Hewson, it is not a claim made "by a master, officer or member of the crew of a ship".
