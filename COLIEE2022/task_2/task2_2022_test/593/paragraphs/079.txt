The assertion that these claims were maritime liens caused me a great deal of concern due to the existence of the decisions referred to above, namely, The "Strandhill" and The "Ioannis Daskelelis" (supra) which would appear to leave no doubt that Canadian courts will acknowledge a validly created maritime lien held by an American provider of necessaries. Needless to say, these claimants would be entitled to a high ranking in the distribution of the proceeds if the material filed by the claimants establishes that they are entitled to a maritime lien.
