The Court of Appeal therefore proceeded to make a determination of the nature of the "hypothèque" under French law. Evidence was given by an expert who stated that under French law, the "hypothèque" created a right in rem which entitled the holder of the "hypothèque" to pursue the ship into the hands of innocent purchasers of the res. Their Lordships were hence of the opinion that the holder of the "hypothèque" enjoyed rights analogous to the maritime lienholder, and that the claimant must be treated as a lienholder in an English court.
