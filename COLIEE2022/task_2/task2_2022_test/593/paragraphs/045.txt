Despite the analysis used by the Supreme Court of Canada, I do not believe that our courts will be inevitably led to the recognition of spurious claims for maritime liens purportedly created by legislative fiat in a foreign jurisdiction. In The "Strandhill" (supra), the limitations to the application of the general principle were discussed. Mr. Justice Newcombe held that a foreign lien would not be enforced in this country when to do so would be either contrary to Canadian public policy or where the contract in question is void for immorality. Mr. Justice Newcombe stated at page 686 of The "Strandhill":
"It cannot of course be said that the contract is void on the ground of immorality, nor is it contrary to such positive law as would prohibit the making of it, and therefore I think that the right which has accrued under or incident to it, may be recognized and enforced, if the tribunal to which the plaintiff has resorted has the requisite jurisdiction."
