Naftikon Apomachikon Tameion is a public body created by statute in the Republic of Greece. Although it operates with some degree of autonomy it ultimately falls under the supervision and control of the Greek Minister of Merchant Marine. N.A.T. is charged with the collection and administration of monies received from the owners of Greek registered ships. These funds are made up from a percentage deducted by the owners from the wages of the ship's crew as well as a proportionate contribution from the owners.
