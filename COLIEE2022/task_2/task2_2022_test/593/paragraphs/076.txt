As a further note of interest I would add that if counsel is advancing the proposition that the docking of the ship as a "floating hotel" with connections to the dock was sufficient to alter the nature of the employment of the band members, this could also presumably apply not only to the rest of the crew but also to any subsequent lien claimants, including the wharfinger, Baseline Industries Ltd. This is clearly not the case, and I find therefore that the musicians are entitled to a maritime lien with respect to wages earned during the full term of their employment including repatriation expenses and interest.
