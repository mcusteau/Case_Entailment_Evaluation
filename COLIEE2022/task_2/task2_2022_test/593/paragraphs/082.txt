Rule 1008 of the Federal Court Rules provides that the court has broad discretion to regulate the procedure relating to the distribution of proceeds of property arrested under a warrant. Section 1008(2) states:
"(2) For the purpose of any application under paragraph (1), the court may, at the time it makes the order for sale of the property or at any time thereafter, give directions as to notices to be given to other possible claimants to such money, and as to advertising for such other claimants, as to the time within which claimants must file their claims, and generally as to the procedure to be followed to enable the Court properly to adjudicate upon the right of the parties, and to give judgment upon any claim or claims against the money in court;
and any claim that is not made within the time limited, and in the manner prescribed, by such an order of the court shall be barred, and the court may proceed to determine the other claims and distribute the moneys among the parties entitled thereto without reference to any claim so barred
