A review of the documents filed by the American claimants reveals:
(i) an affidavit from a Canadian solicitor (now without instructions and no longer solicitor of record) which introduces a quantity of unexplained photocopied documents (the Sachs affidavit),
(ii) two affidavits filed by another solicitor (from the same firm) stating that each of the claimants Czech and Legge are entitled to maritime liens against the ship "Galaxias" in the amounts of $58,000.00 and $290,432.00 (U.S.) respectively for supplying monies which were used to pay crew's wages and purchase fuel and provisions (the Cunningham affidavits),
(iii) an affidavit from the claimant Czech personally, reiterating the statements in the Cunningham affidavit referring to his claim,
(iv) the affidavit of another solicitor from the firm above, introducing some comments with respect to American maritime liens and, as an Exhibit, a document entitled "Agency Agreement and Guarantee" apparently made between the claimants and a Mr. Brian L. Burry, agent for the charterer of the ship (the Perrett affidavit),
(v) the affidavit of Brian Burry indicating that he received monies from the claimants and either purchased necessaries himself for the ship or gave them to a Mr. Berry Jones who used the funds to purchase necessaries, and
(vi) the letter written by Mr. Czech to the court indicating that he claims a maritime lien with respect to the monies paid and that Mr. Czech is willing to provide any further material that the court may need.
