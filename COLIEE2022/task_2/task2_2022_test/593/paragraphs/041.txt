Moreover, the decision of the Privy Council in The "Halcyon Isle" was by no means unanimous. Two of the five members dissented. During the course of their review of the two competing theories of recognition of foreign maritime liens, the dissenting Lords, Salmon and Scarman, recognized that the route chosen by Canada could be seen as an encouragement to the mounting of spurious claims through the legislative process of other nations, although they ultimately approve of the Canadian approach. As their Lordships stated in their joint dissenting judgment at page 244:
"Whether it be put in terms of the law of the sea or of the rules of private international law, the question has to be asked and answered in this appeal: does English and Singapore law recognize a foreign maritime lien, where none would exist, had the claim arisen in England or Singapore? Whatever the answer, the result is unsatisfactory. If in the affirmative, maritime states may be tempted to pass 'chauvinistic' laws conferring liens on a plurality of claims so that the claimants may obtain abroad a preference denied to domestic claimants; if in the negative, claimants who have given the ship credit in reliance upon their lien may find themselves sorely deceived. If the law of the sea were a truly universal code, those dangers would disappear. Unfortunately the maritime nations, although they have tried, have failed to secure uniformity in their rules regarding maritime liens: see the fate of the two Conventions of 1926 and 1967 (British Shipping Laws (2nd Ed.), vol. 8 (1973), pp. 1392, 1397), each entitled (optimistically) an International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Maritime Liens and Mortgages. Though it signed each of them, the United Kingdom has not ratified either of them. In such confusion policy is an uncertain guide to the law. Principle offers a better prospect for the future."
