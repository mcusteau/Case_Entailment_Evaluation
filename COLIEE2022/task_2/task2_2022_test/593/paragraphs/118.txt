[118]
The court acknowledges the valuable assistance of the solicitor for the seamen who has been entirely successful in advancing the claims of his clients before this court. His clients throughout were in a most preferred position but payment was unnecessarily delayed for months because of the actions of N.A.T. or the Minister of Merchant Marine of Greece. I am therefore prepared to entertain a motion for costs over and above the regular tariff to fix an appropriate amount in this regard and any additional costs which I may award in excess of the tariff will be payable by N.A.T.
