Even if I were prepared to accept the statement of Mr. Perrett that he verily believes Mr. McCune's assessment of the claimants' position, the opinion of an expert is not admissible in this court when the expert is not available for cross-examination (rule 482 of the Federal Court Rules (supra)). In any event, there is a problem arising from a close examination of the quotation which is fatal to the claimants' assertion. Mr. McCune states that the payments made by Czech and Legge would be the subject of a maritime lien
assuming United States law applies to the agreement
. Mr. McCune makes no comment on whether it does or not. In my opinion, it clearly does not.
