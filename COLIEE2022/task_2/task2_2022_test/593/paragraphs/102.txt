I do however feel that it is not appropriate to rank the seamen's wages pari passu with the claims of N.A.T. and the liens of the American necessariesmen, had they been proven. Even though this court recognizes that the enactment of foreign statute can create a maritime lien, I do not believe that the ranking of this type of claim has yet been specifically considered in Canadian jurisprudence particularly as it applies to seamen's wages. Historically, these maritime liens have been given unquestioned priority and I intend to do so as well.
