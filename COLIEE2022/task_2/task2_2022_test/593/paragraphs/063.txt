Mr. Justice Hewson then went on to consider an excerpt from Dicey's Conflict of Laws (7th Ed.), which states that any action in rem which is brought in an English court must relate to a question or claim specified to be within the admiralty jurisdiction as determined by the domestic law. He stated at page 331, with reference to Lord Justice Scott's decision in The "Tolten", United Africa Co. Ltd. v. "Tolten" (Owners), [1946] 2 All E.R. 372:
"In my view, this particular maritime lien for unpaid insurance contributions is not one which is recognized by this Court. In view of L.J. Scott's approval of the Dicey pronouncement, I am unable to stretch this Court's equitable jurisdiction to include it; that is a matter for the legislature or, it may be, some higher Court.
No case has been quoted to show, much as I desire to do it, that I may enlarge the jurisdiction to benefit the foreign claimants when English claimants have no similar benefits conferred on them
