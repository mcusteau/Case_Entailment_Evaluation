In addition, the Deputy Marshall commenced court action no. T-2297-87 against the purchaser Global, and all the claimants from the proceeds of the sale and sought a Declaration from this court that he has fulfilled his duties with respect to the Order of Sale, and for direction from the court with respect to the disbursement of the proceeds. The Deputy Marshall is also of course a claimant from the fund with respect to the cost of the sale and other charges occasioned by the carrying out of the Order of Sale. Global filed a defence in court action no. T-2297-87 and also counterclaimed with respect to all the costs and damages which it alleges have occurred due to the failure of the Deputy Marshall to convey the ship to it "free and clear of all encumbrances", sufficient to allow the ship to be registered in the Greek Registry. N.A.T. was made a third party to the action.
