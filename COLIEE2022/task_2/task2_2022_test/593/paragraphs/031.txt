One of the most important early cases dealing with the recognition of maritime rights arising from a foreign jurisdiction is The "Colorado", [1923] P. 102 (C.A.). This case dealt with a French flagged ship which was subject to a "hypothèque" validly constituted under French civil law. The ship was seized and sold in the United Kingdom at the behest of some Welsh necessariesmen who had performed repairs on The "Colorado" when it was docked at Cardiff. The holder of the "hypothèque" appeared before the court a full year after the ship had been sold and claimed an interest in the proceeds.
