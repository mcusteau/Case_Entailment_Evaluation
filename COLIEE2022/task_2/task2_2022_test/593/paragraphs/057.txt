As early as The "Strandhill", supra, the Supreme Court recognized that the jurisdiction to give effect to American statutory liens was not founded on the existence of a comparable provision in Canadian legislation. The proper issue to consider was whether the Federal Court (then the Exchequer Court) would have had jurisdiction, had such a comparable enactment been made by a Canadian legislative Act. The court in The "Strandhill" had no doubt on the facts before it that this was so; nor do I believe that it is beyond doubt that if the federal government were to create a body analogous to N.A.T. and secure monies owing to it by means of maritime liens, that this court would have the jurisdiction to hear and adjudicate claims with respect to liens created in this manner.
