Despite its initial appeal, I cannot agree with the contention that this restriction can be imported into Canadian law. The Supreme Court has clearly stated on several occasions that the substantive rights of the parties are to be determined by reference to the lex loci. The treatment which Canada as the forum would accord such a claim in its domestic law does not enter into consideration. As Mr. Justice Ritchie stated in quoting from the decision at first instance in The "Strandhill" at page 1252 of The "Ioannis Daskelelis":
"In rendering the judgment at first instance in the Nova Scotia Admiralty District, Mellish, L.J.A., said:
'If a maritime lien exists, it cannot be shaken off by changing the location of the res. A foreign judgment in rem creates a maritime lien and even although such judgment could not have been obtained in the courts of this country, it will be enforced here by an action in rem. But a maritime lien may be created by foreign law otherwise than by a judgment in rem; and if it be so created I think that it can be equally enforced here in the same way. If the plaintiffs have lawfully acquired the right to the res even under foreign law, it would be strange if they had not the liberty to enforce it here in the only court providing relief in rem.'"
