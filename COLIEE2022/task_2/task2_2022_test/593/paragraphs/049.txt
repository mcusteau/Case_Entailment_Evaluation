Canadian maritime law exists in part to acknowledge claims in rem made by any party who provides services to a ship. The purpose of this rule is evidently that those who maintain a ship and keep her productive create a benefit to all those who have an interest in her. Maritime law has determined that the other creditors of the ship must acknowledge the importance of services rendered to her, and that most other claims are subordinated to those of seamen and repairers in possession.
