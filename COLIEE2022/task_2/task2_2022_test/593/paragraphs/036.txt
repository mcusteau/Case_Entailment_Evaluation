It is at this point that counsel for Baseline is attempting to import a limitation into what would appear to be a general rule with respect to the recognition of foreign maritime liens in Canada. Counsel has argued that as the claims of necessariesmen in Canada are recognized as being claims in rem, the fact that an American statute enhances the status of these claims into a full blown maritime lien is merely a case of polishing up an apple into a bigger and brighter apple. He extended his analogy to the case before me and stated that the Greek legislation creating a maritime lien in favour of N.A.T. was an attempt to make an orange into an apple, and that this situation could never have been contemplated by the Supreme Court; that it was an extension of the principle beyond all logical limits.
