I am satisfied that the terms "seaman" and "member of the crew" in the Canada Shipping Act (supra) and the Federal Court Act (supra) respectively, should be given a very broad interpretation (Adrien Balodis et al. v. Ship "Prince George" et al. and Continental Bank of Canada, [1985] 1 F.C. 890. It has also long been recognized that the cruise ship has particular needs with respect to crew, based on the nature of the enterprise (e.g. Connor v. Ship "Flora" (1898), 6 Ex. C.R. 131).
