The evidence of Mr. Bournis is that the monies owing to N.A.T., wage deductions and owners contributions, are bestowed the same "privilege" in Greek maritime law as seamen's wages. This is confirmed by the translation provided to the court of article 205 of the Code of Maritime Law, Act. No. 381611958 of the Republic of Greece:
"Article 205 - The following privileged claims have priority on the ship and cargo in the following order:
(a) The legal costs incurred in the common interest of all creditors, dues and charges on the ship, taxes in connection with the navigation, watchman and maintenance costs incurred since the ship's arrival at the last port.
(b)
The claims of the master and crew members arising out of an employment contract: also the claims of the seamen's pension fund (Naftikon Apomachikon Tameion)
.
(c) The expenses arising out of salvage.
(d) The amounts owing to the ship, passengers or cargoes due to collision.
"The above privileges take priority over the mortgage." (emphasis added)
