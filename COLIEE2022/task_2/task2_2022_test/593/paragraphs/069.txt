Finally, it was argued before me that the monies expended by N.A.T. in paying the crew's salary after seizure and in repatriating the seamen were paid on a voluntary basis. Although these claims would have been the subject of a maritime lien in the hands of the crewmen involved, counsel argues that a lien cannot be transferred and it was hence extinguished when N.A.T. stepped forward and supplied the money itself. There is no merit in that argument. Evidence was submitted to the effect that providing repatriation expenses and payment of salaries under the extraordinary situation in which the "Galaxias" crew found themselves was required by Greek law. The words of s. 205(b) of the Code of Maritime Law (supra) "the claims of the seamen's pension fund", do not exclude monies paid to stranded sailors. The entire amount of N.A.T.'s claim is protected by a maritime lien and will be dealt with accordingly.
