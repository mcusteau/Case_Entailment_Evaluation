In my opinion a band of musicians engaged by contract for the entertainment of passengers at sea on a cruise ship are as integral a part of the crew as are the galley staff, stewards and cabin boys. It remains to be determined therefore whether the fact that the "Galaxias" subsequently docked at Vancouver and set up connections with the shore for the purpose of establishing a "floating hotel" would have the effect of changing the nature of the musicians' employment so that the wages attributable to the latter part of their services would not be accorded the protection of a maritime lien.
