I should also comment that the sum total of evidence profferred by the claimants falls far short of establishing the validity of any of these claims. The Perrett affidavit, while evidently filed in support of motion to amend the statement of claim would not have been sufficient to establish that the arrangement between the claimants and Mr. Burry for Hellenic Cruises would give rise to the benefits of a maritime lien under American law.
