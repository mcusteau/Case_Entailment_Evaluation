The choice of law of the contract falls to be determined according to the laws of Canada, the lex fori. In the absence of an express or implied provision relating to a choice of laws, it must be determined by the law with which the transaction has the closest and most real connection (Castel, J.-G., Canadian Conflicts of Law (2nd Ed.), p. 530). In the absence of any convincing proof to the contrary, I hold this to be the law of the flag of the "Galaxias", namely Greek law.
