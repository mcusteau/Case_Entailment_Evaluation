Rouleau, J.
: This action involves the distribution of proceeds following the arrest and judicial sale of a Greek registered vessel, the ship "Galaxias", in the Port of Vancouver. As is frequently encountered, the claims against the "Galaxias" far exceed the proceeds of the sale so the ranking of the respective claims will in some cases determine whether they are to be satisfied at all [see footnote 1]. One of the most difficult and novel claims to be analysed and ranked by this court is the one asserted by the Naftikon Apomachikon Tameion "N.A.T.", a public corporate institution created by Greek law and somewhat akin to a Canadian Crown corporation. It administers pensions and other social benefits on behalf of Greek seamen.
