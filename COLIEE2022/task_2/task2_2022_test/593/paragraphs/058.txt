There is however a much simpler way of viewing the whole issue of jurisdiction. If Canadian law requires that we decide whether or not a claim amounts to a maritime lien according to the lex loci of the claim, I fail to see how the Federal Court could lack jurisdiction over what Canadian conflicts of law has dictated must amount to a maritime lien in this country. I believe that this is the approach taken in The "Har Rai". Sections 22(2)(m) and 43(3) of the Federal Court Act would appear to limit the right in rem of necessariesmen to the case where the beneficial owner of the ship at the time when the action is brought is the same as at the time when the obligation was incurred. When however an American necessariesman claimed a maritime lien with respect to an obligation which arose where there was not an identity of beneficial owners as required by s. 43(3), the court held that it had jurisdiction to receive and give effect to the claim. As Mr. Justice Le Dain stated at page 745 of The "Har Rai":
"In my view, the jurisdiction to enforce a maritime lien for necessaries must be considered to be in addition to the jurisdiction conferred by para. 22(2)(m) of the Act with respect to a claim for necessaries that is unsecured by maritime lien. Otherwise, the limitation imposed by s. 43(3) of the Act on the in rem jurisdiction of the court with respect to a claim mentioned in para. 22(2)(m) - that it shall not be exercised unless at the time of the commencement of the action the ship is beneficially owned by the person who was the beneficial owner at the time when the cause of action arose - would deprive the lien of one of its principal effects."
