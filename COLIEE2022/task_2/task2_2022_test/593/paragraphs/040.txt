With all due respect to their Lordships, I will follow Mr. Justice Ritchie as I believe that the decision in The "Halcyon Isle" is a clear departure from that in The "Colorado" and is based on a misconception of the significance of the case. Any attempt to review the claim asserted by N.A.T. in terms of Canadian law would be a clear departure from the reasoning of the Supreme Court and to follow the Privy Council, would, in my respectful opinion, not be a reflection of Canadian maritime law today.
