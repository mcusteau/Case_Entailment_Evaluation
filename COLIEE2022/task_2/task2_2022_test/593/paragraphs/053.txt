The jurisdiction of the Federal Court with respect to maritime law has been exhaustively analysed by the Supreme Court of Canada on several occasions in the last decade. I have reviewed these authorities and it is my understanding that the Federal Court has jurisdiction in maritime matters if the following three conditions are met:
"1. There must be a statutory grant of jurisdiction by the federal Parliament.
"2. There must be an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction.
"3. The law on which the case is based must be 'a law of Canada' as the phrase is used in s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867."
