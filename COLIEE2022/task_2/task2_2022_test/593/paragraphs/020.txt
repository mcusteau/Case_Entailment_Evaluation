The rights afforded to the holder of these "privileged claims" or liens as I shall call them, correspond to the rights enjoyed by the lienholder in Canadian maritime law - the right to pursue the res into the hands of the innocent purchaser at a public auction and the right to priority in ranking over the mortgage holder. I therefore find that the Greek Parliament has created by operation of statute a maritime lien which is in substance analogous to a maritime lien in Canadian law.
