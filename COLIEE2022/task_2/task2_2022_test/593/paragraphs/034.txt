The Court of Appeal went on to apply English law with respect to the ranking of the respective claims. As the holder of a maritime lien or its equivalent, the holder of the "hypothèque" ranked ahead of the necessariesmen, who were not able to claim the benefit of a possessory lien. It is extremely important to note that in France, the claim of the holder of a "hypothèque" would be subordinated to the claim of necessariesmen in the determination of priorities, but as the right accorded to the claimant was separate from the remedy sought, this did not effect the outcome of the case when heard in an English court.
