The English Court of Appeal, in upholding the decision of the trial judge, held that in maritime matters, the nature of the right asserted is properly analysed under the law of the contract where it arose, whereas the remedy which this right is to be given is determined according to the law of the forum where the claimant seeks relief. Lord Justice Atkin stated at page 110 of the decision:
"Where parties are litigating in this country in respect of rights created elsewhere, to ascertain their rights we may look, in appropriate cases, to the law of the country where the contract was made, or where the thing over which the rights are claimed was situate, or where the person claiming the right is domiciled: but to ascertain the remedies which the court will give to enforce the rights we have to look to the law of this country, the lex fori."
