The possessory lienholder Baseline will probably collect the small amount of its lien regardless of whether N.A.T. is successful or not. I further note on viewing the reference before Mr. Charles Stinson with regard to the payment of the Marshall's costs for the maintenance and sale of the "Galaxias", in excess of $150,000.00 that Baseline is not walking away from this affair empty handed and I do not feel there is any reason to invoke equitable principles so as to upset the rules of ranking on this ground.
