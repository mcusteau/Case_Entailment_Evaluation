In The "Strandhill" (supra), Newcombe, J., stated at pages 684-685 of his judgment:
"In the Ripon City (3), Gennell Barnes, J., in the course of an instructive judgment, adopts Lord Tenterden's definition, and he says:
'The definition of a maritime lien as recognized by the law maritime given by Lord Tenterden has thus been adopted. It is a privileged claim upon a thing in respect of service done to it or injury caused by it, to be carried into effect by legal process.'
