Counsel for the crew has also provided a British textual reference namely British Shipping Laws (1980), D.R. Thomas, vol. 14, at page 281, on the same topic:
"The Court of Admiralty, in harmony with the courts of law and equity, has long recognized the dangers of 'stale claims' and they have insisted that claims be advanced with reasonable expedition. A lienee who sleeps on his claim may well discover the judicial forum to be unsympathetic and unwilling to offer a remedy, particularly if the delay has been coupled with a want of due diligence or proved prejudicial to the parties. Given the nature of a maritime lien it is patently transparent that inactivity on the part of the lienee is capable of working substantial harm on the innocent and unsuspecting. This danger was recognized as early as The 'Bold Buccleugh' where the Privy Council combine the cautious restraint of the doctrine of laches with their exposition of the newly coined maritime lien. Sir John Jervis observed:
'It is not necessary to say that the lien is indelible, and may not be lost by negligence or delay, where the rights of third parties may be compromised; but where reasonable diligence is used, and the proceedings are had in good faith, the lien may be enforced into whosoever's possession the thing may come.'"
