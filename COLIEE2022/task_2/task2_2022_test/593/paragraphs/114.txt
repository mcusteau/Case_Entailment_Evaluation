[114]
With respect to the interest claimed by N.A.T. on the monies owing to it in the action T-2406-86, I am satisfied that the provisions for interest in the relevant Greek statute are more than generous and on one interpretation could amount to an almost usurious rate. I seriously considered therefore the possibility of not allowing the claims for interest relating to the period when the "Galaxias" was outside Greek waters.
