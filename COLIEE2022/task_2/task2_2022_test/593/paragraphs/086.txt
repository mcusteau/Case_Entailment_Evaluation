The agency agreement and guarantee was not signed by the claimants, only by Brian L. Burry. Its purpose is to provide for the transfer of funds from the claimants to the then owner of the "Galaxias", Hellenic Cruise Lines. The latter company is Greek. The "Galaxias" was a Greek flagged ship and the monies forwarded during the voyage were disbursed in Greece, the Canary Islands, Aruba, Panama, Mexico, the United States and Canada. The claimants were American, and the payments were made in United States dollars. No indication as to the place where the contract was signed is in evidence. The claimants' investment is guaranteed by a Canadian company, then a prospective purchaser of the "Galaxias".
