Eric Cochegrus-Montes in his affidavit dated April 13, 1987 filed in support of the claim of all the members of "Passport of Acapulco" states that the band was taken aboard the cruise ship "Galaxy" (sic) on June 17th, 1986 and performed until September 28, 1986 when their employment was terminated. He introduces as an exhibit to his affidavit the agreement between the owners' agents and the band and it seems clear that the band was engaged to live and perform on the ship for the time stipulated, with no distinction made between the time at sea and the time when the "Galaxias" was to be docked in Vancouver Harbour. I also note that Elias Metaxas, purser of the "Galaxias", included the individual members of the band on a crew list under the heading Additional Crew List, and counted them in a "grand total of crew members" on this list (Exhibit C to the affidavit of Eric Cochegrus-Montes).
