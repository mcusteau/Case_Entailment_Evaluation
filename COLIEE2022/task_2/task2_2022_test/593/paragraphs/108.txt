Apart from the issue of contempt however, I am mindful that virtually all of the costs of the allied action T-2297-87, brought by the Deputy Marshall against the purchaser Global Cruises S.A. were occasioned by the failure of the appropriate organ of the Greek government to produce the Certificate in question. All of the costs incurred by Global in mounting the counterclaim and defending the action were also in my opinion reasonable and understandable, and were as a direct result of N.A.T.'s failure to indicate right from the earliest moment possible that the issuance of the Certificate was outside its power, and even likely to be refused by the Minister.
