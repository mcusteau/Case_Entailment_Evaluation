After the seizure however, the right to interest is a remedy which is determined according to the lex fori, and for the reasons given above, I believe that N.A.T. has disentitled itself from the consideration of the court to such an award. This limitation does not apply to the sums expended by N.A.T. to repatriate the crew and to pay them salary advances, nor does it apply to monies owed to N.A.T. by the crew. These amounts will be subject to the rate of 6% interest per annum.
