As I understand it, my powers in equity to upset the orders of priority long established in Canadian maritime law should be exercised only where necessary to prevent an obvious injustice. It is not immediately obvious to me that this is likely to occur if I do not intervene. With respect to the claims of N.A.T. as they affect the claims of the National Bank of Greece S.A., as stated previously, the Bank of Greece must be well aware of the statutory authority of N.A.T. and cannot plead surprise with respect to N.A.T.'s claim. Furthermore, it ill behooves the Bank to raise the question of laches on N.A.T.'s behalf for it too allowed the "Galaxias" to sail from Greek waters while subject to a mortgage, which as far as I can determine, was for an amount several times the appraised value of the ship.
