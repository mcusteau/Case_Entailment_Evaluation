As an example, ss. 284(1) and (2) of the Canada Shipping Act, supra, provide a mechanism whereby a public authority may recover monies disbursed for seamen's medical needs "in the court and in the manner in which wages may be recovered by seamen". This, in my understanding creates a maritime lien in favor of the appropriate public authority. I note that the Supreme Court of Prince Edward Island has held (Household Finance Corporation of Canada v. Hill (1970), 1 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 66; 13 D.L.R.(3d) 737), that monies withheld from seamen's wages as pension benefits constitute "emoluments" under an earlier version of the Canada Shipping Act, namely R.S.C. 1952, c. 29, and are hence not subject to garnishment proceedings under provincial law.
