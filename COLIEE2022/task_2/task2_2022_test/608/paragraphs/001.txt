Mosley, J.
: This is a request on behalf of Mr. Kirpal Singh Mann for an Order prohibiting the respondent from removing the applicant from Canada on December 21, 2004 and an Order extending the time for the service and filing of the motion. I have considered the materials submitted and heard counsel for the parties. The test to be applied on an application for a stay of removal is the tripartite test in Toth v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1988), 86 N.R. 302 (F.C.A).
