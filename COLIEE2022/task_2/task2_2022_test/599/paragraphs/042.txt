[42]
I am satisfied that, given the complex and unique nature of the statutory scheme for the levying and collection of income tax, it is a clear inference from the statutory provisions to which I have referred that Parliament has "otherwise provided" for prescription, and that s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
accordingly does not apply to the collection of a debt arising under s. 222 of the
Income Tax Act
.
