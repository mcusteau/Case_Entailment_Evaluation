Counsel for the applicant, Mr. Worland, had some difficulty in articulating the injustice that his client would suffer if the Minister were permitted to issue requirements to pay, or to take other statutory collection measures, more than six years after the applicant's tax liability had been assessed. The applicant had been assessed promptly and had had an opportunity to challenge these assessments soon enough after the income had been earned to enable him to produce any relevant evidence. In fact, he has never disputed the assessments. His financial inability to pay the arrears would have prevented him from discharging his pre-1986 tax debts earlier, thus avoiding the large amount of interest that has been charged to him. At best, the applicant could be said to have been entitled in 1992 to the peace of mind that comes from knowing that the Minister of National Revenue could no longer pursue him for an old debt.
