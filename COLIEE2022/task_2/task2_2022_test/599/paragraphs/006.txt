From 1992 the applicant reported income on his tax returns; in some years he was late in paying the amount for which he was assessed. After making payments in respect of those years, he received a statement of account in September 1993 showing the balance owing to Revenue Canada as $0.00. In the years 1995 to 1997 he again fell into arrears, and requirements to pay were issued to debtors informing them of the tax owing by the taxpayer and requiring them to pay to Revenue Canada money that they owed to the applicant. During the period 1995 to 1997, the statements of account sent to the applicant, and the requirements to pay issued to its creditors, showed him as owing only the tax due in respect of those years, not the larger amount owing from the years before 1986.
