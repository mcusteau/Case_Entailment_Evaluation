Support for this view, albeit in a rather different context, can be found in
Mark v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans)
(1991), 50 F.T.R. 157 (T.D.), where Cullen, J., held that the suspension of a commercial fishing licence for allegedly breaching fishery regulations was not "a proceeding in any cause or matter" that could be the subject of a stay by the court pursuant to s. 50 of the
Federal Court Act
, even though the Minister could presumably have instituted proceedings in court for any breach of the regulations.
