[34]
My conclusion on this point is sufficient to dismiss the application, but out of deference to the thorough arguments presented by counsel, and in case I am wrong, I shall now consider whether the applicant has established that the other element of s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
is satisfied.
(ii)
Does the
Income Tax Act
exclude the application of s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
?
