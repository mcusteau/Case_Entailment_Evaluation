The question here is whether the British Columbia
Limitation
Act
applies to attempts by the Crown to collect tax due under the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
outside the limitation period prescribed by the
Limitation Act
. Under the
British Columbia-Canada Tax Collection Agreement
(Memorandum of Agreement between The Minister of Finance, Government of Canada and the Minister of Finance, Province of British Columbia, dated August 23, 1984, amending an earlier agreement, pursuant to s. 7(2) of the
Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act
(R.S. 1985, c. F-8) [as amended] and s. 69(2) of the
Income Tax Act
of British Columbia) the federal Crown collects tax owing under the provincial
Income Tax Act
as agent for the provincial authorities.
