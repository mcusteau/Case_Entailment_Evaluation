A similar inference was drawn in
Bri√®re v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission
(1988), 93 N.R. 115; 57 D.L.R.(4th) 402 (F.C.A.), where the statute prescribed specific limitation periods within which the Commission could recover benefits paid in error to those not entitled. Having failed to comply with the notice provisions under the
Unemployment Insurance Act
, which were relevant to the running of the limitation period, the Commission was not able to rely upon a provision in the
Civil Code of Lower Canada
governing prescription periods in general.
