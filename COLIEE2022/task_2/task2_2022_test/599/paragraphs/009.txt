The respondent made a preliminary objection to the court's jurisdiction to enter足tain this proceeding. The argument was that only a "decision or order" may be the subject of an application for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
. The letter written on behalf of the Minister, which is identified in the applicant's originating notice of motion as the subject of the ap足plication for judicial review, was simply informative in nature and did not purport to determine or otherwise affect any legal rights or duties of the applicant. It was not a "de足cision or order", and was therefore un足reviewable by this court. Indeed, on very similar facts to those at bar, this was the conclusion reached by Teitelbaum, J., in
Fuchs v. Minister of National Revenue
, [1997] 2 C.T.C. 246; 129 F.T.R. 68 (T.D.).
