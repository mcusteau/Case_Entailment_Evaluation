Similarly, in
Price (E.H.) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue
, [1983] 2 F.C. 841; 47 N.R. 312 (F.C.A.) the Federal Court of Appeal held that the registration in the Federal Court by the Minister of National Revenue of a certificate of indebtedness was a "proceeding by the Crown" for the purpose of the then s. 38(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, which prescribed the limitation period applicable to proceedings by and against the Crown. And in
Twinriver Timber Ltd. v. R.
(1980), 25 B.C.L.R. 175 (C.A.), affing. (1979), 15 B.C.L.R. 38 (S.C.) the British Columbia Court of Appeal concluded that the filing of a certificate of default for taxes due constituted an "action" within the meaning of s. 1 of the provincial
Limitation Act
and that therefore the six year limitation period was applicable.
