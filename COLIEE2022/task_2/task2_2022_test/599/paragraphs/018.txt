More recently, however, the courts have developed other interpretative approaches or principles that undoubtedly limit the influence previously exercised by the presumption requiring a narrow interpretation of tax legislation in favour of the taxpayer. The following passage from the judgment of Gonthier, J., in
Québec (Communauté urbaine) et autres v. Corporation Notre-Dame de Bon-Secours
, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 3; 171 N.R. 161; 63 Q.A.C. 161, at pp. 17-18 [S.C.R.] provides authoritative guidance to the current interpretation of tax legislation:
"... there is no longer any doubt that the introduction of tax legislation should be subject to the ordinary rules of construction. At page 872 of his text
Construction of Statutes
(2nd.
Ed. 1983), Driedger fittingly summarizes the basic principles: '... the words of an
Act
are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the
Act
, the object of the
Act
, and the intention of Parliament'. The first consideration should therefore be to determine the purpose of the legislation, whether as a whole or as expressed in a particular provision.

"The teleological approach makes it clear that in tax matters it is no longer possible to reduce the rules of interpretation to presumptions in favour of or against the taxpayer or to well-defined categories known to require a liberal, strict or literal interpretation. ..."
