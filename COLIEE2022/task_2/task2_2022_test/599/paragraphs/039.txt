Counsel for the respondent took me through a large number of provisions in the
Income Tax Act
that impose a time limit on other aspects in the assessment and collection of tax. The provision that seemed to me of most direct assistance is s. 225.1, which prohibits the collection of tax until the expiry of the 90 days within which the taxpayer may appeal an assessment. The existence of this provision supports an inference from the absence of a prescribed time
after
which no collection can be made that Parliament intended that there should be no such limitation period.
