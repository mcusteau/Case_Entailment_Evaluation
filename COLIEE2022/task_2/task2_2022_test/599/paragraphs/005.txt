"Writing-off" a tax debt does not extinguish or forgive it; it is an internal book-keeping device that removes a taxÂ­payer's tax debt from Revenue Canada's active collection list. Section 25(3) of the
Financial Administration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-11 [as amended] provides that "[t]he writing off of any debt, obligation or claim pursuant to this section does not affect any right of Her Majesty to collect or recover the debt, obligation or claim."
