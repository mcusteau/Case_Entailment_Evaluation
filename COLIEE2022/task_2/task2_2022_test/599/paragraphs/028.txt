The absence of the words, "in the court", from s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
arguably makes s. 32 broader in scope than s. 38(2) of the
Federal Court Act
that was considered in
E.H. Price Ltd.
In an attempt to refute this argument, counsel for the respondent submitted that the words, "in the court", are merely formulaic in nature and are found throughout the
Federal Court Act
, where their function is simply to limit the application of its provisions to the Federal Court of Canada.
