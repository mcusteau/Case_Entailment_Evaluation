In this case there appear to be two principal consequences of concluding that the cause of action arises in a province and that the applicable limitation period is that contained in the British Columbia
Limitation Act
. First, s. 1 of that
Act
defines the word "action" to which the
Act
applies as meaning, "any proceeding in a court and any exercise of a self help remedy". The applicant argues that the issue of a statutory requirement to pay must fall under one or the other branch of this broad definition of the word "action", and that if they are not a "proceeding in a court", they must be a "self help remedy". Second, the
Limitation Act
provides in s. 9(3) that a time-barred debt is
extinguished
; most limitation statutes merely make the debt unenforceable by proceedings instituted in court.
