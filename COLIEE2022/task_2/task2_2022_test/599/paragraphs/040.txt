In addition, I attach some importance to the fact that s. 152(1) of the
Income Tax Act
requires the Minister, on the receipt of the taxpayer's return, to examine the return and assess the tax payable "with all due dispatch". This provision ensures that in most cases taxpayers are assessed soon enough after the end of the year in which the income was earned and the return filed, so that the evidence required to challenge the assessment is still likely to be fresh. The fact that the court has held in
Minister of National Revenue v. Ginsberg
(1996), 198 N.R. 148; 96 D.T.C. 6372 (F.C.A.), reving. 94 D.T.C. 1430 (T.C.C.) and
Stollar (J.) Construction Ltd. v. Minister of Revenue
(1989), 89 D.T.C. 134 (T.C.C.) that a failure by Revenue Canada to comply with s. 152(1) does not invalidate the assessment is not inconsistent with Parliament's intention that assessments are to be made promptly.
