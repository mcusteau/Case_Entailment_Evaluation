Having heard virtually nothing about this debt in any of his communications with Revenue Canada since 1986, and having neither acknowledged nor made any pay­ments in respect of this indebtedness since 1986, the applicant was taken aback when he received this information in January 1998. In particular, he feared that the inclusion of this large amount in any requirements to pay that Ms. Kara indicated would be issued to his debtors would be extremely damaging to him in the conduct of his business. However, it should also be noted that in August 1996 the applicant had been told that the as­sessment notice issued for the tax year 1993 did not include a previously unpaid tax liability and that a detailed statement would follow. It did not.
