The British Columbia
Interpretation Act
, R.S.B.C., c. 238 reverses the common law presumption that statutes do not bind the Crown in the absence of express words or necessary implication. Section 14(1) of that
Act
provides:
"Unless it specifically provides otherwise an enactment is binding on the government."
The question then is whether "the government" includes a Minister of the federal Crown when exercising on behalf of the provincial government a power under a provincial statute.
