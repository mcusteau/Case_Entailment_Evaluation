Although not directly relevant to this application, the logic of the respondent's position is that, since it can be inferred from other provisions in, and the overall structure of, the
Income Tax Act
that s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
is excluded, the Crown may attempt to collect a tax debt outside the general statutory limitation periods either by one of the statutory collection methods, as here, or by an action for debt. Surprising as it may seem that the Crown's action for debt would not be statute barred, this does seem to be a logical consequence of the respondent's argument. While this consideration has given me some pause, I have decided that it does not tip the balance in favour of the applicant's position.
