The respondent's submission on the limiting effect of the words "with respect to a cause of action" seems to me persuasive. Nor is it weakened by the fact that limitations statutes may apply both to the initiation of proceedings in court, and to attempts to execute judgments. This is because a judgment is obtained as a result of a litigant's pursuing a cause of action, and the execution of a judgment can therefore readily be characterized as a measure taken "with respect to a cause of action".
