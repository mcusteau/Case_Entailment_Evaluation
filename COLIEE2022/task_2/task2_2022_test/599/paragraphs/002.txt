The question comes before me in the form of an application for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 [as amended]. The subject matter of the application is a letter of January 15th, 1998 written to the applicant by Ms. Nasim Kara of the Revenue Canada office in Richmond, British Columbia, in­forming the applicant that he owes more than $770,583.42 in unpaid taxes. The ap­plicant requests a declaration that this amount is not owing and an order restraining the Minister from issuing requirements to pay to the applicant's debtors.
