[59]
In my opinion, therefore, the
Income Tax Act
should be interpreted as creating a federal cause of action in the event that a taxpayer fails to pay tax duly assessed. Accordingly, if a general limitation period were applicable to the Crown's ability to collect tax through any of the statutory collection methods, it would be the six year period prescribed by s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, and not that contained in the limitation statute of the province where the taxpayer resided.
