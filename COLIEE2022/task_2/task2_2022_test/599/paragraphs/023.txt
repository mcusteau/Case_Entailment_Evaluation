The applicant's first argument was that s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
applies to anything that is a "proceeding", and that the phrase "in respect of a cause of action" only modifies the words that follow it, namely, "arising in a province" or, when relevant, "otherwise than in a province". He then relied on cases where it has been said that "proceedings" is a word of the broadest connotation and is not confined to measures taken in court or as a step in the initiation or prosecution of litigation.
