The words, "in the court", should therefore not be read in the former s. 38(1) of the
Federal Court Act
as imposing any kind of limit on the concept of a "proceeding with respect to a cause of action", other than to locate it in the Federal Court of Canada. Thus, the conclusion in
E.H. Price Ltd.
that the registration of a certificate under the
Excise Act
was not a "proceeding in the court with respect to a cause of action" disposes of the applicant's contention that a requirement to pay is a "proceeding with respect to a cause of action" for the purpose of s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
.
