I should note that I did not find particularly helpful the statements in
English, Scottish and Australian Bank Ltd. v. Commissioners of Inland Revenue
, [1932] A.C. 238 (H.L.)to the effect that a debt must have a "local situation" and that this will normally be where the debtor resides. The context of that case was very different, relating as it did to whether a debt was "property locally situate out of the United Kingdom" for the purpose of being exempted from stamp duty. Moreover, it did not speak at all to the federalism aspect of the issue raised by the case at bar which may call for a different approach to "locating" a debt.
