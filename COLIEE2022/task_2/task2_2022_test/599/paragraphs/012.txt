However, in order to qualify as an "act or proceeding" that is subject to judicial review, the administrative action impugned must be an "act or proceeding" of a "federal, board, commission or tribunal", that is a body or person "having, exercising or pur­porting to exercise jurisdiction or powers conferred by or under an Act of Parliament" (s. 2(1) of the
Federal Court Act
). While the letter written on the Minister's behalf to the applicant that is the subject-matter of this application for judicial review was not an act or proceeding by a federal body in the
exer­cise
of any statutory power, the Minister, of course, is a person
having
statutory powers under the
Income Tax Act
.
