[63]
To a large extent, the assessment and collection provisions of the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
have been amended so as to harmonize with those contained in the federal
Income Tax Act
. For example, the requirement to pay provisions in the federal
Income Tax Act
(s. 224(1)) are incorporated by reference in s. 67 of the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
. And ss. 69(2) and (3) of the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
authorize the Minister and Deputy Minister of National Revenue of Canada to exercise the various powers relating to the collection of tax conferred by the
Act
on the British Columbia minister.
