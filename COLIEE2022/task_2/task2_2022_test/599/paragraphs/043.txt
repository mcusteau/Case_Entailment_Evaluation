The courts have often accepted that taxing statutes constitute complete codes into which the legislature did not intend them to import general legal principles, rules or remedies. For example, in
Marcel Grand Cirque Inc. v. Qu√©bec (Sous-ministre du Revenu)
(1995), 107 F.T.R. 18, 21 (T.D.), this court held that it had no jurisdiction to entertain a motion in revocation of judgment in respect of a certificate filed with the court in which the taxpayer sought to challenge the assessment of tax on which the certificate was based:
"The
Excise Tax Act
, like the
Income Tax Act
, ... contains in effect a complete code for the collection of taxes pursuant to which a taxpayer, after receiving a notice of assessment, may file a notice of opposition and possibly appeal to the Tax Court of Canada."
