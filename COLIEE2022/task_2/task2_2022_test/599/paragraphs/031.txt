Counsel for the respondent also argued that, by their very nature, statutory limitation periods operate as defences raised to proceedings taken in the course of litigation. A requirement to pay is not issued as a result of any court process and therefore statutes of limitation are simply irrelevant to the timing of its issuance. While the applicant's failure to pay tax due undoubtedly created a cause of action in the respondent, the respondent had elected not to pursue that cause of action, but to have resort to one of the statutory debt collection tools provided by the
Income Tax Act
. The existence of an uninvoked cause of action is not sufficient to render the issue of a requirement to pay a proceeding "with respect to a cause of action".
