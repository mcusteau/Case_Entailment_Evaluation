In my opinion, therefore, the relevant question at this stage of the inquiry is whether the issue of a requirement to pay is a "proceeding with respect to a cause of action". Returning to

. However, the court also said that the registration was not a "proceeding
in the court
with respect to a cause of action" for the purpose of the limitation period prescribed by s. 38(1).
