Even though not taken in the exercise of a statutory power, administrative action by a person
having
statutory powers may be reviewable as an "act or proceeding" under paragraph 18.1(3)(b) if it affects the rights or interests of individuals. The letter in question here contained no decision made pursuant to a statutory power, nor did it explicitly pur­port adversely to affect any right or interest of the applicant. However, it is a reasonable inference from both the letter, and the ap­plicant's communications with Ms. Kara, the writer of the letter, that it signified that Revenue Canada had made a decision to try to collect the unpaid tax and intended to take measures to attempt to recover the pre­viously "written-off" tax debt. And, as is apparent from the requirements to pay that were subsequently issued, this was indeed the case.
