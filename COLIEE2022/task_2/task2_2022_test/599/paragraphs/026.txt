The difficulty that I have with this argument is that it depends upon reading the words of s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
in an artificial and compartmentalized fashion. It seems to me that a more natural interpretation of the words "proceeding with respect to a cause of action arising in a province" is that they constitute a single concept, so that each of the components limits what precedes it. Thus, the phrase "with respect to a cause of action" limits the scope of the word "proceeding", and "arising in a province" locates the "cause of action".
