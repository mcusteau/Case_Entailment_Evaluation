The appropriate test in this situation is whether the prothonotary gave reasonable consideration to the relevant evidence and arguments and reached a conclusion supported by them. In
Roebuck v. Canada (Registrar of Trademarks)
(1987), 13 C.P.R.(3d) 384 (F.C.T.D.), Collier, J., made the following comments with respect to appeals from prothonotary's orders at p. 384:
"It must be remembered, this is an appeal from the decision of the prothonotary. It is not a trial de novo. The prothonotary had a discretion to extend the time for appeal in the manner he did. It must be shown that the prothonotary exercised his discretion on a wrong principle, or on a complete misapprehension of the facts, or for some other compelling reason requiring interference by a judge sitting in an appellate position."
