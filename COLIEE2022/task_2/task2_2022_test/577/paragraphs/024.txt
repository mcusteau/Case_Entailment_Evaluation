[24]
From the first day of this contempt hearing, both parties were aware of the exposure to substantial costs for the unsuccessful party. The defendants' counsel, in particular, made a clear statement to this effect. Further, again from the outset of the contempt hearing, the plaintiffs understood that the former
Federal Court Rules
would be applicable. As a result, the parties understood that this proceeding was subject to a maximum monetary fine of $5,000. However, the plaintiffs made it clear that they would be seeking multiple fines on the basis of the number of shipments made in breach of the injunction.
