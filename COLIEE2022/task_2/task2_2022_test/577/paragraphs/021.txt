In
Pfizer Canada Inc. et al. v. Apotex Inc. et al.
(1998), 162 F.T.R. 169; 86 C.P.R.(3d) 33 (T.D.), Justice Hugessen noted that the policy underlying the practice of awarding costs on a solicitor and client basis in matters of contempt of court is clear: "... a party who assists the court in the enforcement of its orders and in the enforcement of respect for its orders, should not, as a rule, be put out of pocket for having been put to that trouble". In that case, the costs awarded were less than 10% of the total amount owed on a solicitor and client basis. This result took into account the particular circumstances of that case and assured that the award of costs did not take the form of undue punishment.
