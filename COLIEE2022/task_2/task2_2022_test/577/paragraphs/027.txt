On June 11, 1998, after all the witnesses were heard except for the testimony obtained on commission on August 24, 1998, the plaintiffs made this offer to settle:
"1. The defendant, Musadiq Pardhan, shall admit to directly and indirectly breaching the terms of the interlocutory injunction Order of Mr. Justice MacKay dated January 8, 1996 and accept liability for contempt of that Order;
"2. The defendant, Musadiq Pardhan, shall pay to the Federal Court of Canada a fine in the amount of $4,000 Cdn. (Four thousand dollars Canadian);
"3. The defendant, Musadiq Pardhan, shall forthwith pay costs to the plaintiffs on a party and party scale, in respect of the show cause hearing before Mr. Justice Lutfy and all matters and motions incidental thereto, including the motions for the Show Cause Order and the Anton Piller Order (both dated July 29, 1997), other motions relating to the Anton Piller Order and the execution thereof; and all reasonable disbursements (including investigative costs) relating to all of the above-referenced matters;"
In addition, counsel indicated at the time of the offer that the plaintiffs would no longer seek an admission of liability for contempt of court or the payment of costs from the defendant Mustafa Pardhan. This offer was open for acceptance until July 10, 1998.
