The court's findings of fact reflect the general terms of the show cause order. Sid Enterprise exported 39 shipments which included Coca-Cola products. Musadiq Pardhan's correspondence concerning the six shipments to Bay Harbour Trading in April and May 1997, constitutes part of the evidence of his direct involvement in the exportation of Coca-Cola products by Sid Enterprise. There is no more specific finding of fact concerning Musadiq Pardhan's direct involvement in the total number of shipments by Sid Enterprise than there was alleged in the show cause order.
