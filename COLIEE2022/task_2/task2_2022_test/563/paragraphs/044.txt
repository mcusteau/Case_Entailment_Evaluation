The jurisprudence on state protection in the context of domestic abuse says that the Board must look at the particular circumstances of the claim and determine whether effective protection can be provided. Of course, if a claimant has attempted to obtain state protection in the past and it had been refused, this will raise a strong inference that protection will not be available in the future. But that is not determinative, particularly in a situation where seeking state protection would place the claimant's life in danger.
