It is trite law that, on an application for judicial review, this Court should not substitute its decision for that of the Board. In any judicial review of the factual determinations of a lower tribunal such as the Board, the primary question to be asked is whether the finding was one that could reasonably have been made on the evidence before the Board. If the finding is reasonable, it must stand and review must only take place where the findings of fact may be construed as perverse, capricious or made without regard to the material before it (Federal Courts Act, R.S., 1985, c. F-7, s. 18.1(4)(d)).
