The Applicant says that the test used by the Board to determine adequate state protection was erroneous. The requirement in Villafranca of total breakdown as the condition for the absence of state protection was overruled in Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689. The Applicant argues that Convention refugee status is established if she can demonstrate that, despite best efforts by the state, it cannot provide adequate protection, particularly where there is also evidence that she is likely to suffer more serious negative consequences. The Applicant says that she presented clear evidence establishing that the police cannot protect her. Her persecutor was already known to the police as a drug user and dealer, yet the police could do nothing. The Board erred when it ignored this vital evidence supporting the absence of state protection.
