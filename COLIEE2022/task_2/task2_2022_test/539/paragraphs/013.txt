I note that the issues raised and the submissions made in this case are not heavily dependent on the facts set out in the Affidavit of the Applicant. The lack of confirmation of translation might, if the facts were in dispute in a material way, lead me to conclude that this application should be dismissed. However, in this particular situation, I will adopt the approach of Muldoon, J., in
Momcilovic
, supra and give no weight to the Applicant's Affidavit because there is no indication that the Applicant understood what she was signing when she swore her Affidavit.
Issue #2: Did the visa officer err in her assessment of the Applicant under the definition of self-employed person in the
Immigration Regulations
?
