I have concluded the Ontario legislation, without more, does not clothe this court with jurisdiction to hear this action against his particular defendant. The statute removes the former common law provincial Crown immunity from liability in tort, and imposes liability, in certain cases, as if the Crown were an ordinary person. The legislation permits the Ontario Crown to be sued in those situations. But, in my view, the liability to suit is confined to the courts of the province of Ontario. For the provincial Crown to be sued in this court, there must, as I see it, be some legislative provision permitting suits, based on s. 5, to be brought against Ontario in the Federal Court.
