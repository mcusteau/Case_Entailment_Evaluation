In the Union Oil case, there was, at that time, no provincial legislation comparable to the Ontario legislation relied on here. I set out the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal as well as the note of the judgment given by the Supreme Court of Canada:
"The judgment of the court was delivered orally by
"THURLOW, J.A.:--We have decided not to call on counsel for the respondents. At the same time our taking this course should not be interpreted as reflecting any disrespect for the very able and comprehensive argument addressed to us by Mr. Dickerson.
"We do not necessarily adopt the reasons of the learned trial judge and in particular we do not adopt his view that fraud or deceit are necessary to a claim founded on ss. 70(1) of the Excise Tax Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-13. But we are not persuaded that he erred in striking out the claim against the Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia.
"The jurisdiction of the Federal Court is entirely statutory and, accepting that it lies within the powers of the Parliament of Canada, when legislating in a field within its competence, to give the Federal Court jurisdiction to implead the Crown in right of a Province, we do not think any of the statutory provisions to which we were referred, or any others of which we are aware, authorize the court to entertain a proceeding at the suit or a subject against the Crown in right of a Province.
"The provisions of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. 10 (2nd Supp.), conferring jurisdiction on the court by reference to subject-matter are, without doubt, broadly expressed but we think that s. 16 of the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-23, though somewhat reworded since the judgment of the Privy Council in Re Silver Bros. Ltd., A.-G. Que. v. A.-G. Can., [1932] 2 D.L.R. 673; [1932] 1 W.W.R. 764; [1932] A.C. 514, and the interpretation put upon that provision, as it then was, by that judgment coupled with the specific definition and references in the Federal Court Act to the Crown in right of Canada are sufficient to show that the traditional immunity of the Crown in right of the Provinces from suit in its courts was not intended to be abrogated by the general descriptions of subject-matter of jurisdiction in the Federal Court Act.
"It should not be taken that we are not sympathetic to the unforunate position in which the appellant finds itself but we are of the opinion that the court is without jurisdiction to entertain the claim against the Crown in right of the Province of British Columbia and that the appeal accordingly fails and must be dimissed.
Appeal Dismissed.
"NOTE: An appeal from the above decision to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed (Laskin, C.J.C., Martland, Judson, Ritchie, Spence, Pigeon, Dickson, Beetz and de Grandpr√©, JJ.) December 9, 1976. The following judgment was delivered orally for the court by
"LASKIN, C.J.C.:--We do not need to hear the respondents or the intervenor. We are all of the opinion that the appellant has failed to show any ground of jurisdiction in the Federal Court over the Crown in right of British Columbia in this case. It is unnecessary therefore to deal with the question of that Crown's immunity. The appeal accordingly fails and will be dismissed with costs to the Crown in right of British Columbia. There will be no order as to costs in favour of the Crown in right of Canada or of the intervenor, the Attorney-General of Ontario."
