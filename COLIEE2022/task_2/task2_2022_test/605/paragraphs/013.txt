It is useful to clarify what onus lies on the applicant to rebut the presumption of state protection by returning to first principles. In Ward, supra, LaForest J. noted that the claimant's subjective fear of persecution was not at issue; "the issue," he said was, "whether the fear is objectively justifiable", and that inquiry required an examination into the (non)existence of state protection. He then went on to describe when and how a state's inability to protect can be demonstrated at pages 724-25:
"The issue that arises, then, is how, in a practical sense, a claimant makes proof of a state's inability to protect its nationals as well as the reasonable nature of the claimant's refusal actually to seek out this protection. On the facts of this case, proof on this point was unnecessary, as representatives of the state authorities conceded their inability to protect Ward.
Where such an admission is not available, however, clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided. For example, a claimant might advance testimony of similarly situated individuals let down by the state protection arrangement or the claimant's testimony of past personal incidents in which state protection did not materialize
. Absent some evidence, the claim should fail, as nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. [...]" [Emphasis added]
