Regarding the Applicant’s corroborating documents, while it is open to the Board to assign little weight to the documents such a decision must be supportable especially, as in this case, where there is no allegation that the documents are fraudulent in any way. In respect of the letter from Mr. Azam, the Board relies on the Applicant’s supposition that Mr. Azam probably came to know of the current situation for the Applicant’s family from the Applicant’s uncle to impugn the entire letter, including Mr. Azam’s statement that the Applicant was targeted by the BNP-Jamaat, which led the Applicant to leave Bangladesh. The Board does not provide any other reason for questioning the genuineness of the content of Mr. Assam’s letter. In my opinion, the Board’s reason for discounting Mr. Azam’s letter is not sound. I note that the Board does not dispute that Mr. Azam and the Applicant knew each other personally during the time that the Applicant was politically active with the BCL. It is plausible that Mr. Azam would be aware on his own that the Applicant was being targeted by BNP goons. It is also plausible, therefore, that the source of that information was not the Applicant’s uncle. While I agree that the information Mr. Azam had about the Applicant’s family’s current situation likely came from the Applicant’s uncle when he asked Mr. Azam to write the letter, in my view, this does not discredit the evidence of Mr. Azam regarding the Applicant’s political activities with the BCL and the targeting by the BNP that allegedly ensued. In respect of the medical report from Dr. Chowdhury, in my view, it is plausible that Dr. Chowdhury would not have stated the alleged cause of the Applicant’s wound in his report. I note that during the hearing neither the RPO nor the Board specifically asked the Applicant about the medical report including whether he had told Dr. Chowdhury how he sustained the wound.
