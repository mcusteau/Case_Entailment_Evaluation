I do not believe that these factors are sufficient to justify the Decision. The Board found no inconsistencies, contradictions or omissions in the evidence that the Applicant did provide. In fact, the Board appears to have disregarded the evidence that the Applicant provided and to have relied almost entirely upon its own sense of what is plausible and what is not. And, on the delay factor, the Tribunal Record at pages 371 and 385 makes it clear that the issue of delay was not raised and the Board did not want questions on it.
