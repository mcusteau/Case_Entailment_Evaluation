In my view, these errors made by the Board in reaching its conclusion that the incidents alleged by the Applicant did not occur are sufficient to warrant the Court’s intervention. In fact, the Board’s determination that the Applicant’s allegation that he was targeted by BNP goons is not credible was the basis for undermining much of the other supporting documents and evidence provided by the Applicant. For example, this finding led the Board to state that it did not believe that the December 1, 2003 incident – in which BNP goons allegedly came to the Applicant’s parent’s house looking for the Applicant – occurred, nor that the Applicant’s parents are in hiding.
