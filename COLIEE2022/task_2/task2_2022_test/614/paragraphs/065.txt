In reviewing the record before the Board, I find there to be documentary evidence that it is not only persons who are in leadership positions with the AL who are vulnerable to attacks by the BNP government and goons. For example, the Response for Information (RFI) Request, BGD40168.E dated December 9, 2002 (see page 115A of the Certified Tribunal Record), provides evidence that opponents of the BNP – which includes ordinary members and supporters of the AL – have been arrested and detained by BNP authorities and attacked by its goons. The RFI Request states that a BBC article published on September 1, 2002 reports that “nearly 300” AL supporters were arrested by Bangladeshi police hours before a nation-wide general strike was held. The leader of the AL, Sheikh Hasina, is also reported as alleging that the BNP-Jamaat-Shibir cadres are unleashing terrorism across the country and that the government is filing “false cases” against AL workers. Moreover, Amnesty International is reported as calling on the government to stop using politically motivated criminal charges to harass members of the opposition. The September 6, 2002 report of Amnesty International (see page 115E of the Certified Tribunal Record) indicates that the SPA – which was promulgated by the AL government of Sheikh Mujubur in 1974 – is being used to detain members of opposition parties and that each year thousands of people have been detained under the SPA.
