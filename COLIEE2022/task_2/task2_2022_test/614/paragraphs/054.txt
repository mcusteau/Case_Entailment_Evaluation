Regarding the Applicant’s delay in making a refugee claim in Canada, the Respondent submits that, on the evidence, it was open to the Board to conclude that on a balance of probabilities the Applicant’s marks were not good enough to allow him to continue his studies and that he was seeking another way to stay in Canada. In particular, the Respondent notes that, at the hearing, the Applicant did not know whether the University of Windsor would allow him to continue his studies there; this indicates that he had simply dropped out of school after December 2003.
