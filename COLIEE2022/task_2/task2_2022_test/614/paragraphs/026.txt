The Supreme Court of Canada has held that assessments of credibility are “quintessentially findings of fact” and that tribunals should be afforded greater deference because they enjoy a relative advantage of hearing the viva voce evidence: see Dr. Q. v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226 at paragraph 38. In Chowdhury v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 2006 FC 139 at paragraph 12, Justice Simon Noël recently affirmed that the appropriate standard for reviewing the Board’s credibility findings is patent unreasonableness:
The decision of the RPD as to the Applicant’s entitlement to refugee protection is primarily based on the credibility of his allegations. It is well established that the standard of review as to the assessment of credibility of an applicant by the RPD is patent unreasonableness (see Thavarathinam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1469, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1866 (F.C.A.), at para. 10; Aguebor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 732 (F.C.A.) at para. 4).
