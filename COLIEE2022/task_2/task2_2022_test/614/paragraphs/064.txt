I note that the Board does not dispute the Applicant’s assertion that he is a member of the BCL or that he produced posters and leaflets criticizing the BNP which were distributed during and after the October 2001 election. However, the Board finds the Applicant’s refugee claim not credible because of an absence of “independent evidence” that persons distributing posters and leaflets for the AL are being targeted by the BNP government and goons, as well as the Applicant’s own testimony that he was not targeted during the election or during Operation Clean Heart.
