The Applicant replies to the Respondent’s contentions and says that the Board failed to give any reasons for rejecting his evidence that he had problems as a result of his creating and distributing materials on behalf of the AL. Rather, the Board’s only reason was that he was not targeted during Operation Clean Heart. The Applicant submits that the documentary evidence does not support a finding that because a person was not arrested during Operation Clean Heart it means that he or she is not at risk of targeting by the BNP goons.
