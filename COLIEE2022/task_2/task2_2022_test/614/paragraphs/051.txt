Regarding the police reports, the Respondent contends that it was reasonably open to the Board to make a negative credibility finding from the Applicantâ€™s failure to produce any evidence to substantiate his assertion that his father made several complaints to the police on his behalf. The Respondent also submits that the Board was entitled to comment on the First Information Reports without citing a source or giving notice to the Applicant under Rule 18. This is because such knowledge is clearly drawn from the experience of the Board acquired in hearing claims from Bangladesh (see Bula v. Canada (Secretary of State), [1996] F.C.J. No. 876 (QL) (C.A.)).
