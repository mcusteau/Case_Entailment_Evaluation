Specifically with respect to the December 1, 2003 incident, the Board did not accept the Applicant’s explanation that his father would not tell the BNP goons that his son was out of the country because the goons might still make the Applicant’s life miserable. The Board found that there was nothing to be gained from the father concealing this information. Consequently, the Board held that this incident did not occur. In fact, the Board concluded that the Applicant’s parents were not forced to move after this alleged incident, at least not for the reason stated by the Applicant – i.e. that the BNP goons were threatening to harm him. The Board held that “this whole aspect of the [Applicant’s] story was fabricated to bolster his claim.”
