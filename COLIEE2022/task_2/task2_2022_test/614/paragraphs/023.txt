Regarding the issue of delay in claiming refugee status in Canada, the Board held that, based on its finding that the December 1, 2003 incident involving his parents did not occur, the reason the Applicant filed a refugee claim was that his marks were not good enough to allow him to continue studying at the University of Windsor. The Board commented that, despite the alleged beating in August 15, 2002, the Applicant said he was not interested in going abroad at the time. Nonetheless, the Board noted that the Applicant had acquired a passport in September 2002 and wrote the TOEFL examination in November 2002. He subsequently came to Canada on a student visa and did not claim refugee protection right away.
