With respect to plausibility findings that underlie conclusions related to the credibility of a refugee claim, the Federal Court of Appeal held in Aguebor at paragraph 4 that, as a specialized tribunal, the Board has “complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony”:
… who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. ...
Thus, the appropriate standard for reviewing the Board’s plausibility findings in the present case is patent unreasonableness.
