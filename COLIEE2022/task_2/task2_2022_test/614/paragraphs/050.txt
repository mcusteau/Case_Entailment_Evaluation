The Respondent argues that it was open to the Board to find the Applicant was no more vulnerable to targeting than other members of the AL who also distributed posters and leaflets. Mere membership in the AL is not sufficient in itself to support a serious possibility of persecution or risk to life. The Respondent notes that even after it lost the election, the AL – as one of the largest political parties in Bangladesh – continued to wield significant political power. Further, the Respondents says there was nothing erroneous in the Board’s pointing to the lack of independent evidence that persons who distributed posters and leaflets were persecuted by BNP goons.
