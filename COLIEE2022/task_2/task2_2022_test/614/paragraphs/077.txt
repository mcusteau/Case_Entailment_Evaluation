[77]
This is one of those rare occasions when the Court must interfere with a decision based upon credibility. The Applicant has raised a vast number of concerns with the Decision. As I have indicated, I agree with the Applicantâ€™s conclusions on most points. Taken cumulatively they render the Decision patently unreasonable and I can find no line of reasoning on evidentiary basis upon which the Decision can stand.
