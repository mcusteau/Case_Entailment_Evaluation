The Applicant submits that the Board’s reasoning with respect to its credibility finding’s is patently unreasonable. In support of his position, he says that this Court has established clear standards for the assessment of credibility which include the following:
a) When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness (Maldonado v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1980] 2 F.C. 302; Villaroel v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1970), 31 N.R. 50 (F.C.A.); Sathanandan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 15 Imm. L.R. (2d) 310 (F.C.A.); Okyere-Akosah v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 157 N.R. 387 (F.C.A.));
b) When a refugee tribunal rejects a claim on the ground that the claimant is not credible, then it must state the ground clearly and it must give its reasons for the credibility finding. Failure to state such reasons is a reviewable error (Ababio v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1988), 5 Imm. L.R. (2d) 174; Armson v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 9 Imm. L.R. (2d) 150 (F.C.A.); Hilo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 15 Imm. L.R. (2d) 199 (F.C.A.); Okyere-Akosah, above);
c) A tribunal should guard against over-zealousness when attacking the credibility of a refugee claimant, particularly when that claimant has testified through an interpreter. Special caution should be exercised when comparing statements made by a refugee claimant who testified on different occasions through different interpreters (Attakora v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 99 N.R. 168 (F.C.A.); Owusu-Ansah v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 8 Imm. L.R. (2d) 106 (F.C.A.));
d) A tribunal must have regard for the totality of evidence before it when assessing the credibility of a refugee claimant. The tribunal cannot make an adverse credibility finding while ignoring evidence by the claimant explaining apparent inconsistencies (Owusu-Ansah, above; Frimpong v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 8 Imm. L.R. (2d) 183 (F.C.A.));
e) Inferences of credibility must be based on the evidence. If the Board bases its findings on inferences drawn from the evidence, the Court can determine whether or not those inferences were reasonably drawn (Frimpong, above; Giron v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 143 N.R. 238 (F.C.A.));
f) A tribunal cannot base credibility findings on irrelevant considerations (Osusu-Ansah, above; Attakora, above);
g) In making credibility findings, a tribunal cannot take judicial notice of matters which are not the proper subject of judicial notice (Attakora, above; Armson, above);
h) A finding that a claimant is or is not a credible witness is not determinative of the question of whether or not the claimant is a Convention refugee. A claimant is still a refugee, whether credible or not, if he/she satisfies the subjective and objective components of the test for refugee status (Attakora, above; Armson, above); and
i) If the tribunal rejects some of a claimant’s testimony but accepts other aspects, then the tribunal must make a determination as to whether or not, based on the evidence accepted by the tribunal as credible, the person would qualify as a Convention refugee (Yaliniz v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1988), 7 Imm. LR. (2d) 163) (F.C.A.); M.M. v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 15 Imm. L.R. (2d) 29 (F.C.A)).
