Regarding the Board’s finding that it is implausible that the Applicant’s father would not have told the BNP goons that the Applicant was out of the country, the Applicant submits that this finding is patently unreasonable. Aside from the fact that the jurisprudence requires the Board to consider what is plausible in the context of the Applicant’s background and culture (see for example, Divsalar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 653), the Applicant submits that the Board provided no reasonable basis for concluding that the reasonable reaction for the Applicant’s father would have been to inform the BNP that his son was out of the country.
