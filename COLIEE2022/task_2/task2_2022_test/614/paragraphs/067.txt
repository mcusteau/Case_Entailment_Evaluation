Overall, given the above documentary and corroborating evidence, I find that the Board erred in concluding that no independent evidence in support of the Applicant’s contention that ordinary workers and supporters of the AL, like himself – namely, the creators and distributors of posters and pamphlets criticizing the BNP – are being targeted by the BNP government and its goons. Moreover, I am of the opinion that it was patently unreasonable for the Board to reject the basis for the Applicant’s allegation of persecution as it did, given that the Applicant’s own evidence was uncontradicted and that he produced evidence consistent with his claim, namely the letter from Mr. Azam, the medical report from Dr. Chowdhury, and the police complaint filed on May 25, 2003 by the Applicant’s father reporting that someone had called and threatened to hurt the Applicant.
