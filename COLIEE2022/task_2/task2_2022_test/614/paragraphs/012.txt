Among its findings, the Board stated that there was no independent evidence that persons who distributed posters and leaflets are being persecuted by goons in Bangladesh. Because the Applicantâ€™s name was not on any of the posters or leaflets, the Board held that he is at no greater risk than the many other members of the AL who also distributed posters and leaflets. Further, the Board found that the Applicant does not fall within the category of persons usually targeted for politically motivated violence. The Board stated that the documentary evidence indicates that it is the leaders of the AL, at the local and national level, who were left vulnerable to politically motivated arrest and detention after the 2001 election. Finally, the Board noted that, in his own evidence, the Applicant stated that he did not have any problems with BNP goons in the lead up to the election in 2001, or during Operation Clean Heart in October 2002, in which more than 10,000 people were arrested, including members and workers of the opposition and ruling political parties.
