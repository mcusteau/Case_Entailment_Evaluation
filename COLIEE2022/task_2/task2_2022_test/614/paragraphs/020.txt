Third, in reviewing the letter of termination received by the Applicant’s mother, the Board noted that the letter was written in June 2004, six months after, according to the Applicant’s evidence, his parents went into hiding. The Board concluded that the termination of the mother’s employment had nothing to do with the Applicant’s alleged problems with BNP goons. The letter stated that her position was terminated for financial reasons. Moreover, the Board found, on a balance of probabilities, that the Applicant’s father is still teaching.
