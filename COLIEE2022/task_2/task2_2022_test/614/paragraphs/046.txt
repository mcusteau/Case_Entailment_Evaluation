The Respondent says that there was nothing erroneous in the Board’s finding that the Applicant was not directly involved in preparing the contents of the leaflets, or in the Board’s referring to the fact that the Applicant’s name did not appear on the posters or leaflets and doubting his assertion that he was targeted because the materials he produced criticized the BNP. The Respondent argues that the mere fact that the Board was not satisfied with the Applicant’s explanation is not sufficient to render its finding patently unreasonable (see Soto v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1521; Maina v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 381 (QL)).
