With respect to the Board’s treatment of the Applicant’s corroborating evidence, the Respondent contends that the Applicant has not established any overriding error in the Board’s assessment. The Applicant merely takes issue with the weight given to the evidence. As such, the Respondent submits that no intervention by the Court is warranted as the weighing of evidence is at the core of the Board’s jurisdiction (see Olah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCT 382).
