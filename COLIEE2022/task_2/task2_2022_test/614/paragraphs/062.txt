It is clearly within the expertise of the Board to determine whether the Applicant has established that the incidents he alleges to be at the root of his claim for refugee protection have indeed occurred. It is also within the Board’s expertise to consider and weigh the evidence underlying the Applicant’s refugee claim to determine the plausibility of that evidence and the conclusion it is intended to support. For instance, it was open to the Board to note that the letter of termination received by the Applicant’s mother was dated six months after his parents allegedly went into hiding in questioning the bona fides of the Applicant’s allegations of a subjective fear of persecution. However, upon reviewing the record and the Board’s reasons as a whole I am of the opinion that a sufficient number of the Board’s plausibility findings are patently unreasonable and, as such, taint the Board’s overarching conclusion that the Applicant is not being targeted by BNP goons because of his political activities with the BCL and AL. Consequently, I find that the Board committed a reviewable error in dismissing the Applicant’s claim for refugee protection as it did. My reasons are as follows.
