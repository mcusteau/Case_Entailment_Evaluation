In its reasons, the Board faulted the Applicant for not providing corroborating documents of the alleged incidents of targeting by the BNP goons, namely, police reports. Although the Applicant testified that his father went to the police on three or four occasions, he provided a general diary entry for only one incident that occurred on May 25, 2003, in which his father received a telephone call from someone threatening to cut his son to pieces. The Board stated that First Information Reports from the Bangladeshi police are not difficult to obtain, and that the Applicant made insufficient efforts to get such documents. As a result, pursuant to Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, the Board made a negative credibility finding from the Applicantâ€™s failure to provide the Board with corroborating documents.
