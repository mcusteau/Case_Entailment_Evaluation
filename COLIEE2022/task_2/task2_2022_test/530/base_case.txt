Rouleau, J.
[Translation]: The applicant, a citizen of Lebanon, 38 years of age, requests judicial review of the decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of March 4, 1994, which ruled that he was not a refugee within the meaning of the Convention.
[2]
The facts of this case may be summarized as follows.
[3]
The claimant is a Shiite Moslem who was born in Sierra Leone but lived in the village of Bazourieh, in South Lebanon, from the age of six. He left Lebanon in 1975 after the fighting broke out, and returned to Sierra Leone. In December 1984 he returned with his family to live in Lebanon. In September 1987 the applicant joined the militia of the Amal group, thanks to some friends who were already members of this organization; his family was experiencing difficulty in meeting all its needs solely from working the land. Within this group the applicant was a paid chief of liaison, receiving and broadcasting information about the fighting in the area of Tyre. He was also in charge of the supply commissariat of the militia fighters in the Amal group. However, he said he did not participate in combat.
[4]
In 1988 Jihad, the applicant's brother, formed a group to propagandize against Amal; he was threatened and left Lebanon in November 1989. Confronted with this situation, the applicant decided to leave the organization. On November 11, 1989, having worked for about two years for the militia of the Amal movement, he left his village of Bazourieh and went to East Beirut.
[5]
In East Beirut the applicant was recruited by a friend to help supervise one of the barricades held by another militia, that of the Forces Libanaises. The applicant was armed with a pistol and carried out approximately three arrests. The persons he arrested were turned over to higher authorities for interrogation and detention. He worked for close to three years for the militia of the Forces Libanaises.
[6]
In 1991 the Forces Libanaises turned over their weapons to the Lebanese Army deployed in East Beirut. According to the applicant, the Lebanese Army, on the instructions of the Syrians, sought to capture the anti-Syrians to turn them over to the Syrians. He himself feared the Syrians since he had deserted the Amal group; which was said to be allied with them. And he feared the Amal militia after his desertion. He had no alternative, he says, but to leave Lebanon, which he did on January 18, 1993.
[7]
In its decision, the Refugee Division also referred to the following facts.
[8]
The applicant has a British travel document which was issued to him when he was still living in Sierra Leone. This travel document enabled him to travel to CÃ´te d'Ivoire, from October 1986 to November 1986, to Zaire from November 1986 to December 1986, to Nigeria from December 1986 to March 1987 and to Canada from April 1987 to July 1987.
[9]
Was the tribunal right to conclude, in this case, that the applicant is a person covered by paragraph F(a) of article 1 of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
?
[10]
The applicant argues that the Refugee Division committed many errors that have affected its decision. The board members stated that he returned to Lebanon in July 1987 although he did not return until December 1987. Similarly, they exaggerated his participation in the Amal militia and misinterpreted his role within the Forces Libanaises. Furthermore, they concluded without valid reason that he was aware of the fate in store for the people he arrested when he was working for the Forces Libanaises.
[11]
The applicant also argues that the Refugee Division committed a further error in accusing him of being implicated in the executions that occurred in October 1986 and February 1987 when he was still not a member of the Amal militia. While these executions were taking place, the applicant says, he was outside the country. Consequently, since the Division's decision to the effect that he committed crimes against humanity is based only on documents dealing with executions that occurred between October 1986 and February 1987, a period during which he was not on Lebanese territory, the applicant argues that the evidence did not entitle the Division to apply paragraph F(a) of article 1 of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
to this case.
[12]
The respondent argues that the applicant does not warrant the benefit of the international protection afforded by the convention, since this exclusion clause is applicable to a claimant who has never been prosecuted for committing crimes against humanity. The evidence cited by the tribunal concerning the war crimes or crimes against humanity committed by the Amal militia and the Forces Libanaises could give the board members "serious reasons for considering" that the applicant had been an accomplice in crimes against humanity or war crimes.
[13]
The issue in this case is therefore whether the Refugee Division correctly applied the exclusion in paragraph F(a) of article 1 of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
to the applicant.
[14]
Section 2(1) of the
Immigration Act
defines a refugee as follows:
"'Convention refugee' means any persons who
(a) by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion,
(i) is outside the country of the person's nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country, or
(ii) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of the person's former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, is unwilling to return to that country, and
(b) has not ceased to be a Convention refugee by virtue of subs. (2),
but does not include any person to whom the Convention does not apply pursuant to s. E or F of art. 1 thereof, which sections are set out in the schedule to this Act."
[15]
Paragraph F(a) of article 1 of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
states:
"F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
(a) he has committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;"
[16]
To adequately grasp the scope of this exclusion, a brief review of the principles that govern it is desirable.
[17]
The leading judgment on the exclusion of a claimant under paragraph F(a) of article 1 of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
is
Ramirez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1992), 135 N.R. 390 (F.C.A.). In that judgment the Federal Court of Appeal clearly held that the expression "serious reasons for considering" in paragraph 1F(a) establishes a lower standard of proof than the balance of probabilities. MacGuigan, J.A., stated:
"The words 'serious reasons for considering' also, I believe, must be taken, as was contended by the respondent, to establish a lower standard of proof than the balance of probabilities."
[18]
More recently, the same court, in
Moreno and Sanchez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1994] 1 F.C. 298; 159 N.R. 210 (F.C.A.), reiterated this principle in these terms:
"It is universally accepted that the applicability of the exclusion clause does not depend on whether a claimant has been charged or convicted of the acts set out in the Convention. The Minister's burden is merely to meet the standard of proof embraced by the term 'serious reasons for considering'. In
Ramirez v. Canada
, [1992] 2 F.C. 306; 135 N.R. 390 (C.A.), this court canvassed this aspect of refugee law and concluded that the standard was one well below that required under either the criminal law ('beyond a reasonable doubt') or the civil law ('on a balance of probabilities' or 'preponderance of evidence')."
[19]
Similarly, this exclusion clause is applicable to a claimant who has never been criminally prosecuted for committing a crime against humanity, judging from this decision.
[20]
Secondly, the case law is unequivocal in holding that the respondent has the burden of demonstrating the existence of serious reasons, as stated in paragraph 1F(a) of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugee
.
"For all of these reasons, the Canadian approach requires that the burden of proof be on the Government, as well as being on a basis of less than the balance of probabilities."
[21]
Thirdly, this exclusion can be extended to a claimant who has not personally committed one or more of the crimes referred to in paragraph 1F(a) of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
.
[22]
In
Sivakumar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 163 N.R. 197 (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal stated (per Linden, J.A.):
"It is clear that if someone personally commits physical acts that amount to a war crime or a crime against humanity, that person is responsible. However, it is also possible to be liable for such crimes -- to 'commit' them -- as an accomplice, even though one has not personally done the acts amounting to the crime (see MacGuigan, J.A., in
Ramirez
, supra)."
[23]
Consequently, it is possible to apply the exclusion in paragraph 1F(a) of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
to a claimant if the latter has been an accomplice in a crime referred to in the said paragraph. However, how should the term "accomplice" be defined?
[24]
An initial definition is found in the
Ramirez
judgment, supra, in which MacGuigan, J.A., stated:
"From the premise that a mens rea interpretation is required, I find that the standard of 'some personal activity involving persecution', understood as implying a mental element or knowledge, is a useful specification of mens rea in this context. Clearly no one can 'commit' international crimes without personal and knowing participation.
"What degree of complicity, then, is required to be an accomplice or abettor? A first conclusion I come to is that mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offenses is not normally sufficient for exclusion from refugee status ... It seems apparent, however, that where an organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as a secret police activity, mere membership may by necessity involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts.
"Similarly, mere presence at the scene of an offence is not enough to qualify as personal and knowing participation (nor would it amount to liability under s. 21 of the Canadian
Criminal Code
), though, again, presence coupled with additional facts may well lead to a conclusion of such involvement. In my view, mere onlooking, such as occurs at public executions, where the onlookers are simply by-standers with no intrinsic connection with the persecuting group, can never amount to personal involvement, however humanly repugnant it might be. However, someone who is an associate of the principal offenders can never, in my view, be said to be a mere onlooker. Members of a participating group may be rightly considered to be personal and knowing participants, depending on the facts.
"At bottom, complicity rests in such cases, I believe, on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties in question may have of it. Such a principle reflects domestic law (e.g., s. 21(2) of the
Criminal Code
), and I believe is the best interpretation of international law."
[25]
In
Penate v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 71 F.T.R. 171 (T.D.), Madam Justice Reed summarized the applicable principles as follows:
"[2] An individual who has been complicit in (an accomplice to) an act which is physically committed by another is as responsible for the offence as the person who physically committed the act. Thus, if there are serious reasons for considering that an individual has been complicit in the commission of an international offence that individual will be excluded from obtaining refugee status by operation of art. 1(F).
"[3] In order to be complicit in the commission of an international offence the individual's participation must be personal and knowing. Complicity in an offence rests on a shared common purpose.
. . . . .
"[5] The
Ramirez
,
Moreno
, and
Sivakumar
cases all deal with the degree or type of participation which will constitute complicity. Those cases have established that mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient to bring one into the category of an accomplice. At the same time, if the organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as a secret police activity, mere membership may indeed meet the requirements of personal and knowing participation.
"[6] As I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them occurring (if he has the power to do so) nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself) but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. I note that the situation envisaged by this jurisprudence is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the commission of such offences is a continuous and regular part of the operation."
[26]
MacKay, J., recently established, in
Gutierrez et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 84 F.T.R. 227 (T.D.), the three criteria that a respondent must establish for the exclusion in paragraph 1F(a) of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
to be applicable in matters of complicity:
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
[27]
Some recent case law from the Federal Court of Appeal has held that the Refugee Division should not only allege the perpetration of crimes against humanity by the claimant but has a duty to identify the acts that are alleged against him.
"The importance of providing findings of fact as to specific crimes against humanity which the refugee claimant is alleged to have committed cannot be underestimated in a case such as this, where the Refugee Division has determined that the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Sri Lankan government ... Given the seriousness of the possible consequences of the denial of the appellant's claim on the basis of s. F(a) of art. 1 of the Convention to the appellant and the relatively low standard of proof required of the Minister, it is crucial that the Refugee Division set out in its reasons those crimes against humanity for which there are serious reasons to consider that a claimant has committed them. In failing to make the required findings of fact, I believe that the Refugee Division can be said to have made an error of law." (
Sivakumar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, supra)
[28]
However, the Federal Court of Appeal has added that absent such identification the decision should not be sent back to the Refugee Division for rehearing if
"... on the basis of the correct approach, no properly instructed tribunal could have come to a different conclusion." (
Ramirez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, supra)
[29]
Paragraph 1F(a) of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
provides that the Convention cannot apply to a claimant if there are serious reasons for considering that he has committed a crime against humanity. The concept of crime against humanity was defined by Linden, J.A., in
Sivakumar
, supra, as follows:
"Another question of law to be addressed in this appeal is what constitutes a crime against humanity. Article 6 of the
Charter of the International Military Tribunal
defines crimes against humanity as follows:
'(c) Crimes against humanity: namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian populations on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated.'
"There are certain additional legal requirements commonly accepted as part of the definition of crimes against humanity in the international sphere. Crimes against humanity must generally be committed in a widespread, systematic fashion (see, for example, the
Flick Trial
(Trial of Friedrich Flick and five others)
, United States Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals, Vol. IX, 1, and the
Justice Trial (the Trial of Joseph Alsotter and others
, United States Military Tribunal in Nuremberg, Law Reports of Trials of War Criminals, Vol. VI, 37, at p. 47)). As one Canadian commentator, Joseph Rikhof, supra, at p. 30 has noted:
'This requirement does not mean that a crime against humanity cannot be committed against one person, but in order to elevate a domestic crime such as murder or assault to the realm of international law an additional element will have to be found. This element is that the person who has been victimized is a member of a group which has been targeted systematically and in a widespread manner for one of the crimes mentioned.'
"Another historic requirement of a crime against humanity has been that it be committed against a country's own nationals. This is a feature that helped to distinguish a crime against humanity from a war crime in the past. (See the
Flick Trial
, supra, as well as the
Justice Trial
, supra). While I have some doubt about the continuing advisability of this requirement in the light of the changing conditions of international conflict, writers still voice the view that they 'are still generally accepted as essential thresholds to consider a crime worthy of attention by international law' (
Rikhof
, supra, at p. 31).
. . . . .
"... Finally, the International Law Commission has determined that individuals without connection to the state could indeed commit crimes against humanity (see
Rikhof
, supra, at p. 64). Based on these latter authorities, therefore, it can no longer be said that individuals without any connection to the state, especially those involved in paramilitary or armed revolutionary movements, can be immune from the reach of international criminal law. On the contrary, they are now governed by it."
[30]
Finally, the Federal Court of Appeal, in
Gonzalez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 170 N.R. 302 (F.C.A.), has reiterated the principle that it is unnecessary to analyze the validity of the applicant's fear of persecution if the exclusion under paragraph 1F(a) of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
applies.
"I find nothing in the
Act
that would permit the Refugee Division to weigh the severity of potential persecution against the gravity of the conduct which has led it to conclude that what was done was an art. 1F(a) crime. The exclusion of art. 1F(a) is, by statute, integral to the definition. Whatever merit there might otherwise be to the claim, if the exclusion applies, the claimant simply cannot be a Convention refugee."
[31]
Let us now apply these principles.
[32]
In the instant case, the Refugee Division cited the following evidence in support of its decision.
(a) From September 1987 to November 1989 the applicant worked within the administration of the Amal militia as a chief of radio transmission communications in the Tyre area.
(b) From November 1989 to April 1992 the applicant worked as a barricade monitor for the militia of the Forces Libanaises, always armed with a revolver.
(c) The documentary evidence discloses that these two militias (Amal and Forces Libanaises) were continually and regularly guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. [see footnote 1]
[33]
In this connection, Amnesty International, in its 1988 report, which is at pages 103 ff. of the D.T., refers to the atrocities committed by those militias on Lebanese territory.
(d) On three occasions the applicant personally arrested individuals to hand them over to the Forces Libanaises, knowing full well what might happen to them.
[34]
In this connection, at p. 306 of his D.T., here is how the applicant replied to the following question:
[Translation]"Q. But have you any idea of what was done with those people?
A. I had heard that they took them, that they investigated them and interrogated them. If they found that there was something on them, they were charged with something and they put them in prison or tortured them. That is what I meant."
(e) Consequently, the applicant was or, given his duties, should have been aware of the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the two above-mentioned militias.
(f) The record does not indicate that the applicant attempted to leave these two militias because of the war crimes and crimes against humanity they were committing.
[35]
Although the decision of the Refugee Division tribunal contains an error as to the date of the applicant's return to Lebanon, this error is not sufficient to vitiate a decision that is otherwise valid. In this case it fell to the tribunal, as the fact-finding body, to draw the conclusions it deemed appropriate from the evidence presented to it. In this case it was not unreasonably for the Refugee Division to find that there were "serious reasons for considering" that the applicant had been an accomplice in crimes against humanity in Lebanon.
[36]
Furthermore, I would like to add that, contrary to what the applicant appears to be arguing, the tribunal did not accuse him of having taken part in the events that occurred between October 1986 and February 1987. I am of the opinion, rather, that these events were cited by way of example, to demonstrate that the Amal and Forces Libanaises groups were committing crimes against humanity in Lebanon.
[37]
For these reasons, this application is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
