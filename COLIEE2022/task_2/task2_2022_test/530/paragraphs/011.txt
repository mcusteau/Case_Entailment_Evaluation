The Refugee Division determined that both applicants were not Convention refugees on the basis that s. F(a) of Article 1 [see footnote 2] of the 1951
United Nations Convention
applied to the principal applicant, upon whose claim his wife's claim was dependent. The Minister did not participate in the hearing and the tribunal considered the matter on the evidence presented to it. The tribunal did not make any express finding as to whether the principal applicant's claim to refugee status had merit, nor did it comment directly upon his credibility.
