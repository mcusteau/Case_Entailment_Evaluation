Turning to the dependent claim of the applicant's spouse, the Refugee Division noted that she had adopted her husband's evidence as her own in her PIF. It found:
"... There is nothing in the husband's narrative, however, that the wife faced any threat in Uruguay sufficiently serious as to be classified as persecution. The husband writes of four anonymous calls in the months prior to their leaving, 'in which my life was threatened'. A few lines later, he states '... I told my wife I could not continue living in fear'. In her oral testimony, the wife stated that these anonymous callers threatened her as well. We do not believe this, not only because she omits so significant a matter from her PIF but also because of the evasive and unsatisfactory way she testified on this matter. ... The wife's testimony was also not consistent as to when these four calls were received. At one point, she states that they started in 1989 and then contradicts herself at the end of her examination by saying that none of these four calls came in 1989."
