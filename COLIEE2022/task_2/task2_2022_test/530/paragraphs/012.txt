After reviewing the evidence from the principal claimant's PIF and oral testimony, the Refugee Division drew certain inferences, among them; that he was aware that the surveillance work he was involved in as a clerk at the ministry of Defence could lead to the persecution of the individuals concerned; that he was aware of acts of brutality by the police against individuals and he knew that the military regime wanted to have its brutality hidden, and that he helped in the transportation of what he believed was a corpse. Applying the principles set out by Mr. Justice MacGuigan in
Ramirez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 2 F.C. 306; 135 N.R. 390; 89 D.L.R.(4th) 173 (F.C.A.), the Refugee Division concluded:
"... A comment made by the Federal Court in
Ramirez
could well apply to the male claimant:
'He could never be classed as a simple on-looker, but was on all occasions a participating and knowing member of a military force, one of whose common objectives was the torture of prisoners to extract information ... he was an integral, albeit reluctant, part of the military enterprise that produced those terrible moments of collectively deliberate inhumanity.'
"He may not have been a willing participant and the knowledge of what he was involved in weighed on his mind. But he did not distance himself from it. We do not accept his argument that he could not distance himself from it. If he could desert the police in 1990, as he claims he did, he could have well deserted the forces at an earlier date. We have been given no reason why he did not do so. We, however, have been given a reason why he stayed on. His wife, in her testimony, stated:
'He was there because that was a means of, or a source of income, of a livelihood to him.'
"As there are serious reasons for considering that he committed a crime against humanity, by aiding and abetting those who tortured political prisoners, we determine that he falls under the ambit of Article 1(F)(a) and that accordingly, the Convention shall not apply to him."
