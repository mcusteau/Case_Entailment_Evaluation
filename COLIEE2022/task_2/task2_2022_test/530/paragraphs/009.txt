After that incident, the principal applicant did not have any problems with the authorities for some time but they began harassing him again in April 1989, after he signed a referendum against the Impunity Law, a law exonerating military personnel responsible for human rights violations. On April 17, the applicants' home was raided while they were away. The door had been forced open, furniture overturned, many household items were broken, all the electrical equipment and the applicant's revolver and uniform, had been taken. When they reported the incident to the police, the principal applicant was arrested for "neglecting to care for his firearm and uniform". On his last day in detention, the commissioner took him into his office to tell him that he was a useless officer, an enemy of the state and a subversive, and that his days were numbered since they knew that he had signed the referendum.
