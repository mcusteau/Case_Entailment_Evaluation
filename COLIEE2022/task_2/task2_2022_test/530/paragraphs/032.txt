Counsel for the applicants urged that similar to the circumstances in
Moreno
, supra, there was nothing that the principal applicant could have done to stop the commission of international offences. In my opinion, however, that case may be distinguished on its facts, in particular, the applicant in
Moreno
had deserted at his first opportunity after serving for only four months. The applicant in this case did not form the intention to desert the army until late 1989, though prior to that time, he had requested transfers and discharges. The penalty that he faced for desertion under police rules would have been imprisonment. Even after the change to a civil democratic government in April 1985, and the expiration of his early contract with the Ministry of Interior in October 1985, he did not request a discharge until 1989, though he was entitled to do so, in large part, he testified, because his faith that the problems would be resolved with democracy established in the country. Even after he decided in late 1989 to desert the police he continued to work for them until early in 1991.
