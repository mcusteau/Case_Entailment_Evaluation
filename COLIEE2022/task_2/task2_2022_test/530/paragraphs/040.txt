In my opinion, the reasons of the tribunal in this case demonstrate that the dependent claim was assessed on its own merits. The tribunal considered the totality of the evidence, including the wife's total reliance in her PIF on the narrative statement from her husband's claim, and found that there was "nothing in the husband's narrative ... that the wife faced any threat in Uruguay sufficiently serious as to be classified as persecution". Moreover, it did not find her evidence credible based on omissions from her PIF of significant facts, and "the evasive and unsatisfactory way she testified on this matter". It found her testimony contradictory. It concluded that she was under no threat of any kind and "has no good grounds to fear persecution in Uruguay".
