As Madame Justice Reed stated in
Penate
, supra, it is not necessary for the applicant to directly participate or witness the torture or murder of detainees so long as there was awareness or knowledge that international offences were being committed. Here the principal applicant's situation in terms of his physical presence at the scene of the persecutorial acts was akin to that of the applicant in
Penate
in that he knew that atrocities were being committed and he was not a mere bystander.
