He transferred to the police hospital in 1985 and became involved in union activities. After the union held a two day strike, the commissioner called him and three others to the police station regarding their participation in the union. Subsequently, at the beginning of June, that year, two officers came to his home and threatened him. Near the end of that month, while on his way home, he was pulled into a car inside of which there were three officers, including the two officers that he had driven to dispose of the body nearly a year before. After driving for about half an hour, the officers stopped the car at a desolated area, pulled the applicant out of the car, kicked him, taunted him, then pointed their guns at his head and pulled the trigger. He fainted. The guns were not loaded. When he awoke he walked to the road and got a ride home. A week later, he received an anonymous phone call threatening him that next time it would be for real.
