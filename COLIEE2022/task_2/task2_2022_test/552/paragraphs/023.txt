In support of this position, the respondent makes reference to the case of
Maassen et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.
, [2001] F.C.J. No. 961; 206 F.T.R. 13 (T.D.), where McKeown, J., held:
"[para. 14] [...] In my view, this is a finding of fact to which I should give some deference. The standard of review of Appeal Board decision is correctness with respect to issues of law such as interpretation of PSEA. See:
Boucher v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 86 (F.C.A.). However, findings of fact made by appeal boards are entitled to a higher degree of deference, except where such findings are made without regard to the evidence before the Appeal Board. See:
Canada (Attorney General) v. Rogerville
(1996), 117 F.T.R. 53 (T.D.)."
