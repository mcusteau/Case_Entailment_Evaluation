Section 21 of the
Act
provides for the right to appeal against appointments or proposed appointments in the Federal Public Service arising as a result of a closed competition. It is designed in part to ensure that unsuccessful candidates have the possibility to challenge whether the merit principle enshrined in subsection 10(1) of the
Act
is followed in respect of selections for appointment in the Federal Public Service.
