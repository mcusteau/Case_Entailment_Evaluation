[58]
The Appeal Board commented on the interchange of the words "and" and "or" as follows at paragraph 21 of page 17 of the decision:
"The appellant contended that the selection board ignored the words 'and' in the experience requirement and appeared to treat them as 'or'. Given the redundancies and generalities in the experience requirement phraseology, the distinctions that normally exist between 'and' and 'or' are rendered meaningless in this experience requirement."
