The applicant alleges that the Selection Board erred by improperly broadening the experience qualification and failing to communicate that change to potential candidates. In
Canada (Attorney General) v. Asselin
, [1999] F.C.J. No. 1572 (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal held:
"[para. 11] It appears, at first sight, that the power of review conferred by section 12.1, the parameters of which we described above, is a power that should be exercised by the Commission before a particular competition is completed. Counsel for the Commission emphasized to us that section 12.1 could be applied independently of the holding of a particular competition, since it allows a review of the qualifications established for 'any ... class of positions'. Even so, it still remains that in regard to a particular 'position', it is inconceivable that the power of review would be exercised during the competition to the detriment of candidates who have already entered or those who were excluded or failed to apply owing to some qualification that the Commission now wished to review.
Once it changes the ground rules along the way, the Commission should very definitely recommence the selection process or adjust it accordingly
