Appointments from within the Public Service must be based on selection according to merit. In
Bambrough v. Public Service Commission Appeal Board
, [1976] 2 F.C. 109; 12 N.R. 553 (F.C.A.) (hereinafter referred to as
Bambrough
), the Federal Court of Appeal held:
"[para. 10] The Public Service Commission has the statutory power and duty to appoint qualified persons to positions in the Public Service on the basis of merit. Selection according to merit is the dominant objective and consideration of the
Public Service Employment Act
and the essential criterion by which the exercise of powers under the
Act
is to be judged. Fairness may be regarded as an implied requirement of the
Act
in so far as it is necessarily related to selection according to merit, but appointments should not be set aside for alleged procedural irregularities when there is no reason to believe that the selection process has not been based on merit."
