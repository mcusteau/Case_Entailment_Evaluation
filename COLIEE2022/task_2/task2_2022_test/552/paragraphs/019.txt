In
Boucher et al. v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1557; 157 F.T.R. 79 (T.D.), McKeown, J., held:
"[para. 7] There were many submissions made with respect to the standard of review applicable in this case. In my view, the standard with respect to findings of fact is at the high end of the spectrum--that is, such findings should be accorded considerable deference by the reviewing court. Conversely, findings with respect to errors of law are at the lower end of the spectrum and are to be treated less deferentially."
