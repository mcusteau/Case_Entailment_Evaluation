It is well accepted that when an unsuccessful candidate exercises his or her right of appeal under section 21 of the
Act
, the central issue is not the protection of the appellant's rights, but rather the prevention of an appointment being made contrary to the merit principle. It is therefore the function of the Appeal Board to expose and correct errors in the application of standards and methods of assessment which have the effect of undermining the principle of selection according to merit.
