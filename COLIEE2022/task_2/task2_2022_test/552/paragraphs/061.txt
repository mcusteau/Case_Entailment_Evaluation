In its conclusion, the Appeal Board found that the Selection Board neither amended nor enlarged the experience requirement. In its view, the Selection Board did no more than reasonably interpret and apply the broad language of the Statement of Qualifications. At the top of page 9 of its decision, the Appeal Board stated:
"From this conclusion, it would naturally follow that the approach adopted by the selection board was not an enlargement of the experience requirement set out in the Statement of Qualifications. Rather, it was simply an interpretation of that requirement. Accordingly, this first allegation is dismissed."
