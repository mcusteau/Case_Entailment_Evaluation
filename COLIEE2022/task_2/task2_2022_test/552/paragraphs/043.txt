A Selection Board is the instrument used by the Public Service Commission to perform its duty to select candidates on the basis of merit. Its role is to assess the candidates and choose the ones they feel are most qualified for the position on the basis of merit. A Selection Board must, after examining and considering the applications of the candidates, consider such further material and conduct such examinations, tests, interviews and investigations as it considers necessary or desirable, select the candidates who are qualified for the position and place their names on an eligibility list in order of merit and this in accordance with sections 16 and 17 of the
Act
. A Selection Board does not have the authority to establish qualifications for a position nor to change them, it may however elaborate on the requirements suggested by the original qualifications as per Bambrough.
