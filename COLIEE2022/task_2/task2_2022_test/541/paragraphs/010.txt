[10]
The Board rejected the applicant's claim for refugee protection because she was found not to be credible, and because of the numerous contradictions, inconsistencies and implausibilities noted. It rendered its decision on the basis of the following evidence:
- The contradictory statements made at the port of entry in her Personal Information Form (PIF) and during the applicant's testimony concerning when the violent episodes allegedly began;
- The failure to mention, at the port of entry and in the PIF, the sexual assault of which she was allegedly a victim. The Board was of the opinion that the applicant's explanations for this omission were insufficient and contradictory;
- In her PIF, the applicant wrote that she had left the house on July 10, 2006, and had been confined only after that date. However, at the hearing before the RPD, she stated that she had been confined by her husband from July 3 to 19, 2006;
- The applicant allegedly gave an unsatisfactory explanation about the fact that she had been paid for the entire month of July even though she had not reported for work since July 2, 2006;
- In spite of the applicant's scars, which are consistent with her story of being slashed with a razor blade and burned with an iron, the Board concluded that, considering the applicant's total lack of credibility, her scars had not been caused in the alleged circumstances;
- The applicant contradicted herself with regard to her luggage and identity documents;
- There was no explanation as to why the applicant failed to bring along a copy of her marriage certificate and photographs of her wedding when she left Guinea;
- The applicant did not remember the number and names of the witnesses who were present at her wedding;
- The Board found the fact that the mayor had placed two seals on the marriage certificate (Exhibit P-3) to be implausible;
- Because the Board was unable to identify the applicant in the marriage photographs submitted in evidence, it attached no probative value to them.
