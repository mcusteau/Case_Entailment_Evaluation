In October 2005, the applicant's uncle announced that it was time she married. He told her that he had decided to give her hand in marriage to one of his friends, Kaba Sandou, a prosperous man 27 years her senior who already had two wives. Because this marriage entailed a financial benefit for her uncle, he threatened to disown the applicant if she refused to marry. As a result of the pressure from her family, the applicant finally consented to this marriage which she did not want, because she feared reprisals from her family if she refused.
