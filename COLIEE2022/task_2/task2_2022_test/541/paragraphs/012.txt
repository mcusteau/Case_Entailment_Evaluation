When issues of credibility and the assessment of evidence are involved, it is well established that the Court will intervene only if the decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it (
Federal
Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, paragraph 18.1(4)(
d
)). This high degree of deference to the administrative decision-maker is entirely warranted in this case, given the Board's expertise and the fact that it had the advantage of hearing the applicant.
