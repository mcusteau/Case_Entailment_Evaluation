When the applicant complained about mistreatment by her husband, her uncle said that she had to accept it and stop being stubborn. On July 3, 2006, Mr. Kaba allegedly cut her on the face with a razor blade. One week later, she went to the Hamdallaye police station in order to file a complaint of spousal abuse.
