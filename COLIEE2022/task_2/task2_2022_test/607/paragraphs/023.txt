With regard to the marriage certificate, this is what the Board concluded:
The claimant testified that the mayor, who had performed the civil wedding, had affixed the two seals found in Exhibit 3. The first reads [Translation] "Mayor, Commune of Matam," and the second, [Translation] "Chief Registrar of the Conakry Court of Appeal, Court of First Instance of Conakry," which is irreconcilable, since Mr. Toure, who signed the marriage certificate, identified himself simply as the mayor in the document.
