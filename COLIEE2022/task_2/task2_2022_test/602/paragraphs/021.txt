[21]
Accordingly, I have quashed the decision of the CRDD herein and ordered that this matter be referred back for rehearing and redetermination by the CRDD as it relates to the
sur place
elements of the claim, or a separate
sur place
claim itself. The rehearing and redetermination should be carried out by a differently constituted panel.
