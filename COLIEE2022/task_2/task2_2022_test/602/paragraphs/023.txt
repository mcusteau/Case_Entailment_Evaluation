[23]
Counsel before me took the position that the procedure for certification of a question in s. 83 of the
Immigration Act
is not applicable in this case. I make no comment on the position which they have taken. In any event, I am not satisfied that any aspect of this case poses a serious question of general importance that would warrant certification in accordance with the terms of that section.
Order accordingly.
