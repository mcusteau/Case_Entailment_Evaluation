The focus of the argument by counsel for the applicant on the third and fourth issues stated above was on the following paragraph taken from p. 6 of the CRDD's decision:
"In considering these points the panel reviewed the facts involved. Firstly, the claimant was one of three persons involved in the workplace protest. No evidence was introduced that the two others were harmed in any manner. Further, the claimant left the PRC on June 10, 1989, right after the crackdown on dissidents began. He was able to leave the PRC without any apparent difficulty and has had no direct involvement with the PSB."
