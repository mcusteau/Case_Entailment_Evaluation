[1] Gibson, J.
: This is an application that, by virtue to amendments of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, and other statutes that came into force on the 1st day of February 1993 and related Directions issued by the Chief Justice of the Federal Court, became an application for judicial review. The application is brought on behalf of a citizen of the People's Republic of China (China), who claims refugee status by reason of his political opinion and membership in a particular social group. The Convention Refugee Determination Division (the "CRDD") of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada found the Applicant not to be a Convention refugee within the meaning of the
Immigration Act
