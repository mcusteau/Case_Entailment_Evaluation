The use of "pattern" or "template" negative decisions was considered by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Komanov and Dimitrov v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 143 N.R. 233. At p. 234 of that decision, Hugessen, J.A., stated:
"We have looked carefully at the material submitted and can find in it nothing which would justify re-opening the court's earlier decision to refuse leave. The 'pattern' negative decision for Bulgarian claimants, while it is not, in our view, a course to be recommended for an administrative tribunal like the board, does not prejudge any issue and makes it quite clear that it should only be used as an aid once the members who have heard a particular case have made up their minds to reject the claim. It goes to form, not substance."
