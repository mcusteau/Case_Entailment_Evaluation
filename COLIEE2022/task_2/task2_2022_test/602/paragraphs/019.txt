Section 69.1(6) of the
Immigration Act
and rule 26 of the
Convention Refugee Determination Division Rules
, S.O.R./89 - 103, as they read at the relevant time, both deal with abandonment of claims but not in a way that is particularly relevant to the procedure by which evidence conceivably related to a
sur place
claim was introduced in this application and the failure on the part of the applicant and his counsel to address that evidence. Those provisions do, however, stand for the general principle that a claim should not be treated as abandoned without giving the applicant a reasonable opportunity to make representations. Here, the CRDD did not provide such an opportunity. It is true that neither the applicant nor his counsel chose to take advantage of the opportunity provided by their appearance before the CRDD. However, I am satisfied that should not be the end of the matter. The CRDD is under a positive obligation to act in a way that is fair to applicants appearing before it. I find that the CRDD, on the facts of this case, failed to fulfil that responsibility when it recognized the documentary evidence in question as representing a basis for a possible
sur place
claim but then determined to regard that claim as abandoned without first, either at the close of the hearing or at a later date, inviting the applicant in specific terms to make representations on that issue.
