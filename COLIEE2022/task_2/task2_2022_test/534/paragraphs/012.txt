In
Douglas v. Canada
, [1993] 1 F.C. 264; 58 F.T.R. 147 (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay discussed the role of the Court in pronouncing judgments upon the consent of the parties to the proceeding. He noted, at paragraph 18, that in private law litigation the Court does not have a duty to question a consent by the parties to a judgment, and so generally the Court does not look beyond the agreed-upon terms, provided the relief sought is within the scope of relief sought in the pleadings and might have been granted after the trial of the action.
