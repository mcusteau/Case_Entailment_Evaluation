Mr. Johnson's refugee hearing was scheduled for August 10, 2004. On that day, Mr. Johnson became ill and felt severe pains after working out in a gym with a friend. As a result of his condition, Mr. Johnson was taken to a Family Care clinic by the friend. He arrived at the clinic at approximately 9:15 a.m. and was seen by a doctor. After the examination, Mr. Johnson was prescribed medication and told that the medication would make him dizzy and sleepy. Mr. Johnson informed the doctor that he was scheduled to appear at an "Immigration Court" at 1:00 p.m. that day. The doctor advised that Mr. Johnson could not attend, and wrote a note explaining Mr. Johnson's condition and inability to attend the scheduled hearing.
