The fact that a tribunal has made a mistake does not by itself constitute a special reason for costs. While I find the decision of the RPD to have been perverse, that fact is insufficient to warrant granting costs to Mr. Johnson. In the present case, the Minister did not oppose the application for leave, consented to an extension of time Mr. Johnson required, and offered to consent to the decision being set aside on a timely basis after the tribunal record was delivered. In these circumstances, I find that Mr. Johnson has failed to establish the existence of special reasons that would justify an award of costs.
