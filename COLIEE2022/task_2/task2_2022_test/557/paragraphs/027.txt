Several problems arose from the manner in which the tribunal evaluated the documentary evidence regarding the applicant's ethnicity. The most striking one is the paucity of documents which were actually reviewed by the tribunal. Despite that the tribunal is not obliged to refer in its reasons to all of the evidence which was before it, "this principle does not apply to a failure to make reference to a case-specific document that is evidence directly relevant to the central issue addressed in the tribunal's decision." (see
Atwal v. Canada (Secretary of State)
(1994), 82 F.T.R. 73 (T.D.), at 75). This Court finds that the tribunal did not have regard to the totality of the evidence in the record upon reaching its conclusions.
