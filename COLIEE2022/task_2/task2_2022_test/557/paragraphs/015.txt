[15]
There are three problems with this passage. Firstly, the tribunal posits a theory that the applicant's conflict with the housing authorities started because of his mother's mental condition which caused her to become a danger to herself and to her neighbours. There was no evidence to support this conclusion, and as such, it is pure speculation by the tribunal. Secondly, the tribunal finds that the applicant's story is implausible when it states, without evidence, that it cannot believe that a neighbour would deliberately start a blaze wrongly to blame the applicant's mother. Finally, the tribunal wrongly blames the applicant for his predicament because, in its opinion, his complaints to the authorities regarding his mother's treatment were intemperate and defamatory, and set the stage for further conflict. Was the applicant expected to accept his fate meekly, and let a member of his family be taken away without a word? To blame the applicant here evinces a degree of callousness, and possible bias by the tribunal.
