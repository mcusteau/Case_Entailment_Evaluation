The tribunal wrongly put the applicant's personality on trial. For example, the tribunal noted that the applicant was overly assertive, bombastic, and that he shouted to emphasize points. How does being overly assertive permit the tribunal to draw a negative inference about credibility? In assessing his speaking style, the tribunal stated that the applicant was verbose, voluble, prolix and that the interpreter could not keep up with him. Again, how does the length of the applicant's answers permit the tribunal to state that the applicant was not credible? In assessing the manner in which he delivered his answers, the tribunal stated that the applicant's testimony was wooden, declamatory, rehearsed and unspontaneous. Although these epithets connote dishonesty, the tribunal directly contradicted itself when it observed that the applicant's testimony was rambling, off-centre, and evasive. How can the applicant be simultaneously wooden yet bombastic, or rehearsed yet rambling? The tribunal appears to have held the applicant's personality against him, forgetting that claimants from different cultural backgrounds may act and express themselves differently.
