The tribunal did not believe the applicant's explanation for his seven week delay in the United States. It states at page 16
"
The panel finds the claimant's explanation for his sojourn in United States not credible
. He alleged in his PIF that he went to United States, though always intending to go to Canada for asylum, solely because there is no Canadian Embassy in Sofia and he could not obtain a Canadian visitor visa there. In his oral testimony, by contrast, he said that he went United States because he had contacts in the construction field, who were able to secure an American visa for a fee of $2,500. His direct flight to the USA, terminating in Las Vegas, indicates that he already had employment arranged in United States to which he was destined.
If fearful of persecution, why then did he fail to apply for asylum in the United States? The claimant's response to this question was fuzzy and unclear.
He suggested that he placed more confidence in Canada's refugee system and in the level of social tolerance in Canada than he did in the USA. Those comments may be truthful in the narrow sense that they were made but, equally, they are not redolent of the behaviour of a person acting under a genuine and driving fear of persecution."
