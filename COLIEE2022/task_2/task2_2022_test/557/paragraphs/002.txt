. . . . .
SUMMARY OF THE CLAIMANT'S ALLEGATIONS
The claimant was born in Haskovo, Bulgaria, in 1948. He attended school for 11 years and trained to work as a machinist.
The claimant alleges he is of gypsy (Roma) ethnicity. While he was growing up, he experienced continuing discrimination and harassment by reason of his Roma origins. During his compulsory military service over the years 1967 to 1969, he alleged that all the dirty and difficult jobs were given to him and not to ethnic Bulgarians. The same problems confronted him in the area of employment where he felt that difficult, dirty, short-duration jobs were given to him and to other Romas in contrast to what was available for ethnic Bulgarians. For 20 years the claimant worked in construction and as a cleaner, experiencing constant layoffs and job relocations.
In the winter of 1989, he and his family were evicted from their housing in Sofia and literally turned out into the street. They spent the next several years living in a wooden shack and not until March 1993 was the family able to secure reasonable accommodation in a proper apartment building. However, from the moment they moved in, they faced resentment and hostility from their neighbours because of their Roma ethnicity. Less than a year after occupying their new apartment, they found themselves served with an eviction notice. The claimant and his family decided to resist the order. Neighbours set woodwork in the building on fire and accused the claimant's family (in particular, the claimant's mother) of responsibility. Then his mother was reported to the authorities as senile and forcibly removed to a mental hospital where she was poorly treated and became ill. The claimant wrote to health authorities protesting his mother's situation and in consequence, the police began persecuting him. He was denied access to his mother as she was dying. The claimant wrote a complaint to the Minister of Health. After that action, police came to the claimant's home, searched it and arrested him. He was kept in police custody for two nights. beaten, and made to tear up his complaint before he was released.
The claimant turned to a Roma political party for assistance but he found the party powerless to assist him. In the winter of 1994/95 the claimant hid out in the village of Turnovo while he was working in the same area. However, the police discovered his whereabouts and, while he was at work on a building site, seized him and forced him into a car destined for Sofia. En route, his abductors struck him repeatedly, saying they would 'knock some reason into his head.' On arrival in Sofia, he was taken before a prosecutor who asked him to sign a statement saying that he was voluntarily relinquishing his apartment. He was told that if he cooperated, another apartment would be found for him and his family. But if he resisted, he and his family would be forcibly evicted. The claimant said he would not sign the statement before having a chance to discuss the matter with his family. At this, the prosecutor became infuriated and started to strike the claimant. Then he took out an arrest warrant and served it on the claimant. The claimant was taken to the cell where he was told to 'think things over.' During the night, he was taken to another cell occupied by three other men. In the morning the three men were released but the claimant was kept inside. The prosecutor visited him to inquire whether he had 'changed his mind.' The prosecutor made numerous threats against the claimant and released the claimant after making him sign a blank summons mandating a court appearance in June or July 1995.
As the claimant was leaving the building where he had been held, 4 men jumped him and forced him into car. The claimant was driven to a site outside Sofia. He recognized three of the men as his former cellmates. They had in their possession the declaration, which the claimant had been earlier told to sign by the prosecutor. The claimant was held for three days and three nights, beaten and threatened. On the third night he managed to bribe the fourth man (then the sole guard) and escape.
The claimant immediately telephoned his wife who informed him that his construction work brigade was soon leaving for an assignment in Russia, in the city of Samara. The claimant arranged to go there as well, and on August 12, 1995, he traveled to Samara. However, police learned where he was and had his company return him to Bulgaria. Once back in Sofia, the police renewed their efforts to force the claimant and his family to vacate their apartment. To achieve this, the claimant was continually made to attend at the police station and other family members were subjected to constant harassment.
Just before Easter, in April 1996, police raided the claimant's apartment when he was temporarily absent. They searched everywhere, leaving his family in a state of shock. They then produced a 'protocol' for the search and compelled claimant's wife to sign it. They also advised the claimant's wife that if she wished to continue living, she would be well advised to leave the claimant.
Shortly after this episode, the claimant was arrested again and taken to the police station where he was told to sign a statement voluntarily giving up his apartment. He refused to comply. He was again sent to a cell where he was held overnight. The following day, renewed efforts were made to have him sign a statement but he refused to do so. He was finally released after a summons was issued for him and his family.
The claimant sought the assistance of a lawyer but initially could find no one who would take on his case because he was a gypsy. He also turned for assistance to a Roma Parliamentary Representative named Manush Romanov. After discussing his problems in detail with Mr. Romanov, the claimant concluded that while Mr. Romanov might be able to assist him in securing another apartment, he was impotent to redress the wrongs the claimant had already suffered and he could not resolve the claimant's larger fears and insecurities.
The claimant decided that he had to leave the country to safeguard his safety and security. He intended to go to Canada to seek asylum but there was no resident Canadian Embassy in Sofia and he felt it would be difficult to obtain a Canadian visa. He decided to go to the USA and he received an American visa in Sofia on August 7, 1996.
The claimant entered the USA and traveled to Las Vegas where he lived and worked until December 1996. He did not apply for asylum in the USA but instead, traveled north, with several other Bulgarian nationals, arriving at Douglas, B.C., and entering Canada on December 6, 1996. He claimed refugee status on arrival."
