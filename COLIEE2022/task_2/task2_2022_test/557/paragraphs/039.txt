The Supreme Court of Canada stated in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321, at 747 that it is appropriate when considering claims to refugee status based on any of the grounds set out in the definition also to consider the perspective of the persecutor, because that is the perspective which is determinative in inciting the persecution. In discussing the risk to the applicant based on his appearance, the tribunal stated at page 7:
"
The panel asked the claimant whether his physical appearance would enable other Bulgarians to conclude he was Roma were he to appear on a street in Sofia.
He said that other Bulgarians would know he was Roma because of his 'bright picturesque clothing' but he later acknowledged that if he wore regular clothing it would be difficult to say he was Roma." (emphasis added)
