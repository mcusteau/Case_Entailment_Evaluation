[36]
Of the many documents which were omitted from review is a letter from a former member of Parliament, Mr. Romanov. The letter refers to the applicant in terms of his being a Roma. What is particularly puzzling about this omission is that the tribunal specifically requested this letter at page 42 of the transcript, indicating that it has the most potential value of all of the documents. After specifically asking to see the document, the tribunal does not refer to it in its decision. This document, as well as others which were made available to the tribunal, appear to support the applicant's claim to Convention refugee status, and it was an error to omit it from its analysis without explanation.
