The tribunal determined at page 5 of the decision that the applicant's ethnicity, his credibility, and his failure to claim elsewhere were the pertinent issues in this claim. Although the tribunal analyzed each issue separately, its conclusion that the applicant was not credible permeated the entire analysis. For example, when discussing the applicant's ethnicity, the tribunal stated at page 6 that it "finds the history of persecution provided by the claimant not to be credible and thus it is difficult to approach his claimed ethnicity without substantial skepticism." When discussing the applicant's failure to claim for Convention refugee status in the United States, the tribunal stated at page 15 that "the panel finds the claimant's explanation for his sojourn in United States not credible", adding at page 16 that "when his delay in claiming is coupled to the other elements in his story that are also strongly wanting in credibility, a picture emerges of an opportunistic and untrustworthy witness."
