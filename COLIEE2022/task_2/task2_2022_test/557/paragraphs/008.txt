In
Leung v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 81 F.T.R. 303 (T.D.), Associate Chief Justice Jerome stated at page 307:
"[14] ... Nevertheless, the Board is under a very clear duty to justify its credibility findings with specific and clear reference to the evidence.
"[15] This duty becomes particularly important in cases such as this one where the Board has based its non-credibility finding on perceived 'implausibilities' in the claimants' stories rather than on internal inconsistencies and contradictions in their narratives or their demeanour while testifying.
Findings of implausibility are inherently subjective assessments which are largely dependant on the individual Board member's perceptions of what constitutes rational behaviour. The appropriateness of a particular finding can therefore only be assessed if the Board's decision clearly identifies all of the facts which form the basis for their conclusions. The Board will therefore err when it fails to refer to relevant evidence which could potentially refute their conclusions of implausibility
