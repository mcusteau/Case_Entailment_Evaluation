The tribunal adverts to the principle from
Maldonado v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1980] 2 F.C 302; 31 N.R. 34 (C.A.), at 305, that when a refugee claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness. But the tribunal does not apply the
Maldonado
principle to this applicant, and repeatedly disregards his testimony, holding that much of it appears to it to be implausible. Additionally, the tribunal often substitutes its own version of events without evidence to support its conclusions.
