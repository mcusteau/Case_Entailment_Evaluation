The tribunal questioned the applicant closely about his physical appearance, and observed that he had a fair complexion and blue eyes rather than the dark-eyed and dark-skinned appearance that is ascribed to the Roma. The tribunal stated the following at page 7 of the decision:
"The claimant was asked to react to the panel's observation that he was of fair complexion and had blue eyes.
It was further noted that in most other Roma claims which the panel had previously assessed from eastern European countries (other than Bulgaria), claimants had been dark-eyed and dark in colouring, clearly displaying the origins in the Indian subcontinent ascribed to them by linguists and cultural anthropologists.
As well information contained in Exhibit 2 states that 'Bulgarians have historically considered Gypsies to be 'dark-skinned people.'
The claimant said his eyes were actually green, that many Bulgarian Roma had green eyes, and that as a youth he had been darker; however, he also acknowledged that 'other Bulgarian Roma were dark.'
