The tribunal does not adequately explain why it omitted documents from review. One possible reason is discussed at page 1 of the decision where the tribunal states that it received post-hearing submissions from the applicant which appeared to display handwriting anomalies. After notifying counsel, the documents were forwarded for forensic analysis to the RCMP. The RCMP's findings were inconclusive. However, the tribunal does not explain how the RCMP's findings affected its decision, if at all.
