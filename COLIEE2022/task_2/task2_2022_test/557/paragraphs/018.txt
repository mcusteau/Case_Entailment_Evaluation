When discussing the applicant's credibility, the tribunal omits evidence which supports his claim. At page 13, the tribunal states that the applicant was asked to explain how his neighbours discovered that he and his family were Roma. The applicant answered that each apartment building contained a central registry where families were required to record their ethnic origins. Counsel for the applicant submitted to the tribunal an extract from the registry on September 24, 1998. The tribunal stated the following regarding this evidence:
"
The panel notes that there is no reference at all to the ethnicity of the claimant or his family members on the card in question, which was issued on April 26, 1993
, nor are the claimant's mother or his (then 22 year-old son) shown as residents, although the claimant testified that all were then part of his household. The panel finds the claimant's allegation that his neighbours discovered his Roma origins by means of the apartment registry not credible." (emphasis added)
