Once again, the tribunal engages in speculation: it admits that it has no precise information surrounding birth registration requirements in Bulgaria during the period in which the claimant was born, yet it nonetheless impugns the applicant's version of events. The tribunal continues at page 9:
"The panel was curious as to why the claimant would have applied to obtain a baptism certificate in 1985. At that point, the communist regime was still in place and any connections with the church were politically dangerous to exhibit.

This reply made absolutely no sense to the panel given the claimant's overarching allegation that all his problems flowed from his Roma ethnicity.
