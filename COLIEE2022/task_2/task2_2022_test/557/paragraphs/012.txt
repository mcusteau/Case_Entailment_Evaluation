And at page 12, regarding the repeated searches of the applicant's home, the tribunal continues:
"... This makes no sense at all.
Nor does the alleged house raid over Easter 1996 in order to seize copies of letters which had already been sent to the various ministers and departments in the Bulgarian government. After all, the claimant was not in possession of any classified or private information, nor was he privy to secrets, which if made public, would constitute embarrassing revelations for the State. The only papers he possessed consisted of copies of his own correspondence.
When he was asked why the Bulgarian authorities would go to such lengths to create an appearance of legality around efforts to evict him, he said that if they did not proceed cautiously in their eviction, they might find themselves 'facing a Roma revolt.' He added that he was in touch with a Roma MP named Manush Romanov and had taken steps to retain a lawyer. These comments, implying as they do that the Bulgarian government was nervous about antagonizing the Roma community are completely at odds with a multitude of other statements made by the claimant indicating the Bulgarian state was completely indifferent to the situation of the Roma community and cared not a fig for its general welfare. As well the observation, if ingested at face value, borders on the inherently absurd - if the Bulgarian State wished to appear scrupulously 'legal' about an eviction order for fear of Roma anger, why would the same state abduct and brutalize the claimant and his family? Does a 'legal' eviction make for better political 'optics' than kidnapping, terror, and physical brutality?" (emphasis added)
