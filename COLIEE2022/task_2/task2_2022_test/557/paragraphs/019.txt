The tribunal erred when it stated that there is no reference to the ethnicity of the claimant or of his family on the card. In fact, the address card clearly indicates the words "Roma Family" in the top left hand corner (see page 173 of the Tribunal Record). Given the importance of the applicant's ethnicity in the eyes of the tribunal, this is a serious omission.
