As for the third point, counsel for the applicant submits that the Board viewed pictures of the victims' body parts "which beside being irrelevant at this hearing are also illegal evidence, because of their impact". I do not agree. In my view, this evidence is not inadmissible in a court of law, nor before an administrative tribunal. Moreover, the pictures, here, were made available to the inmate before the hearing of January 6, 1989. In R. v. Wray, [1971] S.C.R. 272, Mr. Justice Martland of the Supreme Court of Canada stated, at page 293:
"... the exercise of a discretion by the trial judge arises only if the admission of the evidence would operate unfairly. The allowance of admissible evidence relevant to the issue before the court and of substantial probative value may operate unfortunately for the accused, but not unfairly. It is only the allowance of evidence gravely prejudicial to the accused, the admissiblity of which is tenuous, and whose probative force in relation to the main issue before the court is trifling, which can be said to operate unfairly."
