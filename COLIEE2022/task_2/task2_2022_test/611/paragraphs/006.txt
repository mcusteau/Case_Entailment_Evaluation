Subsequently, pursuant to s. 21.4 of the Parole Act, the Parole Board reviewed the case of the applicant referred to it by the Service pursuant to s. 21.3(2). Pursuant to s. 21.4(4) (a), the Board decided that the applicant should be detained until the completion of his full sentence. Section 21.4 of the Act states:
"21.4(1) The Board shall, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the regulations, review the case of every inmate referred to it by the Service pursuant to subs. 21.3(2) or referred to the Chairman of the Board pursuant to subs. 21.3(3).
"(2) Notwithstanding s. 17, in reviewing a case pursuant to subs. (1), the Board shall
(a) cause to be conducted all such inquiries in connection therewith as it considers necessary; and
(b) subject to s. 21.3(6) and (7), hold a hearing at the time and in the manner prescribed by the regulations.
"(3) Where the case of an inmate is referred to the Chairman of the Board during the six months immediately preceding the presumptive release date of the inmate, the inmate is not entitled to be released from imprisonment prior to the rendering of the decision of the Board in connection therewith.
"(4) On completion of the hearing and review of the case of an inmate pursuant to this section, where the Board is satisfied that the inmate is likely to commit, prior to the expiration according to law of the sentence the inmate is then serving, an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person, the Board may, by order,
(a) direct that the inmate shall not be released from imprisonment prior to the expiration according to law of the sentence the inmate is serving at the time the order is made, or
(b) impose, subject to subs. (6), as one of the conditions of the release subject to mandatory supervision of the inmate, residence in a community-based residential facility,
and, where the Board is not so satisfied, the Board shall make an order declaring whether, at the time the case was referred to the Board, the inmate was serving a term of imprisonment that included a sentence imposed in respect of an offence mentioned in the schedule that had been prosecuted by indictment and whether, in its opinion, the commission of the offence caused the death of or serious harm to another person.
"(5) For the purpose of determining the order to be made in respect of an inmate pursuant to subs. (4), the Board shall take into consideration any factor that is relevant to the case of the inmate and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(a) a pattern of persistent violent behaviour established on the basis of any evidence and, in particular,
(i) the number of offences committed by the inmate causing physical or psychological harm,
(ii) the seriousness of the offence for which the sentence imposed is then being served,
(iii) reliable information demonstrating that the inmate has had difficulties controlling violent impulses to the point of endangering the safety of any other person,
(iv) the use of weapons in the commission of any offence by the inmate,
(v) explicit threats of violence,
(vi) behaviour of a brutal nature associated with the commission of any offence by the inmate, and
(vii) a substantial degree of indifference on the part of the inmate as to the reasonably foreseeable consequences, to other persons, of the behaviour of the inmate;
(b) psychiatric or psychological evidence that the physical or mental illness or disorder of the inmate is of such a nature that the inmate is likely to commit, prior to the expiration according to law of the sentence the inmate is then serving, an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person;
(c) reliable information the existence of which compels reaching the conclusion that the inmate is planning to commit, prior to the expiration according to law of the sentence the inmate is then serving, an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person; and
(d) the availability of supervision programs that would offer adequate protection to the public from the risk the inmate might otherwise present until the expiration according to law of the sentence the inmate is then serving.
"(6) The Commissioner or a person designated by the Commissioner must consent, in writing, to the residence in a penitentiary of an inmate in respect of whom an order is made pursuant to paragraph (4)(b).
"(7) The Board shall, after completing its review of the case of an inmate pursuant to this section, cause to be given to the inmate a copy of its decision and, where applicable, a copy of any order made pursuant to paragraph (4)(a) or (b) and of any other conditions imposed on the inmate, together with the reasons for the decision of the Board,
(a) where the case was referred to the Board not later than six months before the presumptive release date of the inmate, at least two months before the presumptive release date; or
(b) where the case was referred to the Board during the six months immediately preceding the presumptive release date of the inmate, as soon as possible after the completion of the review.
"(8) An inmate who is in custody pursuant to an order made under paragraph (4)(a) is not eligible for parole."
