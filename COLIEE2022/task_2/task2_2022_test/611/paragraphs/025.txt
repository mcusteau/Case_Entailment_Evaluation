I must therefore conclude that the National Parole Board, in this case, acted fairly, in good faith, without bias and in a judicial temper, having also given the applicant the opportunity to adquately state his case. I consider also that the applicant has totally failed to establish that any of his rights or freedoms as guaranteed by the Charter have been infringed or denied. Consequently, the discretion as exercised by the Board in directing that the applicant not be released from imprisonment prior to the expiration of his full sentence of imprisonment ought not to be interfered with by this court, and an order is rendered dismissing the application with costs against the applicant.
Application dismissed.
