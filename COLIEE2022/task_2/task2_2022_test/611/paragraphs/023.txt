In my view, this broad allegation is totally unsubstantiated and is certainly not supported by any relevant complaints made prior to the original Board's decision against the applicant. In the transcript of the hearing before the Board, the applicant does not indicate anywhere that he did not understand what was being said to him. As a matter of fact, the transcript rather shows an intelligible discussion and ventilation of issues between members of the Board and the applicant. Indeed, there is no indication that the applicant ever mentioned before the original board that he was not understood during the hearing and/or that he did not understand what was said at that time.
