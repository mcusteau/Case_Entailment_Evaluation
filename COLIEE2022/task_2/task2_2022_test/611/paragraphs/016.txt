When Correctional Services assessed the applicant inmate pursuant to s. 21.3 of the Parole Act, it recommended that he be detained in custody until the expiration of his sentence. The applicant was informed of the reasons why the Services was of this view and all the information that it had was given to the applicant, except for certain information on the victim children and others who had significant relationships with the applicant prior to his charges. The latter information, alleged by the respondents to be merely confirmatory of what had already been indicated in the Progress Summary (exhibit S-4 filed in support of the affidavit of Pierette Soucy, criminologist, sworn on August 28, 1989) and previous reports, was considered confidential. It is information which, under s. 17(5) of the Parole Regulations, should not be disclosed on grounds of public interest because its disclosure:
- could reasonably be expected to threaten the safety of the informants (s. 17(5)(a)); and
- could reasonably be expected to be injurious to the conduct of lawful investigations or the conduct of reviews pursuant to the act of suspension, including any such information that would reveal a source of information obtained in confidence (s. 17(5)(e)).
