Not only did the panel note discrepancies in terms of the dates of events alleged to have taken place by the applicant, but it was particularly concerned by the fact that the applicant provided two distinct grounds for refugee protection, one in the POE notes and the other in the PIF. As noted by the panel:
Respecting the inconsistencies, the panel finds that the claimant’s PIF narrative emphasizes the extortion attempt by the LTTE as the reason for making his refugee claim. However, a reading of the immigration interview, in the panel’s view, probably conveys the impression that the basis of the claim was because the police harassed the claimant on an ongoing basis because he lived in a Sinhalese neighbourhood in Colombo and the neighbours complained about the claimant’s Tamil visitors.
