In the past year, the fairness of reverse onus questioning and the possible fettering of discretion stemming from Guideline 7 were litigated before the Federal Court on a number of occasions, most notably in the cases of Thamotharem v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2006] F.C.J. No. 8, and of Benitez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2006] F.C.J. No. 631, which gave rise to contradictory jurisprudence. In Thamotharen, Chief Justice Edmond P. Blanchard concluded that Guideline 7 unlawfully fetters the discretion of Board members in determining whether or not to proceed with reverse order questioning. In Benitez however, Justice Richard Mosley concluded that the directives in Guideline 7 were not mandatory, and thus the Board members were not bound by them. As such, there was no evidence that Guideline 7 fettered Board membersâ€™ discretion to determine the proper procedures to follow in a refugee hearing. The decision in Thamotharen is being appealed before the Federal Court of Appeal.
