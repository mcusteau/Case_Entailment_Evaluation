Justice Tremblay-Lamer also relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Mahanandan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 1228, at paragraph 8:
Where, as here, documentary evidence of the kind in issue here is received in evidence at a hearing which could conceivably affect the Board's appreciation of an Appellant's claim to be a Convention refugee, it seems to us that the Board is required to go beyond a bare acknowledgement of its having been received and to indicate, in its reasons, the impact, if any, that such evidence had upon the Applicant's claim. As I have already said, the Board failed to do so in this case. This, in our view was a fatal omission, as a result of which the decision cannot stand.
