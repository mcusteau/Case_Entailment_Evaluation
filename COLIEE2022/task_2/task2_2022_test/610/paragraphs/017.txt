This conclusion was supported by Justice Mosley who, like Chief Justice Blanchard, engaged in a detailed analysis of the factors identified in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, to determine the content of the duty of fairness. At paragraphs 127 and 128 of Benitez, Justice Mosley wrote:
I have no difficulty, after considering the Baker factors and the further factors submitted by the applicants, in deciding that it has not been established that natural justice requires that counsel for a refugee claimant be provided with the opportunity to question the claimant first in order for the claimant to have a meaningful opportunity to present his or her case fully and fairly, or that the Guideline results in denial of the effective assistance of counsel.
I agree with the conclusion reached by Justice Blanchard that the opportunity for the applicant to make written submissions and provide evidence to the Board, to have an oral hearing with the participation of counsel, and to make oral submissions, satisfies the requirements of the participatory rights required by the duty of fairness and that Guideline 7 does not, in itself, breach that duty.
