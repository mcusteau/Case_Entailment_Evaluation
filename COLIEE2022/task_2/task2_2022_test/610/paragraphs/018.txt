I am in agreement with the recent jurisprudence from this Court to the effect that reverse order questioning in itself does not violate a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness. As the objection by the applicant’s counsel did not disclose personal circumstances that would demonstrate to the Board that a fair hearing required that the applicant be allowed to lead evidence, I find that the Board did not violate the applicant’s right to procedural fairness in rejecting the request to vary the order of questioning.
Whether the panel’s finding on the credibility of the applicant was patently unreasonable.
