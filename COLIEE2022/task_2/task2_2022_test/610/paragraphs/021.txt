[21]
In the case before us, the panel stated the following with respect to information provided in the POE notes and in the PIF:
It is true that the claimant’s story is narrated in his PIF and that he is only required to give a brief account of his reasons for claiming refugee protection during his interview by an Immigration Officer. However, it is reasonable to expect consistency between the statements in the PIF narrative and the port-of-entry. However, the panel finds that there are several significant inconsistencies in the claimant’s story between the PIF narrative and the interview notes at the port-of-entry (POE). As well, in this particular claim, the panel finds that there was a major omission in the port-of-entry statement, which the panel finds reasonable to expect that the claimant would probably mention during his immigration interview.
