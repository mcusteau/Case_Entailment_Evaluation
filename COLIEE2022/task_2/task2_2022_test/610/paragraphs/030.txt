Justice Paul Rouleau in Ndlovu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1091 at paragraph 9, followed Justice Yvon Pinard in his reasons:
… The conclusions regarding the applicant’s credibility were unmistakably set out by the Board in its reasons, following a detailed analysis of the inconsistencies in the testimony and PIFs of all three applicants. Having determined that the applicants lacked credibility regarding their actual experiences of persecution, the Board was not required to further assess other evidence. This is supported by Justice Pinard’s statement from Djouadou v. Canada (MCI), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1568 at para. 4:
With respect to the applicant’s argument that the panel did not consider the documentary evidence concerning Algeria, I am of the view that insofar as the applicant’s testimony was found not to be credible, such an assessment was not required (Sheikh v. Canada (M.E.I.), [1990] 3 F.C. 238).
