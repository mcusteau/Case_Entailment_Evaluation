On the other hand, there is also jurisprudence to the effect that when the Board determines that an applicant lacks credibility with respect to their alleged experiences of persecution, it may not be required to further assess other evidence.

With respect to the applicant's argument that the panel did not consider the documentary evidence concerning Algeria, I am of the view that insofar as the applicant's testimony was found not to be credible, such an assessment was not required (Sheikh v. Canada (M.E.I.), [1990] 3 F.C. 238).
