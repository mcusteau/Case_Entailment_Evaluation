That being said, there is much jurisprudence to support the notion that in assessing a claim of a well-founded fear of persecution, the Board is required to proceed with an assessment of the documentary evidence, even when there is a negative finding of credibility with regards to the applicant’s alleged experience of persecution. The most frequently quoted passage comes from a decision of Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer in Seevaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 694, at paragraphs 11 and 13:
In my opinion, the Board failed to consider all of the evidence before it and simply denied the Applicant's claim because it did not find her credible. In the circumstances of this case, there was still evidence remaining which could have affected the assessment of the claim. Therefore, this evidence should have been expressly assessed.
[…] The Board […] did not address documentary evidence emanating from sources other than the Applicant's testimony, which confirms the risks facing young Tamil women in Sri Lanka. On these facts, the Board's conclusion that there was "no credible or trustworthy evidence" before it cannot stand.
