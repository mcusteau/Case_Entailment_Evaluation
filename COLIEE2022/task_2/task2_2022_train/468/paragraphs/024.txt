In certain cases, the right to counsel can be likened to the right to be heard. Again in
Glen Howard
, supra, Thurlow, J.A., writes:
"In this context, any right a person may have to the assistance of counsel arises from the requirement to afford the person an opportunity to adequately present his case. This particular point was observed by Goodridge, J., in
In re Prisons Act
and
In re Pollard et al.
[Supreme Court of Newfoundland, February 20, 1980, unreported.] when he noted in parenthesis: 'Jeopardy, of course, is not the full test, in a broader sense one is really talking about a person having the right to be heard by a tribunal.'"
