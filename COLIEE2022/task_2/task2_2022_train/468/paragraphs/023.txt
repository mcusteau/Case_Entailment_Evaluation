Howard v. Stony Mountain Institution Inmate Disciplinary Court
, [1984] 2 F.C. 642; 57 N.R. 280 (F.C.A.), is a prison law case cited in many immigration decisions. In that case, Thurlow, J.A., sets out the elements which must be considered in determining if the absence of counsel gives rise to procedural unfairness:
"... it appears to me that whether or not the person has a right to representation by counsel will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, its nature, its gravity, its complexity, the capacity of the inmate himself to understand the case and present his defence. The list is not exhaustive. And from this, it seems to me, it follows that whether or not an inmate's request for representation by counsel can lawfully be refused is not properly referred to as a matter of discretion but is a matter of right where the circumstances are such that the opportunity to present the case adequately calls for representation by counsel."
