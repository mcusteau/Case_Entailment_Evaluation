In the 1997 decision allowing the applicant a stay, the Appeal Division made the following points:
(a) Since his arrest in 1993, the applicant has not had any run-ins with the law. While the offence charged was serious, many factors explain it, if not excuse it. The applicant is of limited intellect, limited personal resources to find himself gainful employment. At the time of the drug trafficking, he ran a pawn shop, where associating with the wrong crowd led him down a path of crime. He is by nature very easily influenced.
(b) His family is of great help to him. They visit him at the penitentiary where he is being detained. He is making great efforts to improve his situation, taking all the courses possible to increase his chances of finding a job and function better in society. His behaviour as an inmate has been exemplary.
(c) He is the father of two children (in 1997; now three in 2004), for whom he shows a great deal of affection.
(d) The Appeal Division concludes with these words before ordering the stay:
"He is not violent and poses no danger to the safety of the public. His family values are high on his priorities. His family members are educated people, and he has their strong support and understanding. He no longer has any family in his country of origin.
"It is true that strict monitoring in a prison environment is conducive to such a change in behaviour for an influenceable person like the appellant and that, as a result, his return to society will not be without serious risk. To date, he remains influenceable and vulnerable. His change of course and his desire to pursue that change were expressed sincerely."
