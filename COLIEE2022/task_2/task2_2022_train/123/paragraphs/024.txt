  Counsel suggested the Board down-played the significance of the police searches and the stress caused by characterizing these as "from time-to-time". This is hardly true given the portion of the decision quoted above and, at p. 4 of their decision, they wrote: "the claimant was subjected to  
 several searches 
  by the police" (emphasis added). There is no merit in the claimant's contention here. Searches which take place only twice a year can certainly be characterized as occurring "from time-to-time", and in any event, the Board has full authority to attach such weight to and interpret the evidence presented to it.
