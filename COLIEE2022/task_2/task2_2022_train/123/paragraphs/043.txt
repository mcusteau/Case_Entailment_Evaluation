 [43] 
  For the above reasons I will send this matter back to the Board to be determined in the following manner: 
 
 
 
 1. Does all of the applicant's circumstantial evidence, including that relating to the fatal accident involving her car and the subsequent police investigation, establish that the local police were involved in the attacks upon her and her son? 
 
 
 
 2. Does all of the applicant's circumstantial evidence, including that relating to the fatal accident involving her car and the subsequent police investigation, establish that the local police are still actively seeking out the applicant and her son? 
 
 
 
 3. If the local police were involved in the attacks upon the applicant and her son and they were involved in the accident does this establish a pattern of past persecution? 
 
 
 
 4. If there is a pattern of past persecution and the police are still seeking the applicant and her son is this enough to establish a serious possibility of future persecution at the hands of the local police? 
 
 
 
 5. If there is a serious possibility of future persecution from the local police can the applicant establish that the State is unwilling or unable to protect her and her son?
