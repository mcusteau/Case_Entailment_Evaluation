  The applicant, Adelina Ivanova Hristova, and her minor son are citizens of Bulgaria. The applicant's son's claim is based upon the applicant's claim. They fled Bulgaria and arrived in Canada in November 1990. The applicant claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution based upon her political opinion and her membership in a particular social group (i.e., being married to her husband).
