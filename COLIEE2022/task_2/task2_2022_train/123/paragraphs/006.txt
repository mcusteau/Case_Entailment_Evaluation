  In February 1990, again under false pretences, the applicant was summoned to the police station and interrogated about her husband's whereabouts. This time the applicant told the police her husband had fled to Canada. In response to this the police ordered the applicant to write her husband and tell him it was safe to come home. She refused. In response to her refusal the police warned the applicant that an "accident" might happen to her or her son which would force her husband to return.
