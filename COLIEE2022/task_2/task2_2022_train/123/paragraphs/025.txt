  Most disturbing, however, is the fact that the Board's found, even with all the material before it, that police were not involved in the attacks on the applicants and were not still seeking the applicants. The Board has indicated it accepted most of the claimant's evidence, found her credible and believed the stress of the police searches caused a miscarriage. The "police" may have been rogue police trying to protect themselves from any statements that could be made by her husband, or they might have had the complicity of the state, or at the very least no intervention by the state. The Board itself commented at p. 5 of its reasons: 
 
 
 
 "Particularly abhorrent were the attempts of police to coerce the claimant to write to her husband to reassure him that no harm would come to him if he returned to the country but threatened her with the possibility of an accident. 
 
 
 
 "Clearly the vestiges of the old regime and the malpractice of the past will not be eradicated overnight; old habits die hard."
