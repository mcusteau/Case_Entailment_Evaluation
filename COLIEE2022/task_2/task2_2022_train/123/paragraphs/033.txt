  Second, the applicant claimed to have a well-founded fear of persecution based upon political opinion. Basically, she was arguing that she feared persecution based upon her husband's political activities. It is clear that a person could make a claim to fear persecution because of the political beliefs of his or her spouse. What is important is not whether that person has those beliefs but rather whether the persecutors believe the person to hold those beliefs (See:  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321, at 747 (S.C.R.)). Certainly, it is not implausible to find that authorities may suspect spouses of sharing the same political views. The problems for the applicant, however, is that there has been nothing presented that would give any indication that the applicant's husband was sought by the police for political purposes (i.e., because of his political opinion). At the most, it looks like the police were after the husband because he was going to expose the fact that they had shot two ethnic Turks (supposedly without reason). This is a private, as opposed to political-public dispute, between the husband and the police. There is no evidence of any politicism that is required in order for the treatment to be linked to the Convention. Indeed, the bulk of the applicant's argument is based on the fact that she and her son were targeted merely as devices for achieving the capture of the husband rather than for any perceived political opinions. Therefore, there is no link between the treatment of the applicant and her son and any political opinion, hence, no link to any Convention reason.
