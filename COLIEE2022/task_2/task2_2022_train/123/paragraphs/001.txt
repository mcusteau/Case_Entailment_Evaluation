 Cullen, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review, pursuant to Direction No. 17 of the Chief Justice, of the decision of the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (hereinafter the "Board"), dated December 16, 1991, wherein the applicants were held not to be Convention refugees. Leave to appeal was originally granted by Linden, J.A., on April 2, 1992. Since this is a case which was originally to be heard by the Court of Appeal the applicants have an automatic right to appeal and therefore no "question for certification" is required.
