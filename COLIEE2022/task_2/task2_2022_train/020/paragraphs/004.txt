  The issue is whether the Applicants fall within the exception to the statutory stay provisions set out at paragraph 49(1.1)(a) of the  
 Act 
 --namely, whether they sojourned in the United States. The Applicants submit that the ten days they spent in the United States do not constitute sojourning, but merely passing through the United States in order to come to Canada. They swear in their affidavits that their travel agent in Russia had suggested that they buy a seven-day tour package to Miami in order to secure an American visa and that they went to Miami only because they were afraid to leave the airport upon arriving in New York. They felt that if they did not use their prepaid tickets to Miami, the airport authorities would become suspicious, send them back to Russia or put them in jail.
