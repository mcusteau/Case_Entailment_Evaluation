These distinctions make sense if the context of the provision is taken into account. The stated words in the NOC are "a bachelor degree in translation or a related discipline" and are found in an NOC item which covers translators, interpreters and terminologists which have different duties attached to them. Requiring a bachelor's degree in a related discipline was intended to provide flexibility in the assessment of the employment requirements enabling the visa officer a degree of latitude in order to take into account a person whose intended occupation was that of an interpreter or terminologist.
