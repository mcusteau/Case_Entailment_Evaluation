The visa officer reviewed the transcript of the university undergraduate and graduate courses the applicant took which included intensive English reading, extensive English grammar, writing, listening and speaking as well as British and American literature, world history and social science courses. The visa officer noted:
"Among these courses, PI took
translation
and
linguistics
. Her
graduate
studies
indicated courses in lexicology, American culture, international relations, American history, Western civilization and American literature.
No translation or interpretation courses noted in this transcript
.
With only two courses related to translation and interpretation, PI's education cannot be viewed as the equivalent or substitute for the specific employment requirements for interpreters/translators which are abundantly clear in the NOC.
