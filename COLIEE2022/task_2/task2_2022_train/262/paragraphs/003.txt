The NOC 2148 description of the job duties of a marine engineer is much briefer. It describes that occupation as involving the design and development of vessels, equipment and systems, as well as the building repair and maintenance of vessels and systems:
"Marine and navel engineers design and develop marine vessels and floating structures, and associated marine power plants, propulsion systems and related systems and equipment and oversee the building, maintenance and repair of vessels and marine systems."
