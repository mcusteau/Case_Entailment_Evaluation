In any event, even if the visa officer's conduct was an acceptance of extrinsic evidence, it is inconsequential in this case. Many words have several meanings. The English word "engineer", for example, is one. The title of the applicant's job, when translated from Russian to English, is not the most significant of considerations. It is the duties he performed in that job that govern, not the title it carries. The visa officer makes it clear that it was the applicant's job duties that she relied upon for her conclusion, not the applicant's job title. The visa officer did not err in concluding that those duties did not correspond to the NOC descriptions of a marine or mechanical engineer.
