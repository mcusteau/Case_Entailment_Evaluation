Counsel for the applicant refers to the visa officer's handwritten notes, which are cryptic indeed, and to the fact that the applicant was assessed as having had the educational qualifications to work as a mechanical or marine engineer. Counsel refers to the fact that the applicant's educational qualifications entitled him to engage in an occupation much more demanding than that of mechanic described in the NOC. Counsel states that these factors mean that the applicant's application falls into the "grey area" and that this required the visa officer to express more explicitly to the applicant her concerns about his lack of job experience, so that he could answer those concerns.
