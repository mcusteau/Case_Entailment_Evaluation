The
Issaeva
and
Birioulin
cases speak to a situation in which an assessment, had it been completed, might have led to a conclusion that the applicant could be awarded enough points to be granted landing. That was not the situation in this case with the assessment of the applicant by reference to the occupational categories of mechanical engineer and marine engineer. The present situation is similar to those in
Ou v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 452; 39 Imm. L.R.(2d) 227 (T.D.), and
Cai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 31 (T.D.). Also, in assessing the applicant under the category marine engineer officer (NOC 2274), and mechanic (marine) (NOC 7311), the visa officer was only undertaking the duty this court has said visa officers must perform, that is, assessing the applicant in alternate occupational categories to those he specifically identified, categories that might lead to a more favourable result for him; see, for example,
Gaffney v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 121 N.R. 256; 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 185 (F.C.A.).
