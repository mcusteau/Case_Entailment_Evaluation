The visa officer stated in the refusal letter, which she sent to the applicant, that he did not meet the minimum entry requirements for the occupation of mechanical engineer. She made no reference to any assessment under the occupation marine engineer. She stated in the refusal letter that she had assessed the applicant as a marine-engineer officer (NOC 2274) because she stated in the letter that this was the most beneficial category for him. (Actually NOC 7311 appears to be more beneficial but the parties have treated that as irrelevant to this application). Counsel for the applicant argues that the visa officer erred because she did not assess the applicant as a marine engineer and because she assessed the applicant in an occupational category in which he did not seek to be assessed. He had told the visa officer that he was not a ship's officer.
