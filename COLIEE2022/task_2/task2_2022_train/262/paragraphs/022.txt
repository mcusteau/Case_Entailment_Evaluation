Counsel for the applicant argues that the visa officer ignored information, specifically the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers assessment, and the employer's letter of reference. While neither of these documents are mentioned expressly in the CAIPs notes, I cannot conclude that they were ignored. In the affidavit prepared for the purposes of this case the visa officer states:
"During my interview with the applicant, I raised my concerns that he had experience in the occupation of marine engineer officer described in national occupation classification ('NOC') 2274 and/or in the occupation of marine engineer mechanic described in NOC 7311 and not in other occupations by pointing out to him that the documents submitted by him in support of his application referred to these occupations and not the occupations listed on his application form. I took his explanations of these discrepancies into account in making my decision. Before making my decision, I also noted that the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers (the C.C.P.E.) assessment of the applicant's education, but noted that the C.C.P.E. had not assessed or commented on the applicant's professional experience."
