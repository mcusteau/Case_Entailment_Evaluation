The visa officer's CAIPs notes state:
"... He worked in Israel as a fork-lift truck mechanic. At B.O. Parokhodstvo ('BOP') he says he spent some time working aboard ship and some time on shore. He installed and repaired ships' engines. I pointed out to him that his work book listed him a third mechanic, not engineer. He attributed this to poor translation (yet the Russian version clearly says 'mekhanik' not 'inginier'). From a description of his duties I concluded that subject spent part of the period from Dec 1993 to July 1996 working as a ship's mechanic, and part of the time working as an engineer officer ... I am not satisfied that he has experience as a mechanical engineer."
