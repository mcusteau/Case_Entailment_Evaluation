Dr. Diaz is a qualified psychiatrist, who by the time that he prepared his report in December, 2005, had been treating Mr. Lozano for over a year. His report is crystal clear and unequivocal: Mr. Lozano suffered from a bipolar disorder. As a result, the Board’s statement that it was possible that Mr. Lozano was bipolar exhibits a degree of scepticism on the part of the presiding member with respect to Mr. Lozano’s mental state that was entirely unwarranted in the circumstances.
