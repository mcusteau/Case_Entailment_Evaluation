The Board did not accept counsel’s submission, stating:
We do not accept these explanations. During both hearings, the claimant understood the questions asked to him and understood also what was going on. He was at a los[s]. It is possible that the claimant is bipolar; we understand that he could also have been very nervous at the hearings. This could have explained minor mistakes or some moments of confusion. But his condition cannot explain what appears to be a serious lack of knowledge of major allegations and, the omissions and contradictions in the different documents including the numerous amended versions of his PIF.
The implausibility of many of his allegations … also points to a general lack of credibility of this claim.
