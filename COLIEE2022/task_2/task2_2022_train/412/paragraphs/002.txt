Mr. Lozano seeks judicial review of the Boardâ€™s decision, asserting that the Board erred in failing to properly come to grips with the evidence before it relating to his mental illness, and the impact that his illness had on his testimony. The Board further erred, Mr. Lozano says, by rejecting a document that corroborated his story on the basis that it was undated, when that was not the case, in requiring that he produce documentary evidence corroborating his story, and in making plausibility findings that were speculative and made without regard to the evidence.
