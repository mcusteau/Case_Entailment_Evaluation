  There is no question that FGM is widespread in Mali. The documentary evidence shows percentages of between 80% and 90% of all females in the country. Nevertheless, the documentary evidence, from a variety of sources, also is consistent in its assessment that FGM is carried out at a young age. While the documentary evidence does not state explicitly that FGM is never carried out on older woman, neither does it state that it is. In response to a direct request from the Board as to whether it is ever carried out on older women, the Research Directorate of the Board summarized the documentary evidence that shows that it is carried out on younger victims. It was not unreasonable for the Board to infer from the overwhelming thrust of the documentary evidence that this is a practice that targets young girls and not older women.
