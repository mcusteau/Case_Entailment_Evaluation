  Initially, the Applicant raised an argument that the behaviour of the Board was so egregious as to support a claim of reasonable apprehension of bias. Once, however, the transcript of the proceeding was available, the Applicant conceded that the actions of the Board were not sufficient to support such a conclusion. Nevertheless, the Applicant continues to argue that the interruptions by the Board and the Board's practice of questioning first resulted in a situation where the Applicant was effectively precluded from a fair hearing. In short, the Applicant submits that she was not heard by the Board.
