  Although the  
 Gender Guidelines 
  are not binding on the Board, they must be considered in appropriate cases ( 
 Fouchong v. Canada (Secretary of State) 
  (1994), 88 F.T.R. 37 (T.D.), at paras. 10-11 (F.C.T.D.);  
 Khon v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration) 
 , [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 79; 2004 FC 143, at para. 18). The  
 Guidelines 
  provide some assistance on how to assess credibility in certain cases and set out some examples of the types of credibility considerations that a panel might encounter. For the purpose of this application, the most relevant instructions from the  
 Gender Guidelines 
  are listed under "D. Special Problems at Determination Hearings": 
 
 
 
 "Women refugee claimants face special problems in demonstrating that their claims are credible and trustworthy. Some of the difficulties may arise because of cross-cultural misunderstandings. For example: 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 2. Women from certain cultures where men do not share the details of their political, military or even social activities with their spouses, daughters or mothers may find themselves in a difficult situation when questioned about the experiences of their male relatives."
