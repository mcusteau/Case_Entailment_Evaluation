  Coincidental with the member's equivocal approach to the applicant's version, and perhaps on account of it, his state protection analysis is generalized with little regard for the applicant's personal circumstances. There is little, if any, analysis whether there is protection for individuals such as the applicant who have been targeted by the FARC.
