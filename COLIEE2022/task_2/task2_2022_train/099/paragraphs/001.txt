 Layden-Stevenson, J. 
 : On May 2, 2002, an immigration officer determined that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant granting the applicant an exemption pursuant to section 114(2) of the former  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (the  
 Act 
 ). The applicant seeks judicial review of that decision.
