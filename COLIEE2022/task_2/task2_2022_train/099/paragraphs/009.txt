  With these principles in mind, I turn to the guidelines regarding the assessment of H & C applications and refer specifically to those that are central to the arguments. 
 
 
 
 "7. SPONSORSHIPS AND SPONSORSHIP APPEAL RIGHTS 
 
 
 
 "Sponsorships must be considered properly in the H & C decision-making context. Rights and obligations of sponsors must be consistent whether applications are processed in Canada or abroad. 
 
 
 
 "Generally, an H & C application based on family class relationship is supported by a sponsorship from a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. This is a practical way for relatives in Canada to support an application and to demonstrate their desire to have the family member remain in Canada. However, lack of a sponsorship does not mean that the H & C request should be refused; rather, it is just one of all of the other factors taken into account by the decision-maker. 
 
 
 
 "The sponsorship approval decision must be made before looking at the H & C request. This is so that sponsorship existence or lack thereof and comparative importance of this fact can be considered when making the H & C decision ... 
 
 
 
 "The existence or lack of an approved sponsorship could be a significant factor when the H & C request is based on family reunification. However, there is no legal requirement that applicants be sponsored in order to be considered under R2.1. Where a family class relationship exists and the H & C application is not supported by an approved sponsorship, this is just one factor to be considered along with all of the other aspects of the application. The following sections provide further guidance for specific situations ... 
 
 
 
 "7.1 No sponsorship completed 
 
 
 
 "Where an H & C application based on reunification of relatives who could be members of the family class is not supported by a sponsorship 
 
 
 
 - inform the applicant that an approved sponsorship, although not mandatory, is an important factor in an H & C application 
 
 
 
 - give the applicant an opportunity to have the sponsorship forms completed or explain why there is no sponsorship 
 
 
 
 - make the H & C decision when all the relevant facts are available. 
 
 
 
 "7.2 Sponsorship submitted but refused 
 
 
 
 "Where a sponsorship application was submitted but refused 
 
 
 
 - inform the applicant that the sponsorship has been refused (if this information has not already been relayed) 
 
 
 
 - check FOSS to determine why the sponsorship was refused; if it is not clear FOSS (sic), you may wish to ask the applicant for a copy of the sponsorship refusal letter 
 
 
 
 - make the H & C decision when all relevant facts are available. 
 
 
 
 "8. GENERAL CASE TYPES 
 
 
 
 "H & C applications must be reviewed on a case by case basis. Applicants are free to make submissions on any aspect of their personal circumstances that they feel would warrant being granted the exemption requested. Nevertheless, many cases have common elements. 
 
 
 
 "The following guidelines describe some situations where positive discretion may be warranted. They may be helpful when deciding whether the circumstances presented by the applicant are sufficiently compelling to warrant an exemption from A9(1). They will not answer all eventualities nor can they be framed to do so. These guidelines are to assist you in assessing H & C situations. You cannot be restricted by guidelines; you are obliged to consider all the information you have. 
 
 
 
 "8.1 Spouses of Canadian citizens or permanent residents 
 
 
 
 "Regulation 2(1) defines a spouse, with respect to any person, as the party of the opposite sex to whom that person is joined in marriage. Spouses may submit an H & C application on the basis of the marriage relationship either with or without the support of a sponsorship undertaking. 
 
 
 
 "8.1.1 Spouses sponsored as members of the family class 
 
 
 
 "Canada's long-term policy has been facilitation of admission for those spouses in Canada sponsored by their Canadian citizen or permanent resident spouses. 
 
 
 
 "SPOUSES SPONSORED AS MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY CLASS 
 
 
 
 "First of all determine  
 
 
 
 - Has a sponsorship has (sic) been submitted and approved? If so, the applicant is a potential member of the family class and this can be considered as a favourable H & C factor. 
 
 
 
 "Then consider 
 
 
 
 - Is the marriage genuine? That is, a marriage with the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse and not entered into for the primary purpose of remaining in Canada or gaining admission as a member of the family class. You may wish to consider 
 
 
 
 - the legality of the marriage (see OP 2 - Processing Members of the Family Class, Section 5, Spouses). 
 
 
 
 - the circumstances and timing of the marriage. For example, did the marriage take place after the applicant was refused a visitor extension or when removal was imminent? 
 
 
 
 - How long has the couple been in the relationship? 
 
 
 
 - The religious, social and cultural norms of the applicant's community. 
 
 
 
 - Previous dealings with the Department that might be relevant. For example, a previous marriage of convenience, enforcement action, refused immigration applications, or misrepresentation. 
 
 
 
 - Any other factors that you believe to be relevant to your decision."
