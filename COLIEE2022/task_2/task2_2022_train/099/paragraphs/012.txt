  A review of the guidelines reproduced earlier reveals that an immigration officer is directed to determine whether a sponsorship application has been submitted and approved. I agree with the respondent that the directive was met in this case because the officer who conducted the interview and determined the H & C application also determined the sponsorship application. He approved the sponsorship application after the interview, but prior to determination of the H & C application.
