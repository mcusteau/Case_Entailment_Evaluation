This case law has not been followed in this court. The late and much respected Addy, J., in
Wewayakum Indian Band v. Wewayakai Indian Band
[see footnote 2] led the way. He distinguished the British Columbia jurisprudence and to the extent that he could not do so he disagreed with it. He drew a line between simple historical facts and conclusions or inferences which could be drawn from those facts; the latter were the proper field of detailed study or examination by an expert but the former were every bit as much within the competence of an ordinary witness as any other facts and could properly be the subject of questions on discovery. He described as unacceptable the conclusion that where a claim is based on matters which are beyond living memory, only expert historians could be admitted to testify as to the facts.
