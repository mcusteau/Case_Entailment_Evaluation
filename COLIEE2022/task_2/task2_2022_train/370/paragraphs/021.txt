Finally, it seems to me that many of the questions objected to under this rubric are essential for the purpose of understanding the Crown's position and tying it down to the facts as pleaded. That is an essential part of the defining of the issues and while such definition is, in the first instance, done by the pleadings, discovery is often an essential second step in order to make clear what exactly it is that separates the parties. The statement of defence in these actions contains many detailed assertions of fact as to the activities both of the Crown and its agents and of the plaintiffs and their predecessors. If the Crown has no knowledge of those facts, the plaintiffs are entitled to know that. If on the other hand the Crown's knowledge of certain historical facts is based upon and limited to statements contained in certain documents the plaintiffs are entitled to know that as well. Neither the plaintiffs nor the Crown should be obliged to go to trial not knowing exactly what it is that the other side knows and relies upon as a provable fact, and what is mere hopeful guesswork.
