Most of all the questions asked are tied directly to allegations in either the statement of claim or the statement of defence and thus meet the primary test of relevance. The Crown's plea that it would be unduly burdensome to answer some of the questions seems to me to miss the mark; this is a large complicated case and the fact that the marshalling of facts and documents may require a great deal of work is something with which the parties simply have to live. Thus, while Samson questions 146 and 148 (particularly the latter) will apparently call for the production of a large number of documents, they are documents dealing with transfers made by the Crown and its agents of rights in the surrendered lands and are thus relevant. In any event, there is no evidence to support the plea of burdensomeness [see footnote 8].
