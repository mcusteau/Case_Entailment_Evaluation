While the usual practice is for examinations on discovery to be conducted orally, the
Rules
make provision for examination by means of written interrogatories and it seems to me that the court should, as a matter of policy, encourage the use of such interrogatories in appropriate cases. They are likely to be far less time consuming and should do away entirely with any necessity for adjourning the discovery to allow the witness to inform him or herself of the appropriate facts.
