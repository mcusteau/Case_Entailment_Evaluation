Accordingly, I find almost all of the objections taken by the Crown under these two headings to be without foundation. Thus, questions asking by what authority something was done should, in accordance with the principle earlier outlined, be read as seeking the factual basis (eg. a letter, superior instructions, etc.) for the actions rather than a strictly legal answer. Likewise questions as to eligibility to vote in surrender polls should be taken as going to the factual basis upon which persons were in fact allowed to vote, such as the presence of their names on the Band list, residence, or otherwise. The same is true of questions relating to membership transfers which relate to the fact of such transfers and not to whether or not they were properly made. Finally questions which ask what facts the Crown relies upon in support of certain of its particular allegations (most of which have in any event been tailored so as to comply with the decision in
Can-Air
, supra footnote 5) should properly be answered.
