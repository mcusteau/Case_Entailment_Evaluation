There is one final comment of a general nature which is related to the particular circumstances of this action. It is, as I have said, an action by three Indian Bands against the Crown. It alleges breaches of the Crown's fiduciary duty towards the plaintiffs and their predecessors over a period of time approximately 100 years ago. It is common knowledge that Indian Bands have few or no written records relating to their past and must, apart from tradition and oral history, rely to a large extent upon the records of the government itself. This casts upon the Crown, in its past and continuing capacity as protector and fiduciary of the Bands, a particular duty to be open and frank in its disclosures. Even within the adversarial relationship created by litigation between them, the Crown continues to owe an historic fiduciary duty to deal fairly and openly with first nations. This is not to say that there are special rules for aboriginal claims, but simply that the nature of any claim is part of the context in which any objection to interrogatories is to be decided and that where a claim is in respect of alleged historical injustice by the Crown, that context may be determining.
