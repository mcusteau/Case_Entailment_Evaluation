[36]
I conclude that for the most part the Crown's objections are without foundation. A very few questions have been brought to my attention which appear to me to be improper and I have identified them above. There may well be a few others falling into the same category which I have not been able to identify simply because of the huge number of questions involved. Accordingly it is my intention to issue an order in which, apart from allowing the objections to the specified questions, I shall dismiss the motion and extend the time under rule 397(1) for the Crown to move to review the terms of my order for any matter overlooked; such motion, if any, shall be served by 15 August 1999 and
made presentable at the next case-management conference on 25 August 1999 in Edmonton.
