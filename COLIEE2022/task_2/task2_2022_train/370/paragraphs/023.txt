There is of course no question that examination on discovery is designed to deal with matters of fact. "Pure" questions of law are obviously an improper matter to put to a deponent. It is likewise with argumentative questions and questions which ask a party to state what evidence it proposes to lead at trial. But the line is rarely clear or easy to draw. Questions may mix fact and law or fact and argument; they may require the deponent to name a witness; they may still be proper. So too, questions relating to facts which may have legal consequences or which may themselves be the consequence of the adoption of a certain view of the law are nonetheless questions of fact and may be put on discovery.
