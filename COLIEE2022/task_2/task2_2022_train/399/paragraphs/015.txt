In my view, the CAIPS notes can constitute the reasons for the visa officer's decision but not the affidavit. The affidavit should only be considered as a means to enter into evidence the CAIPS notes and to elaborate on the information found in the CAIPS notes but not as a late explanation for the decision. The affidavit is usually filed for the purpose of the judicial review and is filed many months or a year after the decision. It is usually based on the CAIPS notes which should reflect the reasoning followed by the visa officer to reject or allow the application. As pointed out in Idedevbo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCT 175, [2003] F.C.J. No. 255, if the visa officer's affidavit is inconsistent with the CAIPS notes, the latter should be considered more accurate considering that they were entered following the review of the file and were closer in time to the actions than the former. In the case at bar, if I compare the visa officer's CAIPS notes and affidavit, it is obvious that the latter incorporates a lot more information than the former which raises the question: upon what documents, information or notes did the visa officer base her affidavit, which was executed a little less than a year after the decision?
