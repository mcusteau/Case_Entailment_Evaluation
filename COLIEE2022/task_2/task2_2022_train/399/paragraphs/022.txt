[22]
However, in view of the conclusion I have reached concerning the absence of adequate reasons, it is unnecessary that an answer be given to this last question. In the case at bar, the visa officer's letter mentions which provisions of the Regulations she relied upon in reaching her decision, but does not provide a reasonable rational permitting one to understand why the applicant does not meet the requirements set out therein in view of the stated duties of the applicant. The visa officer does, as the applicant suggests, "only repeat the fact that the applicant has not borne the title of Foreman, air conditioning and refrigeration, and that he is a surveyor of ships", and states that she is not satisfied that the applicant has experience performing some or a substantial number of the duties associated with the NOC occupation without identity which ones. Based on the above reasons, I do not find that the visa officer's refusal letter and the CAIPS notes considered together constitute sufficient reasons to satisfy the requirements of procedural fairness and fulfill the duty to give reasons. This fatal defect warrants the Court's intervention. Therefore, I will not examine the other issues raised by the parties.
