The visa officer gives essentially the same reasons concerning the performance of a substantial number of duties described in the NOC as those provided in the refusal letter. Unfortunately, if I read the letter and the CAIPS notes together, I cannot find anywhere the underlying rational which led the visa officer to reach her decision. However, the respondent contends that the affidavit sworn by the visa officer and filed for the purpose of the present judicial review exposes the rational of her decision and is sufficient to meet the duty to give reasons for her decision as discussed in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817.
