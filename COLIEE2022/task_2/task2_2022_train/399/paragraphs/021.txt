The affidavit is not being used to substantiate what was said at an interview or complement the CAIPS notes which express the concerns of the visa officer. The refusal letter was dated June 27, 2002 and the affidavit was sworn May 19, 2003. The CAIPS notes were entered into the system on June 26, 2002, the day before her decision. Strangely, the visa officer specifies in her affidavit that the CAIPS notes were "made both during and
after the interview"
(see para. 2 of the affidavit of Margaret Gass sworn on May 19, 2003) although the applicant was "not [...] called for a personal interview with a visa officer" (see visa officer's decision). Indeed, if the visa officer's affidavit is to be considered, it appears that she was obviously well aware that the applicant's experience was better suited to another NOC occupation. She went so far as to identify, in her affidavit, the occupation of an "engineer officer - water transport", which, she states, "involves the operation and maintenance of all ships systems, including engines, etc." This raises a procedural fairness issue:
was there an obligation on the visa officer to ask the applicant whether he also wished to be assessed in this alternative occupation?
