In the submission made by Applicants' counsel by letter dated January 11, 2006 to DVA, which was the submission leading to the decision of May 5, 2006 now under review, Applicants' counsel said at page 5 after reciting the provisions of the "old", and then existing, subsection 34.1(4):
"7. Accordingly, a person is entitled to reimbursement of his or her expenditures for Long-Term Care benefits, if he or she makes a claim within 18 months after he or she receives notice of the entitlement for benefits under the
Regulations
. The notification that is intended by this provision must be notice from the DVA. Neither HYK nor RMK receives any notification from the DVA of HYK's entitlement for Long-Term Care benefits until October 2004 (even if HYK had somehow earlier received notice of these benefits, his mental incapacity would obviously render him incapable of communicating this information, hence such notification to HYK alone would have served no purpose). Upon notification, RMK filed a claim with the DVA, within the 18 months required. Thus, the Krasnicks' claim is timely, and they should be reimbursed for HYK's Long-Term Care benefits without further delay."
