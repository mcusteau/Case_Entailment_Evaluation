[43]
There is no clear language to that effect in subsection 34.1(4). That section was amended effective February 15, 2006 (one day after the first or Dunoso decision). Prior to February 15, 2006 it read:
"A claim for reimbursement or payment must be made by the person or on the person's behalf within 18 months after the latter of:
(a) the day on which the expenditure was incurred, and
(b) the day on which notification is received by or on behalf of the person that the person is eligible to receive benefits, services or care under these Regulations for the health need for which the expenditure was incurred."
