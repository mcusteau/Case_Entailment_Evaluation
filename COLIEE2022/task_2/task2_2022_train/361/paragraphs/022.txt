The DVA says that it was unaware of Horace's condition until Ronald advised it in October 2004 at which time Horace was assessed and action was taken to provide benefits as of that time. Since Ronald did not advise the DVA earlier as to Horace's condition the DVA says that it had no opportunity to conduct its own examination and make its own assessment as to an appropriate course of action. The DVA says that, given the hundreds of thousands of persons that it has to deal with, it is impossible and inappropriate that it should be required to give personal and detailed attention to any one individual when there exists even a suggestion or inference that something of interest may have arisen.
