[25]
In this case, the DVA has an obligation to make provision for the care of veterans depending on their needs and circumstances. Not all veterans in all circumstances are to be given every benefit. Certain benefits are provided for in the
Regulations
depending on "eligibility", a term that will be considered later in these reasons. There is nothing in the
Act
or
Regulations
or other Acts or
Regulations
that requires the DVA to make specific benefits known to everyone or to certain persons or to be prescient and determine from signs, signals or inferences that some persons may be in need of benefits and if so, what benefits and when.
