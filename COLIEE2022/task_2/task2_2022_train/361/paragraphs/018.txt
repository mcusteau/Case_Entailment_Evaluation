The record is clear that, at no time prior to October 2004, did Ronald take any specific steps to make the DVA aware of his father's condition or the reason for his placement in a long-term care facility. Ronald had his father examined by medical specialists in 2000 as a result of which he determined that it would be prudent to put Horace in a long-term care facility. Ronald did not contact the DVA at that time so as to permit them to make their own assessment of the situation and either concur with Ronald's decision or propose alternative courses of action. The Power of Attorney appoints Ronald as mandatary for Horace; he is impressed with high duty of care. Among Ronald's duties as mandatary should Horace be unable to look after himself or administer his affairs by reason of any sickness, deficiency or ineptitude, are those set out as requiring Ronald to:
"2. do all that is necessary and expedient to assure the personal protection of the Mandator, his well-being both moral and material, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, the Mandatary shall:
a) do all things necessary and expedient in order to provide the necessities of life for the Mandator;
b) protect, care for and sustain the Mandator if the latter manifests that he is unable to care for himself;
c) consent to all the needs of the Mandator required by reason of the state of the health of the Mandator of whatever nature, (medical or otherwise) provided that they appear to be beneficial, notwithstanding their effects and which are opportune in the circumstances and that the risks presented are not disproportionate to the anticipated benefits;"
