From 1955 to 1999, Horace lived at home and subsequently in a facility in the CÃ´te St. Luc area of Montreal. In 2000, at the instance of his son, Horace was examined by medical specialists in Montreal who recommended that he be placed in a long-term care facility. Ronald was an orthopaedic doctor but resided and practiced in the United States and deemed it impractical to move his father there. There appears to have been a lack of availability of proper care facilities in the public sector and, after consultation with the specialists who recommended that he be placed in a long-term care facility, Horace was placed in a facility known as Chateau Westmount Nursing Home (sometimes called CW by the parties) on June 17, 2000 where he remained for the rest of his life. The expenses incurred by Horace at such facility were in the order of $4,850.00 per month. They were paid first out of the assets of Horace and later when the assets ran out, were paid by Ronald.
