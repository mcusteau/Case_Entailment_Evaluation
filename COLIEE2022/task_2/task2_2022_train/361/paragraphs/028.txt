The Applicants rely upon
Authorson v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2000] O.T.C. 719; 53 O.R.(3d) 221 (Sup. Ct.) and the finding of Brockenshire, J., especially at page 234 [O.R.], in a class action that, where certain funds were placed in the hands of the DVA to be invested and disbursed on behalf of veterans, that the DVA became a fiduciary in that respect. The case proceeded to the Ontario Court of Appeal [157 O.A.C. 278] and to the Supreme Court of Canada, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 40; 306 N.R. 335; 175 O.A.C. 363, where the Crown no longer denied that it had a fiduciary duty. I find that the circumstances of that case do not apply here. In
Authorson
, there was a specific fund set aside for a specific purpose. In the case here, there is simply a regulatory duty to provide and administer benefits under the circumstances set out in the
Regulations
. No higher or fiduciary duty arises.
