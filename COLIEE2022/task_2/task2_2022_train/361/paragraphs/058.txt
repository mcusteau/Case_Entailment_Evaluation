[58]
This position of the Minister ignores the position taken and findings made by the DVA in the Hebert decision and from which the Minister cannot resile. As to Horace's mental condition, the Hebert decision at page 5 stated:
"From the documentation contained in the Appellant's Submission tab D, under the signature of Dr. P. Lysy, who examined Mr. Krasnick prior to his admission to the Chateau Westmount Nursing Home, it is clear that HYK was admitted to the facility in June 2000, due to a deteriorating mental and physical condition. At the time, HYK was assessed as incapable of managing his affairs and in need of long term care. The medical recommendation was that HYK be transferred to the Chateau Westmount. RK, his son and Power of Attorney, consented to such transfer on June 17, 2000."
