What we do know from the concessions made by the parties is:
• Horace was a "veteran pensioner" at all material times.
• Chateau Westmount was a "community facility" at all material times.
• There is no need to be concerned with subsections 22.1(2) and (3) which deal with income restrictions.
• There is no need to be concerned with sections 23 and 33.1 which go to the level of the rate to be established and deductions. The amount fixed at $4,063.44 per month is satisfactory to all.
