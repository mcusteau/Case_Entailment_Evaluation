Hughes, J.
: This application seeks judicial review of the decision of the Director General, National Operations Division of the Department of Veterans Affairs dated May 5, 2006 denying Horace Yale Krasnick eligibility for reimbursement of Chronic Care Benefits in the period from June 17, 2000 to October 8, 2004. The application seeks to quash that decision and the decisions which it affirms; the application also seeks in the alternative a declaration as to certain sums of money, with interest, and certain declarations as to the
Charter
. For the reasons provided, I find that the application is allowed to the extent that the Minister is to reconsider the matter having in mind these Reasons which indicate that monthly payments for the 18 months preceding October 2004 are allowable, together with interest, all as more particularly set out in these Reasons. The Applicants are awarded costs to be taxed in the middle of Column III.
