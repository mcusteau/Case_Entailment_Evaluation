[6]
The Applicants raised a large number of "issues" some of which were argued at the hearing to a greater or lesser degree. Some new issues were raised at the hearing including some which were endeavoured to be raised only during argument in reply. The issues can, at the end of the day, be reduced to two:
1.
Effective Notice
: Was the DVA required to provide specific notice to Ronald as to benefits available to Horace and if so, as of what time. Even if specific notice was not required, was the DVA required to provide general notice and; if so, was what they did adequate?
If such notice was required but not given, must the decision of May 5, 2006 limiting recovery to on and after October, 2004 be set aside?
2.
Limitation of Recovery
: Was the decision of May 5, 2006 correct, in the result, in limiting recovery to expenses incurred on and after October 2004? If not, must the decision be set aside?
