Given that the Applicants asserted that October, 2004 was the operative date for both making the claim and notification and given that the Minister took the position that the "new" provisions of the
Regulations
were the operative provisions in which case the operative date would again be October 2004, it is appropriate to consider that the limitation period from whichever version of subsection 34.1(4) would apply, operates from October 2004. Thus the provision, in the unique circumstances of this case would operate so as to limit a claim for expenditures to be made reaching back for 18 months from October, 2004.
