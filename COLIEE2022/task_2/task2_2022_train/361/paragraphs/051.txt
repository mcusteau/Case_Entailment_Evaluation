The Applicants take the position in this application, that while the expenditures were incurred monthly, the claim made was for the entire expenditure reaching back to June 2000 and that the quantum of the claim could not be limited, only the time of making it. Here, the claim for all expenses reaching back to June 2000, they argue, was made in a timely way in October, 2004.
