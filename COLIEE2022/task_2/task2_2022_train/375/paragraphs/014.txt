Based on the evidence submitted, this was a perfectly reasonable conclusion for the Board to reach. The applicant maintains that a press release issued in May of 2001 should have been considered by the Board. The press release was not tendered at the hearing or in advance thereto. The applicant alleges that she gave it to her counsel who failed to submit it to the Board. Subsequent to the Board hearing of September 11, 2002, her counsel faxed it to the Board on September 26, 2002. The Board actually made its decision on September 17, 2002 but it was only sent to the applicant on October 30th, 2002. Given that the Board had already rendered its decision (when it received a copy of the press release), it was under no obligation to consider a document that the claimant had ample time to submit. After all, she received the file Screening and Disclosure order form on June 18th, 2002 which clearly indicated that she should produce all documents upon which she intended to rely 20 days before the hearing. There is no denial of procedural fairness here as the applicant alleges.
