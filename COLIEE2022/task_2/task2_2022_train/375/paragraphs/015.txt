The applicant further maintained that it was only the incompetence of counsel that kept this evidence from reaching the Panel on time. This incompetence was apparently manifested through not requesting an adjournment to submit further evidence or faxing the documents to the Panel member prior to the rendering of the decision. However, the applicant's evidence at the hearing as to why she had not produced any documentation was that she did not trust anyone in Kenya enough to get such documents for her. Given this testimony, it was not incompetent of counsel not to have requested an adjournment in the absence of an indication that she now trusted someone enough to get the documents. Without a factual foundation for an allegation of incompetence, and in the absence of a complaint to the Law Society of Upper Canada, this ground for the application must also fail. As Pelletier J. held in Nunez v. Canada (MCI), [2000] F.C.J. No. 555:
I am not prepared to accept an allegation of serious professional misconduct against a member of the bar and an officer of this court without having the member's explanation for the conduct in question or evidence that the matter has been referred to the governing body for investigation. In this case, there was ample opportunity to do one or the other but neither was done. The failure to do so is inconsistent with the gravity of the allegations made. This is not a question of being solicitous of lawyers' interests at the expense of their clients. It is a question of recognizing that allegations of professional negligence are easily made and, if accepted, generally result in the relief sought being granted. The proof offered in support of such an allegation should be commensurate with the serious nature of the consequences for all concerned.
