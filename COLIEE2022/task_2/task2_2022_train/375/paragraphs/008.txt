The Board made several findings on pages 5 and 7 of the Tribunal Record in respect of the claimant's activism:
- "the claimant was unable to place before the panel any persuasive objective evidence of her alleged activism" (p. 5)
- "there is no persuasive evidence that DEEDS was part of the UNFUNGAMANO coalition" (p. 7)
- "there is no persuasive evidence that HAMAC and NLDK have been involved in contentious issues with the government" (p. 7)
- "the panel finds on the balance of probabilities that the claimant was not a member of DEEDS or UFUNGAMANO" (p. 7)
