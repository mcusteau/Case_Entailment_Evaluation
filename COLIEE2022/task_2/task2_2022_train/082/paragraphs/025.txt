  Counsel for the Minister argued Justice de Montigny had erred in setting the standard for serious issue at the level of showing quite a strong case rather than the lower level of simply showing the serious issue was not frivolous or vexatious. I need not decide the question because I am satisfied the Minister has met the higher onus.
