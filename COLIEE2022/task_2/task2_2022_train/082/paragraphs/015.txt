  In conclusion, on this point the statutory and regulatory scheme shows the importance Parliament placed on the identity of a person for the purposes of immigration or entry into Canada, including those persons seeking its protection, expressing a particular abhorrence to human smuggling. Identity is one of the four self-standing classes which Parliament identified in section 58 as warranting special attention for a person's detention or release. Each class, namely, danger to the public, flight risk, inadmissibility on grounds of security or violating human or international rights or lack of identity are independent from each other, each having particular conditions of operation and different conditions of application.
