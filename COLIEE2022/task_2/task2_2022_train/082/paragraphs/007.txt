  The conjunctive test which the Minister must satisfy the Court in order to obtain a stay pending the determination of the Minister's application for leave and judicial review of Member Shaw Dyck's decision is well known. The Minister must establish: (1) one or more serious issues to be tried; (2) he would suffer irreparable harm if the stay was not granted, i.e. if the respondent was released on the conditions imposed by the Member; and (3) the balance of convenience favours the Minister.
