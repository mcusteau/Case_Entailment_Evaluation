  Two of my colleagues have issued recent decisions on stay of release from detention applications by the Minister of persons who arrived on the MV "Sun Sea". Mr. Justice de Montigny rendered two decisions in Court files IMM-5560-10 and IMM-5368-10, both decided on September 17, 2010. He dismissed the Minister's stay applications. Madam Justice BÃ©dard rendered her decision on September 23, 2010, in which she granted a stay of a release order. She held that on the particular facts of the case before her, there was a manifest lack of evidence on the respondent's identity.
