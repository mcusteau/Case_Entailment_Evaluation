 [17] 
  The heart of Member Shaw Dyck's decision releasing the respondent is expressed in the following terms: 
 
 
 
 So I am satisfied then that although the Minister is not satisfied with your identity and that they have made reasonable efforts to establish your identity thus far, and what remains to be done on the Minister's behalf can readily be accomplished with you outside of detention, I am satisfied that release on terms and conditions can address the issue of your ongoing co-operation with the Minister as well as any lingering concerns they may have with respect to flight risk, danger and security that have been addressed in terms and conditions in the past 
 . [My emphasis] 
 
 
 
 So I will invite the Minister to contribute to the terms and conditions of release.
