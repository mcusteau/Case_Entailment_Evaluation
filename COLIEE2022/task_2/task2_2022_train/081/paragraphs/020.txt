  I do not accept the submission that the Board erred in law with respect to the test it applied. The IAD did not err by stating that "it is appropriate to consider a higher threshold in her case and therefore there needs to be more positive humanitarian and compassionate factors." Section 67 of the  
 Act 
  specifies that for the IAD to allow an appeal there must be "sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations [that] warrant special relief  
 in light of all the circumstances of the case 
  [emphasis added]." What the IAD was doing was weighing the H&C factors  
 in light of all the circumstances of the case 
 ; that being the applicant's gross and repeated misrepresentation. It is trite law that the seriousness of an offence can be weighed against other H&C factors: see  
 Ribic v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 
  [1985] IABD No 4, approved by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Chieu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 
  2002 SCC 3.
