  I have previously addressed the issue raised here in  
 Chand v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 
 , 2008 FC 548 at para 26 where I wrote: 
 
 
 
 Second, in  
 Hernandez 
 , Justice Hughes was faced with a situation where a document containing a recommendation that was submitted to the Minister's Delegate was not disclosed prior to the admissibility hearing.  
 Here it is argued that these were not disclosed to counsel prior to the section 44(2) review. That is an administrative process. I can find no error of law either in the failure to disclose prior to the section 44(2) review or the Minister's Delegate having relied on those documents 
  [emphasis added].
