  In any event, as the respondent notes, the IAD acknowledged that in most cases it is in the best interests of a child to have both parents in their lives, accepted that the applicant played an important role in her daughter's life and that her removal will cause hardship to the child, noted that it is up to the applicant and her husband whether they should live in Pakistan or whether the child will remain with the applicant's husband in Canada, and also noted that the applicant's husband and daughter could visit her in Pakistan. Another consideration made by the IAD was that the applicant's current husband could submit a sponsorship application for the applicant in two years time, rendering the separation only temporary.
