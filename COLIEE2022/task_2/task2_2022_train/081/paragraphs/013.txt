  Subsequent to her interview scheduled for April 2, 2007, the applicant requested a copy of the complaint letter dated July 31, 2005, sent by her ex-husband. It is submitted that (i) the letter should have been shared with her prior to the interview and (ii) she should have been given a copy after the interview when she requested it by letter dated April 11, 2007. It is further submitted that the officer should not have sent a letter to the applicant's ex-husband requesting further information without prior disclosure to her. It is submitted that this is a breach of procedural fairness and the IAD should have exercised its jurisdiction under s. 67(1)(b) of the  
 Act 
  and found that a principle of natural justice had not been observed.
