Currie v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 899; 143 A.C.W.S.(3d) 1125 (F.C.), at paragraph 5:
"Â¶ 5 The appropriate standard of review of the decision of the Board is patent unreasonableness, since the question of whether or not the Applicant's disability was caused by his military service is a question of fact [...] Stated in other terms, the Board errs only if it based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact, made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the evidence [...]" (Footnotes omitted)
