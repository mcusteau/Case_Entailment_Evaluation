In
Skouras v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 113; 146 A.C.W.S.(3d) 366 (F.C.), I undertook a functional and pragmatic analysis to conclude that the standard on which to review the Veterans Review and Appeal Board deciding pension claim is patent unreasonableness for questions of fact, and reasonableness simpliciter for questions of mixed fact and law. I held at paragraphs 11 to 14:
"¶ 11 For the first factor, the presence of s. 31 of the
VRAB Act
, which deems decisions made by the Board to be final and binding, means that the Board's decisions attract curial deference.
"¶ 12 For the second factor, the Board has a greater relative expertise in deciding pension claims than does the Court. As a result, deference is owed to the Board's determination of factual questions.
"¶ 13 The third factor is the purpose of the legislation; in this case, the applicable legislation is the
VRAB Act
and the
Pension Act
. The purpose of the
Pension Act
, as identified in the preamble, is to 'provide pensions and other benefits to the members of the forces'. A liberal interpretation of the
VRAB Act
is mandated by s. 3, with the aim of recognizing the Crown's obligation to members of the forces and their dependents. These purposes favour deference to the Board's decisions.
"¶ 14 With respect to the nature of the question, the Court will treat the Board's factual findings with more deference than its interpretation of legal principles. Questions of fact are reviewed on the standard of patent unreasonableness, while questions of mixed fact and law attract a standard of reasonableness simpliciter."
