After applying for this pension, the applicant was referred by the Department of Veterans Affairs for a psychological assessment by Keli Furman, Ph.D., Psychologist. Her report dated January 20, 2003 stated on the fourth page:
"Mr. Cramb's responses to the PDS, a test screening for the presence of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, indicate that Mr. Cramb meets the criteria for a diagnosis of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder that is Severe in Level of Impairment in Functioning and that his experienced symptoms are moderate to severe, more closely towards the severe end with a Score of 33 in this range of 21 to 35. The etiology appears related directly to his perceived mistreatment by the military, which he describes as including physical imprisonment, psychological torture, a serious accident while under suspension and ongoing harassment."
Accordingly, Dr. Furman found that the applicant has Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and that its etiology or causation "appears related directly to his perceived mistreatment by the military".
