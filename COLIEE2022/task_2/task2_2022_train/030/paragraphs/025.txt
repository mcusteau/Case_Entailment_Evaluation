 [25] 
  There are three requirements that must be met if a delay is to be considered unreasonable: 
 
 
 
 1) The delay in question has been longer than the nature of the process required,  
 prima facie 
 ; 
 
 
 
 2) The applicant and his counsel are not responsible for the delay; and 
 
 
 
 3) The authority responsible for the delay has not provided satisfactory justification.
