The defendant's specific complaint here is that paragraph 21(b) of the statement of claim, which alleges that the
Pneumocort
trademark is not distinctive, is overly general and does not alert the defendant to the case it must prepare for trial (paragraph 14 of written submissions). Leaving aside that here the defendant's complaint is one in connection with preparation for trial, as opposed to particulars for pleading, the plaintiffs have again led up to the distinctiveness point and conclusion of law by being very specific as to the use of the plaintiffs' trademark; the specific wares, drugs for the treatment of pulmonary disease marketed under the trademark; the method in which they are used; the similarity of the defendant's trademark, wares, and manner in which they are used; the importance of the trademark to the plaintiffs, including as to market share; and the confusion that has resulted or may result in future. All of this clearly indicates what the conclusions of law in paragraph 21 of the statement of claim refer to and make the pleadings quite specific.
