  More importantly, however, even if this had somehow become apparent to Passport Canada, it was not incumbent on it to arrange for translation facilities for the applicants. The applicants filed with the Court a copy of the "Rules of Procedure in Passport Refusal and Revocation Cases" of Passport Canada, which are available on the Internet. Those rules clearly provide that correspondence with Passport Canada is to be conducted in English or French (i.e. one of Canada's official languages) and that if someone files a document in a different language, it is up to that individual to provide an accurate translation, accompanied by a declaration from a translator, setting out the translator's credentials and attesting to the authenticity of the translation. Passport Canada's procedure in this regard is similar to that of this Court: Rule 93 of the  
 Federal Courts Rules 
 , SOR-98-106 provides that translation shall be arranged for witnesses who do not understand English or French, and that it is the responsibility of the party who calls the witness to arrange and pay for the translator.
