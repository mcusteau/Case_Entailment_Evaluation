  As the respondent correctly notes, the principles regarding the requirements of procedural fairness for administrative decisions were set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Baker v Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , [1999] 2 SCR 817, 174 DLR (4th) 193 [ 
 Baker 
 ]. In  
 Baker 
  at paras 21 to 27, the Supreme Court noted that the requirements of procedural fairness will vary depending on the nature of the decision and the impact on the interests of the person affected. Factors relevant to the content of the duty include: the nature of the decision and of the procedures followed by the tribunal in making it or the "closeness of the administrative process to the judicial process"; the requirements of the statute under which the decision is made and the role of the particular decision within the statutory scheme; the importance of the decision to the individuals affected; the legitimate expectations of the affected individuals regarding what procedures would be followed by the tribunal; and the choices made by the tribunal regarding procedure, especially where the tribunal is afforded the right to establish its own procedures.
