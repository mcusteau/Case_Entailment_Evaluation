  Their claim on the language issue, moreover, rests primarily on the extraordinarily narrow basis of a single line in a witness statement, which the applicants provided to the Edmonton police on January 15, 2010, when they claim they first noted that their passports were missing.

 sic 
 ]". The applicants argue that this single line, and the fact that the applicants filed two letters that contradicted each other, ought to have put Passport Canada on notice that the applicants lacked sufficient English language abilities to fully comprehend and participate in the investigative process.
