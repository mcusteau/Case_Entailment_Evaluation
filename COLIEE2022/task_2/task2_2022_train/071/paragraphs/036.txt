  The fruitless lines of inquiry that Passport Canada did not disclose to the applicants have no bearing on the applicants' ability to make full answer and defence to the case that the Passport Canada investigators had put together. The central point in any defence was the theory that it was Mr. Slaeman's son who stole and sold the passports. The ability of the applicants to raise this argument was in no way impacted by the non-disclosure of the fruitless inquiries that Passport Canada conducted. Moreover, these fruitless lines of inquiry were not considered by Passport Canada in its recommendation to the adjudicator nor by the adjudicator in his decision. In addition, and most importantly, the fact that these lines of inquiry proved fruitless is in no way relevant to whether it is more likely than not that the applicants allowed a third party to use their passports. Thus, the fact that Passport Canada conducted certain inquiries that led nowhere is simply not material to the case.
