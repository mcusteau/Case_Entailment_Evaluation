  More specifically, in their Memorandum of Fact and Law, the applicants raise several grounds of challenge, arguing that: 
 
 
 
 1. Passport Canada's investigation was incomplete and flawed; 
 
 
 
 2. Passport Canada engaged in an improper assessment of the evidence; 
 
 
 
 3. The adjudicator's conclusions were arrived at without a proper (or any) evidentiary basis; 
 
 
 
 4. The investigative branch of Passport Canada concluded that the applicants were complicit in allowing the impostors to use their passports at the beginning of the investigation and prior to receipt of all of the information; and 
 
 
 
 5. The evidence does not support a finding on a balance of probabilities that the applicants were parties to the use of the passports by the impostors.
