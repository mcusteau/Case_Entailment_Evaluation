  Thus, both grounds raised by the applicants regarding an alleged breach of procedural fairness are without merit. I also note that there is absolutely no merit whatsoever in the suggestion that the procedures before this Court were unfair in not allowing the applicants to cross-examine the Passport Canada investigators. Such cross-examination would be completely inappropriate in a judicial review application, for the reasons advanced by the respondent. Thus, the applicants were afforded appropriate procedural fairness by Passport Canada and before this Court.
