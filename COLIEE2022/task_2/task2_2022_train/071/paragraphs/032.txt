 [32] 
  In terms of the disclosure, on December 3, 2010, Passport Canada's Chief Investigator wrote a detailed letter to each of the applicants, in which he set out all the material facts that Passport Canada gathered in its investigation. The letters provided in this regard [differences in the letter to Nsaeif Slaeman are noted in square brackets]: 
 
 
 
 Passport Canada received information from the Migration Integrity Officer (MIO) in Dubai that on January 15, 2010, an impostor attempted to board flight EK241 from Dubai to Toronto, using Canadian passport WL615418 [or WL615414], issued in your name. The impostor was also found to be in possession of Canadian citizenship certificate B0736668 [or A8422217], issued in your name. 
 
 
 
 The MIO also reported that passport WL615418 [or WL615414] contained a visa from the Syrian Arab Republic, which was issued by the Syrian Embassy in Ottawa on January 4, 2010. Information received from the Syrian Embassy confirmed that they did issue the visa contained in passport WL615418 [or WL615414]. According to the Syrian Embassy, it takes between 7 to 10 days to process an application for Syrian visa, and applicants are advised to take mailing time and holidays into account (i.e. five to eight working days are required). 
 
 
 
 They also note that a photograph of the applicant is required when applying for a visa. Since January 4, 2010, was a Monday, and five to eight working days are required to process a visa application, this would indicate that passport WL615418 [or WL615414] would have to have been received by the Syrian embassy no later than December 24, 2009, which meant that it would have had to have been mailed by no later than December 23, 2009. 
 
 
 
 Passport Canada records indicate that at the time of application for passport WL615418 [or WL615414], you requested that it be sent to you by mail and according to verification from Canada Post, the passport was delivered to you on December 22, 2009. 
 
 
 
 On March 12, 2010, you submitted an application for a Canadian passport to Passport Canada's Edmonton office. In support of this application, you submitted a Statutory Declaration concerning a lost, stolen, damaged, destroyed or inaccessible Canadian passport or travel document (PPTC 203), dated January 24, 2010. On the PPTC 203, he declared that Canadian passport WL615418 [or WL615414], issued in your name on December 17, 2009, was stolen from your car at the Londonderry Mall in Edmonton on January 15, 2010. You also declared that passport WL615418 [or WL615414] was last seen or used on January 15, 2010, at 1:30 PM. 
 
 
 
 In additional correspondence from you dated May 11, 2010, you explained that after passport WL615418 [or WL615414] was delivered you placed [gave it to your wife who placed] the passport in a black travel document bag, which was placed in a briefcase, and stored in a cabinet in your bedroom. You also indicated that during the first week of January 2010, your husband [you] removed the black travel document bag from your house and placed it in your car, assuming that the passport was still in the bag, and only noticed it was missing on January 15, 2010, when you went to the travel agent at the Londonderry Mall. 
 
 
 
 In an additional letter from you dated September 16, 2010, you indicated that your citizenship card was also stored in the same bag [you indicated that you moved the travel document bag from your house to your car in the first week of January 2010, that your citizenship card and Edmonton picture identification were also stored in the same bag and that you realized that these documents were missing at the same time as the passport]. 
 
 
 
 Passport Canada's investigations are administrative in nature, and evidence is assessed on a balance of probabilities test - that is, given the information held on file, what is more likely to have happened. When considering your explanation, in order for your version of events to be accurate, the following would have needed take place: 
 
 
 
 1. After passport WL615418 [or WL615414] was delivered to you and stored in your bedroom on December 22, 2009. Between then and December 23, 2009, someone broke into your home, went into your bedroom, removed the briefcase from your cabinet, removed the black travel document bag, removed passport WL615418 [or WL615414], your citizenship card and your city of Edmonton picture ID, then placed the travel document bag back inside the briefcase and then put the briefcase back inside the cabinet and left. As you never mentioned a break-in at your home as a possible explanation as to how passport WL615418 [or WL615414] could have ended up in the possession of an impostor, one must presume that nothing else was taken from your home. 
 
 
 
 2. After obtaining passport WL615418 [or WL615414] from your home, the thief completed an application for a Syrian visa and mailed it to the Syrian embassy within 24 hours after stealing this passport. During that time, they were also able to locate an individual who looked enough like you that the visa application was not questioned at the Syrian Embassy when photographs on the visa application were compared to your photograph in passport WL615418 [or WL615414]. 
 
 
 
 3. On January 15, 2010, an impostor attempted to use passport WL615418 [or WL615414] to travel to Canada illegally from Dubai. That same afternoon, after the impostor was apprehended, he realized that passport WL615418 [or WL615414] had been stolen and reported this to police.
