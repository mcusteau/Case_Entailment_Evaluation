  In my view, these explanations and theories are an invitation to the Court to come to its own conclusions, based on evidence that was not before the adjudicator, which is well beyond the scope of judicial review on the reasonableness standard. Rather, what is required is that the Court assess the reasonableness of the adjudicator's decision based on the record that was before him. And that record reveals that the adjudicator made a completely reasonable decision on the evidence before him and drew completely reasonable inferences. In short, the applicants provided no credible explanation as to what had happened to their passports, and changed their version of events multiple times when, as the investigation progressed, it became apparent that previous versions were untenable. In the circumstances and based on the evidence before the adjudicator, the only reasonable conclusion which could have been drawn is the one the adjudicator reached, namely, that the applicants were complicit in allowing the passports to be utilized by someone else.
