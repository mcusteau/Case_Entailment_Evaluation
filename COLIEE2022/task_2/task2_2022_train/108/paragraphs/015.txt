  When rendering his decision in  
 Pentney 
 , Justice Lemieux clearly relied heavily on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v. Hogervorst 
  (2007), 359 N.R. 156; 2007 FCA 41 ( 
 Hogervorst 
 ), even though it dealt with the discretion of the Federal Court in similar circumstances. As discussed at the hearing, another decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in a similar context,  
 Jakutavicius v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2004), 327 N.R. 239; 2004 FCA 289 ( 
 Jakutavicius 
 ) may be useful to determine the extent to which the Commissioner should provide reasons for his decisions. It is to be noted that motions for an extension are often dealt with in brief orders by the Federal Court and that the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed that there was generally no need for extensive reasons in such cases. What is important, as noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Via Rail Canada Inc. v. National Transportation Agency et al. 
 , [2001] 2 F.C. 25; 261 N.R. 184; 193 D.L.R.(4th) 357 (F.C.A.) is that a decision that is subject to judicial review must contain enough to enable the parties to assess their possible grounds of review and for the Court to exercise its jurisdiction.
