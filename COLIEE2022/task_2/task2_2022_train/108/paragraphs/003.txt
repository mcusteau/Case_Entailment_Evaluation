  On May 3, 2006 the Minister received an undated letter from Mr. Blondahl which appears to be, and is treated as, an appeal of the Minister's decision on the reconsideration of the application. Given that, pursuant to s. 82 of the  
 Act 
 , this appeal is before a Review Tribunal, the Minister forwarded this letter to the Office of the Commissioner of the Review Tribunals (the Office of the Commissioner). In a letter dated June 12, 2006, the Office of the Commissioner informed Mr. Blondahl that his letter of appeal was received beyond the 90 day period set out in the  
 Act 
  but that the Commissioner had the discretion to extend this delay and would consider this should Mr. Blondahl provide a detailed explanation as to why his appeal is late.
