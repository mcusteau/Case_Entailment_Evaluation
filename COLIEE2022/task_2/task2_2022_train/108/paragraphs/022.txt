  However, as noted by Justice Gilles Létourneau in  
 Hogervorst 
 , it is for the Commissioner to keep in mind that "a time-limit for the commencement of challenges to administrative decisions is not whimsical." (para. 24). On the contrary, as indicated in  
 Budisukma Puncak Sendirian Berhad et al. v. Canada et al. 
  (2005), 338 N.R. 75; 2005 FCA 267, in a passage cited by Justice Létourneau, at para 24: 
 
 
 
 "It exists in the public interest, in order to bring finality to administrative decisions so as to ensure their effective implementation without delay and to provide security to those who comply with the decision or enforce compliance with it, often at considerable expense."
