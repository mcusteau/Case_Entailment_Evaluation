  Originally, given the value of the decision of Justice Fran√ßoix Lemieux in  
 Pentney 
  as precedent, the question of whether the Commissioner considered the proper factors in the exercise of his discretion was reviewed on the basis of the correctness standard. More recently, Justice Roger Hughes in  
 Canada (A.G.) v. Schneider 
 , 2008 FC 764, (2008), 169 A.C.W.S. (3d) 444 ( 
 Schneider 
 ) indicated that given that the factors have been determined in  
 Pentney 
 , the issue now was one of mixed fact and law (the application of the test to the facts) to which the reasonableness standard should be applied. At the hearing, the Attorney General agreed with this position.
