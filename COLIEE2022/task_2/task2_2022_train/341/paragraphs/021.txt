The plaintiff's claim appears to be that the Minister's decision was improperly addressed, by reason of the omission, from the description of the addressee, of the formal name of the plaintiff corporation, "928412 Ontario Limited". I am not so persuaded. Here the addressee's name used was that under which the plaintiff carries on business and which had, in previous correspondence, been used in part by it for identifying itself for the purpose of requesting and receiving notice from the Minister. There is no evidence that the registered mail containing the Minister's decision did not reach the plaintiff as intended, or that there was any real confusion as to whom the intended addressee was. Nor does the evidence support the plaintiff's submission that the defendant failed to serve notice of the Minister's decision on the "person who requested it" pursuant to s. 130(1) of the
Act
