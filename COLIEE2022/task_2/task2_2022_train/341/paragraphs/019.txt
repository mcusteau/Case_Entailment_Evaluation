The plaintiff also raises as an issue the effective date of notice of the decision of the Minister. In particular, the plaintiff submits that pursuant to s. 131(2), notice is to be served on the "person who requested" the decision, and in this case the plaintiff corporation is named properly as "928412 Ontario Limited". The notice of the Minister's decision is said to have been improperly addressed, to "Satellite Supply Division" to the attention of David Woodall. As a result of this error, the plaintiff submits that notice was not effective until it received actual notice of the decision on November 4, 1996. Accordingly the plaintiff submits, it is on this date, the date of actual receipt, and not the date of mailing, that the limitation period specified in s. 135(1) commences.
