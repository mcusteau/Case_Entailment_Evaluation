The term "file" is defined in rule 2(1) of the
Federal Court Rules
as "to file in the Federal Court Registry". While this definition may on its face appear to be rather tautological, the term, in my view, contemplates more than simple mailing of an initiating document to the court by registered mail. First, the definition of "filing" contained in rule 2(1), suggests, by the phrase "in the Federal Court Registry", that a document must be received by or "in" the Registry before it is considered to be filed.
