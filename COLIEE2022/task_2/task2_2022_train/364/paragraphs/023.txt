It must be remembered that this Court in its discretion always had jurisdiction to proceed to hear a case on the merits notwithstanding a foreign forum selection clause. On this point see
Ship Eleftheria, Re
, [1969] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 237; [1969] 2 All E.R. 641 (C.A.), fully approved by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Pompey (Z.I.) Industrie et al. v. Ecu-Line N.V. et al.
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 450; 303 N.R. 201; 2003 SCC 27. However, the jurisprudence, particularly in Canada, had developed such that a Court which otherwise had jurisdiction should in its discretion grant a stay in the light of a foreign forum selection clause. In reality Canadian proceedings would almost automatically be stayed unless the plaintiff would be unlikely to get a fair trial for political, racial, religious or other reasons. There is no suggestion that the plaintiffs would not get a fair trial in Hong Kong or in the United States.
