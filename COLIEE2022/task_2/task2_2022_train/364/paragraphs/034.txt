Taking into account that the shippers, consignees, the cargo and the ports of loading and discharge had no connection with Canada and that some respect had to be given to the English court's anti-suit injunction, he granted a stay. He also referred to the principal policy objective of s. 46 as being the protection of the interest of Canadian exporters and importers, a policy not stated in the section itself. He concluded at para. 80:
"While section 46 preserves the jurisdiction of Canadian courts in proceedings brought by foreign shippers and consignees, it does not follow that, in deciding whether to exercise its jurisdiction, a court should depart from its normal practice of affording respect to foreign judgments. On the facts of the present case, including the dominant role being played in the litigation by the Canadian insurers of the cargo, it would not frustrate Parliament's purpose to take the English judgments into account in the course of determining the more convenient forum."
