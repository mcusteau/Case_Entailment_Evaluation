[43]
The basic rule, which should not be forgotten, is that the choice of forum rests with the plaintiff. The Court so chosen may decline to proceed with the case; in this instance on the ground of forum non conveniens. However the factors connecting this case to Hong Kong, or for that matter New York, are not clearly more significant than those connecting it with Canada. Given that the impact of a foreign forum selection clause has been significantly reduced by s. 46 of the
Marine Liability
Act
and that there has been no allegation of proceedings in any other Court, unlike in both the
OT Africa
and
The Cougar Ace
cases, in the exercise of my discretion under s. 50 of the
Federal Courts
Act
, I dismiss the motion for a stay. The Moving Parties shall have 30 days to file their Statement of Defence.
