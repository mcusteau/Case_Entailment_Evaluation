The Bill of Lading calls for the application of Hong Kong law and for Hong Kong jurisdiction, except as regards the performance of carriage itself. The Bill of Lading was obviously designed to cover worldwide trade. It stipulates that liability is to be determined in accordance with any national law making the
Hague Rules
, or the
Visby Protocol
thereto, compulsory applicable or if no such law is compulsory applicable then in accordance with the
Hague Rules
as contained in the
Brussels Convention
of 1924. No evidence was led as to the state of Hong Kong or Taiwanese law. However, more specifically in the event of a shipment to or from the United States, the shipment was contractually, if not legally, subject to the
Hague Rules
as enacted in the U.S.
Carriage of Goods by Sea
Act
,
1936
(
COGSA
).
