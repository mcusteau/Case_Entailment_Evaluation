The language of s. 46 is somewhat convoluted. On the facts of this case, it provides that notwithstanding a foreign jurisdiction clause, the plaintiffs may institute proceedings in Canada, as if the contract had referred the claim to Canada, since the defendants have an agency here. However, as previously discussed, the real issue is whether the Federal Court should maintain jurisdiction, i.e., to use the words of s. 46, to "determine" the claim on its merits.
