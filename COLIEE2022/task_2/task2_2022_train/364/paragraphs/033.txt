[33]
At paragraphs 33 and 34, Mr. Justice Evans distinguished
ECU-Line
and
The Castor
as follows:
"Although the meaning of these passages may not be beyond dispute, I do not agree with counsel's interpretation of them. In my view, Justice Bastarache was saying that, when one of the statutory conditions for jurisdiction is satisfied, subsection 46(1) removes the court's discretion to stay proceedings solely because of a foreign forum selection clause. Justice Bastarache was thus not addressing the question in our case, namely, whether subsection 46(1) also removes the Court's discretion to order a stay when, taking all relevant considerations into account, it is not the more convenient forum.
"I interpret in the same manner the passage in the reasons given for this Court by Nadon, J.A., in
Incremona-Salerno Marmi Affini Siciliani (I.S.M.A.S) s.n.c. v. Castor (The)
, [2003] 3 F.C. 220, 2002 FCA 479 at para. 13 and referred to above by Justice Bastarache."
