The Record which is somewhat sparse, and perhaps understandably so, considering that this is a Simplified Action with respect to a claim for less than $50,000, is that the plaintiff Rich Palm Enterprise Corporation Ltd. of Taiwan sold a cargo of what is described as roller chains and parts to its co-plaintiff Hitachi Maxco Ltd. of Kennesaw, Georgia, U.S.A.
