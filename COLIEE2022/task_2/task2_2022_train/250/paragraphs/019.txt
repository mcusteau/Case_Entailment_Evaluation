Had the futility of this application been an argument sprung on Mr. Wheaton only at the time of the Canada Post Corporation motion to strike out, I would hesitate in awarding any substantial costs. However, Mr. Wheaton knew, at least as early as November of 1997, well before he commenced the present action, that the Privacy Commission of Canada was satisfied that Canada Post had no further undisclosed material. It is unreasonable for Mr. Wheaton to have thought that he might obtain some relief from the Court when there had been no failure to disclose. To initiate and pursue this application, in the face of advice from the Privacy Commissioner as to full production and without any evidence, be it by cross-examination on affidavits or otherwise, to indicate that there might be some documents hidden by Canada Post and in the face of the clear requirement of a refusal in section 41 of the
Privacy Act
, is frivolous, vexatious and abusive. The respondent shall thus have lump sum costs of this proceeding, which has been unnecessarily complicated by Mr. Wheaton, both through the nature of the material which he has filed and in the motions which have been required.
