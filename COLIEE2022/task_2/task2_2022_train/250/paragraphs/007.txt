The remedy of Canada Post, that of striking out the application, is founded upon a passage written by Mr. Justice of Appeal Strayer in
Bull (David) Laboratories (Canada) Inc. v. Pharmacia Inc. et al.
, [1995] 1 F.C. 588; 176 N.R. 48 (F.C.A.), at p. 600 where he comments, to the effect, that an application generally ought not to be struck out, but should proceed to trial. However, he then went on:
"This is not to say that there is no jurisdiction in this Court either inherent or through Rule 5 by analogy to other rules, to dismiss in summary manner a notice of motion which is so clearly improper as to bereft of any possibility of success. Such cases must be very exceptional and cannot include cases such as the present where there is simply a debatable issue as to the adequacy of the allegations in the notice of motion."
The test, in this instance, is whether Mr. Wheaton's application "is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success.". The Federal Court has followed this principle in many instances, for example in
Labbé v. Létourneau, J., et al.
(1997), 128 F.T.R. 291; 146 D.L.R.(4th) 180 (T.D.), at p. 300 where Mr. Justice MacKay wrote:
"[25] An application for judicial review ordinarily is considered on its merits in an expeditious process and it is unusual to strike out an originating motion for such review without hearing the merits. Nevertheless, it is clear that the court will dismiss an originating motion in a summary manner where the motion is without any possibility of success. (
