The case law is clear that in order to come within section 41 of the
Privacy Act
, which is the only grant of jurisdiction to the Court under that legislation, Mr. Wheaton must establish a refusal of access to personal information. Not only has Mr. Wheaton neglected to plead a refusal of access, but faced with sound evidence that he has been provided with all of the material which Canada Post has, he has not in anyway refuted that evidence. All of this constitutes exceptional and special circumstances for the Court can only hear Mr. Wheaton's application for judicial review if he brings himself within section 41 of the Privacy Act, which he has failed to do for: as I have said, section 41 of the
Privacy Act
requires that there in fact be a refusal of access to personal information. A refusal of access is condition precedent to an application under this section. This application by Mr. Wheaton is one which is bereft of any possibility of success. The application for review is struck out.
