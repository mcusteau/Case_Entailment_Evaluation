  As stated by Strayer, J., as he then was, in  
 Deprenyl Research Ltd. v. CanGuard Health Technologies Inc. 
  (1992), 41 C.P.R.(3d) 228 (T.D.), a "counsel's eyes only" order should only be granted in very unusual circumstances. The onus is on the moving party to establish the need for such a restriction on ordinary disclosure. In  
 Glaxco Group Ltd. et al. v. Novopharm Ltd. 
 , [1998] F.T.R. Uned. 323; 81 C.P.R.(3d) 185 (T.D.), Stone, J.A., speaking for the Federal Court of Appeal, specifically approved  
 Deprenyl 
 , supra, and held such orders represent a serious inroad into the right an opposite party ordinarily has of seeing all documents relevant to the case. A "bald" statement that such an order is necessary is insufficient.
