  It must be remembered that an expert who appears as a witness is not a "hired gun" of the party paying for his or her professional services. The duties and responsibilities of the expert witness were well set out by Cresswell, J., in  
 National Justice Compania Riviera S.A. v. Prudential Assurance Co. (Ship Ikarian Reefer) 
 , [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep. 68 (Q.B.). He said, based on well established authority, which has survived its transatlantic voyage unscathed, expert evidence presented to the Court should be, and should be seen to be, an independent product of the expert uninfluenced as to form or content by the exigencies of litigation. The expert witness should provide independent assistance to the Court by way of objective unbiased opinion in relation to matters within his or her expertise (pg. 81). Although the English Court of Appeal reversed him it was not because of his views on expert witnesses. In the appeal, which is reported at [1995] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 455 (C.A.), Stuart-Smith, L.J., noted that during the course of his judgment Cresswell, J., twice referred to the fact that one of the experts was not called as a witness. He expressed surprise and put that fact into the balance against the defendants. It was held he should not have done so. The fact that the expert was not called was wholly irrelevant "and there was a perfectly satisfactory explanation for not calling him". Under our current  
 Rules 
  there is no need to identify experts consulted but not called as witnesses. It goes without saying that therefore there is no need to give any explanation at all.
