  The role of experts in litigation is somewhat complex. A party might consult with an expert without ever having the intention of calling him or her as a witness. A party may hire an expert in contemplation of calling him or her as a witness and then not do so because the opinion does not support its case. Under our current  
 Federal Court Rules 
  there is no need to inform the other party that an expert has been consulted, or that an expert will be called as a witness, save that expert evidence intended to be relied upon must be disclosed shortly before trial.
