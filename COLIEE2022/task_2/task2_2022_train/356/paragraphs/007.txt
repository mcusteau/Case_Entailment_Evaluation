Since becoming licensed, Mr. Roberts started a law practise dealing primarily with immigration law which services the Niagara Region including both parts of the United States and Southern Ontario. In addition, Mr. Roberts states that he was employed at two H&R Block offices - one in the United States and one in Canada preparing tax returns for clients. As a result, he commuted across the border into Canada to work, all the while returning to his home in Buffalo which he owned with his two siblings.
