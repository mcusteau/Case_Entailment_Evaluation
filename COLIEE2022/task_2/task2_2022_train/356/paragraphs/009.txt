On 31 March 2008, Citizenship Judge Robert M. Morrow approved Mr. Roberts' application for citizenship. The decision contained short, hand-written observations made by the Citizenship Judge in relation to the six factors enumerated in
Koo (Re)
, [1993] 1 F.C. 286 (T.D.), [1992] F.C.J. No. 1107 (T.D.) (QL), for determining residency. Briefly, the Citizenship Judge concluded that Mr. Roberts was present in Canada for a long period; that his two siblings live in Buffalo; that his physical presence indicates a returning home and that ninety percent of Mr. Roberts work and income is derived in Canada; that he has spent more time in Canada than outside; that his absences from Canada were temporary; and that Mr. Roberts' connection with Canada is more substantial than with the United States. In these reasons, the judge revised the number of days absent from Canada from 76.5 to 469 and the number of days present in Canada from 1075 to 685.
