While I have some sympathy for the circumstances that led to the Respondent's failure to establish a residence in Canada during the material period it seems clear that the Citizenship Judge was guided more by Mr. Roberts' future intentions with respect to establishing a residence and erred in his judgment by not clearly addressing this issue. Federal Court jurisprudence also demonstrates that establishing such a residence is a condition precedent before proceeding to an examination as to whether the applicant in question has maintained such a residence. In the case of Mr. Roberts, upon even the most generous reading of the Citizenship Judge's decision and the material before him, it is clear that the Respondent did not establish a residence in Canada and for that reason alone the appeal must be allowed.
