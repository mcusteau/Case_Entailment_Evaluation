Mr. Roberts applied for Canadian citizenship on 18 May 2007. On his citizenship application, Mr. Roberts declared an absence of 76.5 days and a physical presence of 1075 days in Canada. Subsequent to his application, he was invited to an interview with a Citizenship Judge to assess the extent of his residency. The forms prepared by officers at Citizenship & Immigration Canada indicate that Mr. Roberts was referred for an interview due to the fact that he had an address in the United States and only a P.O. Box in Canada. In addition, officers noted that Mr. Roberts' days of physical presence (as indicated by him on his citizenship application) were below the number required for citizenship.
