The basic issue raised before me by the applicant's able counsel is that the immigration officer, in considering the applicant's obligations towards his family in India, had gone beyond the scope of the Regulations. Counsel argues that such obligations can only be material to an application when these obligations relate to dependents residing in Canada. The low-income cut-off guidelines to assess this kind of economic security in determining successful or potentially successful establishment in Canada may not be applied in the context of the Regulations to dependants living or residing abroad.
