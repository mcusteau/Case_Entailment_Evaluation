According to applicant's counsel, the word "dependant" as found in the Regulations means a dependant who is in Canada when the application for landing is made. That restricted meaning to the word "dependant" finds its parallel in the definition of "relative" which is limited to members of that class residing in Canada. "Members of the family class" under s. 4(1) is limited to a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. Likewise is the residency requirement found in s. 7 of the Regulations when dealing with the sponsorship of applicants by designated persons.
