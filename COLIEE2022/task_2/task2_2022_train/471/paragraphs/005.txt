In July 2002, Lin Li's father went to the applicant's home and told him to stop giving this type of information to his daughter, which the applicant did. However, after she found out that the applicant was to come to Canada in December 2003 to visit LaSalle College in Montreal with his employer, Lin Li asked him to send her information about Falun Gong from Canada. The applicant arrived in Canada on December 5, 2003, and did as she had asked.
