From the Commission's chronology of events, it is known the applicant's complaint was reassigned to RER, the initials of Rae Raymond, Human Rights Officer at the Canadian Human Rights Commission. Again, little is known in the record how Mr. Raymond proceeded in the conduct of his duties. He did not provide any affidavit in these proceedings. What is known is that he prepared a document dated July 25, 1997 entitled "SECTIONS 40/41 ANALYSIS" which is a one-page document with no analytical back-up as was seen with the Dunphy Report. This is not surprising because ss. 40 and 41 of the
Act
authorize Commission action not to deal before a substantive investigation of a complaint takes place.
