v. C.N.R.
(supra), Jerome, A.C.J., faced a situation where a first investigator's report had been received by the Commission and had been circulated to the parties for comment. Another investigator was designated in the words of Jerome, A.C.J., "thereafter, for reasons which are not entirely clear, the defendant requested the Commission to conduct a further investigation into the complaint". The second investigator's report and the parties' submissions were before the Commission when the Commission made its decision. However, the first investigator's report and the parties' comments on that report were not before the Commission when it made its decision. The Associate Chief Justice allowed the judicial review application and set aside the Commission's decision for these reasons:
"[9] The factors to be taken into account by an administrative tribunal when exercising its decision-making powers may, in some cases, be discerned by examining the enabling legislation. In the present case, it is true the Commission is free to adopt or reject the finding of an investigator as set out in his or her report and is not required to examine the complete record of an investigation.
Nevertheless, once it designates an investigator under s. 43(1) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, it is my view the Commission is bound to consider the resulting report since that document is indisputably relevant to the question before it of whether the circumstances of the case warrant further action
