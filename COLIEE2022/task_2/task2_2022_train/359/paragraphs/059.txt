The
Act
is clear in imposing a statutory obligation upon the Commission to consider an investigator's report received by the Commission. A breach of that statutory obligation is a fundamental breach requiring, in my view, setting aside a Commission decision. It is an error of law. A plain reading of s. 44 of the
Act
compels the conclusion that the receipt of an investigator's report is the trigger to any subsequent substantive Commission action.
