In terms of investigation findings, the Dunphy Report said this:
"41. Investigation confirms that the complainant enjoyed a progressive career with the respondent and was promoted to a Superintendent at Halifax in April 1993. Investigation shows that the complainant started to demonstrate stress related symptoms for which he sought psychological, psychiatric, and medical assistance.
"42. Investigation shows that, in January 1995, during a respondent investigation of the complainant having abused his authority, they obtained additional information from a respondent secretary [in Mr. Brine's unit] and the General Manager of the Halifax Ports Corporation regarding allegations of unacceptable performance by the complainant.
"43. Investigation shows further that during the investigation, the Chief Superintendent witnessed the complainant exhibiting symptoms of an emotional breakdown, and that the Chief Superintendent recommended to the respondent [Ports Canada] on 30 January 1995, that the complainant was under intense emotional strain and that psychological counselling and time-off were in order.
"44. Investigation shows that on 29 March 1995, two months following the Chief Superintendent's recommendation that the complainant receive psychological counselling and take time-off, and while the complainant was off on sick leave, the respondent [Ports Canada] presented the complainant with a letter that his employment was to be terminated. Evidence provided by the complainant's psychologist shows that the complainant was not emotionally capable of representing his interests when he signed the settlement."
