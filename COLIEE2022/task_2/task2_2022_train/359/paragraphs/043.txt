In contrast, there are only a few decisions of the court involving cases where the Commission decided under s. 41 of the
Act
not to deal with - not to investigate - a complaint. Examples of such types of cases are
Slattery v. Canadian Human Rights Commission
(1994), 81 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.), a decision of MacKay, J., dismissing a judicial review application of such a decision and
Gill v. Public Service Commission
, 25 C.H.R.R. D/439 (F.C.T.D.), per Reed, J., quashing such a decision.
