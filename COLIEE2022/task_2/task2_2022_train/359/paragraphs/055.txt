Where a question of jurisdiction was at issue, Rothstein, J., adopted the approach of the court as expressed by Thurlow, A.C.J. (as he then was), in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Cumming
, [1980] 2 F.C. 122 (F.C.T.D.), at pp. 132-133 of that reported case:
"The preferable course for the court is to leave the Tribunal free to carry out its inquiries and not to prohibit it save in a case where it is clear and beyond doubt that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to deal with the matter before it."
