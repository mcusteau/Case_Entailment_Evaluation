On July 25, 1997, Sherri Helgason, Manager, Complaints and Investigations at the Commission, wrote to the applicant and to Ports Canada advising:
"The investigation into the complaint filed by Bruce Brine against Canada Ports Corporation alleging discrimination in employment on the ground of disability has been completed. A copy of the investigator's report is attached for your review. This report will be submitted to the Commission at one of its upcoming meetings, along with any comments we receive from you or the complainant.
"As you will see from the investigation report, it is being recommended that the Commission
not deal with the complaint because the complainant entered into an agreement with the respondent
. The Commission may accept or reject this recommendation. If you would like to comment on the report, you can do so by writing to the undersigned." (emphasis mine)
