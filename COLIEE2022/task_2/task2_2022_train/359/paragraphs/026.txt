The Canadian Mental Health Association also made a submission dated September 11, 1997 which stated:
"Sadly, Mr. Brine's case resembles that of many other mental health consumers who have had to cope with emotional, often work-related problems in an unsupportive environment. Frequently the employee's difficulties are amplified when the realities of stressful working conditions and related emotional problems are denied by the employer. Is it acceptable that such individuals are asked to take decisions in an emotionally charged and unsupportive environments, at a time when they are extremely vulnerable? Employees can be presented with a 'take it and leave' offer which can be viewed as a form of coercion into accepting an unsatisfactory resolution. Employers then, can hide behind a shield indicating that an agreement has been reached. We are extremely concerned that this is what may have occurred in Mr. Brine's case."
