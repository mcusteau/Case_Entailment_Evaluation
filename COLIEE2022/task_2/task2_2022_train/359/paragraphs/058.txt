[58]
Despite the lack of a CHRC affidavit in these proceedings explaining how the Commission handled Mr. Brine's complaint, the record is clear:
(a) The Dunphy Investigation Report was received by the Commission on April 4, 1997;
(b) The Dunphy Report was not circulated to the parties for comment which is a procedural requirement of fairness before the Commission decides;
(c) Three months later, after receiving the report, the file (Mr. Brine's complaint) was reassigned to Mr. Raymond;
(d) Mr. Raymond did not, as such, reinvestigate Mr. Brine's complaint but rather he simply performed a section 40/41 analysis setting out the considerations which might lead the Commission to decide not to deal with Mr. Brine's complaint prior to investigation although an investigation had already been performed;
(e) The Dunphy Report was not before the members of the Commission when they decided not to deal with Mr. Brine's complaint under s. 41(1)(d) of the
Act
;
(f) The Raymond section 40/41 analysis was before the Commission when it made its decision. So were the Adjudicator's entire reasons.
