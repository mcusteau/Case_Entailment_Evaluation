DÃ©cary, J.A., in
Holmes
(supra), emphasized what the court said in
Bell
(supra), on the proper general approach to be followed by the court in dealing with the challenges to Commission decisions. First, he focussed on decisions taken by the Commission under s. 44 of the
Act
and quoted this from
Bell
, supra:
"[35] It is settled law that when deciding whether a complaint should be referred to a tribunal for inquiry under ss. 44 and 49 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, the Commission acts 'as an administrative and screening body' (
Cooper v. Canada (Human Rights Commission)
, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 854, at p. 893, La Forest, J.) and does not decide a complaint on its merits (see
Northwest Territories v. Public Service Alliance of Canada
(1997), 208 N.R. 385 (F.C.A.))."
