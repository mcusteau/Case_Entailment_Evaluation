In my view, the Commission was obligated to assess and consider the circumstances under which the settlement and release were entered into between Mr. Brine and Ports Canada from the perspective of the
Act
, that is to determine whether, under the circumstances, sufficient evidence warranted requesting a Human Rights Tribunal to "inquire into the complaint" enabling that Tribunal, after hearing all of the evidence, to determine what scope to give, if any, to any of the remedies provided for in the
Act
. The record is clear that the Commission failed to conduct this required analysis. Some of those issues were touched upon in the Dunphy report but, as noted, that report was not before the members of the Commission when they made their decision.
