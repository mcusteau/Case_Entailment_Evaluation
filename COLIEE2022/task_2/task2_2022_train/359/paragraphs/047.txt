I read the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and the Federal Court of Appeal, cited above, as establishing the principle of a general degree of deference to Commission decisions. However, both courts were sensitive of the principle that the degree of deference to be accorded to particular and specific Commission decisions will depend upon the circumstances, and, in particular, upon the nature of the decision taken and the statutory context. Such an analysis, in my view, points to granting less deference to a Commission decision made under s. 41 of the
Act
not to investigate a complaint as contrasted with the larger degree of deference when the Commission decides, after investigation and a consideration of submissions by affected parties, to dismiss a complaint under s. 44 of the
Act
or to request the constitution of a Human Rights Tribunal to inquire into a complaint which may grant appropriate remedies. Indeed, in my view, within s. 41 itself, because of the wording in each paragraph, a varying degree of deference is appropriate because the level of discretion conferred by Parliament to the Commission is not the same in each of those paragraphs in s. 41.
