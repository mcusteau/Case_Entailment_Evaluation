, supra, the court per Marceau, J.A., found:
"I do not believe that the Minister needs to be compelled to follow formal guidelines as to the factors he should take into account in forming his opinion, and I consider the Minister's opinion in respect of public danger as reliable as that of a court. ... The procedure set up and actually followed affords the individual concerned full opportunity to make his or her case which, I think in the circumstances, satisfied the demands of the "audi alteram partem" maxim. I see no reason to require an oral hearing in this case as in any other similar case."
However, this court has found a serious issue to be tried with regard to the validity of Minister's opinions [see footnote 3]. On the material before me, including the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent, I am satisfied that there is a serious issue to be tried with regard to the validity of the Minister's opinion. The affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent attempted to show the basis for and, I take it, the reasonableness of the report made by an immigration officer, which apparently formed the basis for the Minister's opinion. However, the affidavit was not that of the immigration officer. The notes attached to the affidavit as an exhibit indicate some commentary of the officer who made the report, and indicate some of the considerations taken into account. I am satisfied, however, that there is an issue as to whether all of the relevant considerations went into the formation of the opinion, and whether all of the relevant evidence was considered.
