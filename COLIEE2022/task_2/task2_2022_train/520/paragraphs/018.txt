I am satisfied that, on the facts before me, there would be irreparable harm to the applicant if the stay were not granted and the deportation order were executed followed by a favourable determination for the applicant on the application for leave and for judicial review. I conclude that the fact of having been declared by the UNHCR to be a Convention refugee does not raise a presumption that an applicant will face persecution if returned to the country from which he or she sought refuge. In both
Bavi
and
Shahranpour
, as here, a considerable amount of time had passed since the refugee determination; the conditions in the country at the time of the hearing of the application for a stay, and the documentary evidence in support thereof, are what matters. As Nadon, J., did on the evidence before him in
Shahranpour
, I find also that there is insufficient evidence that the Iranian regime punishes those convicted of drug-related offences in Canada to the extent advanced on behalf of the applicant. However, beyond these considerations, the factual basis for this applicant's claim to irreparable harm is not the same as in
Bavi
and
Shahranpour
. I find that there was adduced before me sufficient evidence that the applicant could come to irreparable harm if returned to Iran, as a result either of his desertion from the army, or because of his conversion to Christianity, or both, particularly when those factors are considered together with his refugee status and criminal record.
