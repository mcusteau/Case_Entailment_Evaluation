I am also concerned that the foregoing quotation from
Nguyen
related to an opinion formed in a different context, one relating to an individual who arrived in Canada without status, but alleging entitlement to Convention refugee status, as opposed to one relating to an individual with landed or permanent resident status on the basis of a UNHCR determination of refugee status. I conclude that it can reasonably be argued that
Nguyen
does not apply on the facts before me and in the circumstances of a determination under s. 70(5).
