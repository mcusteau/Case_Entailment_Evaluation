The applicant became a permanent resident of Canada on July 11, 1991, having been declared a Convention refugee by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (the "UNHCR") in Cyprus. He had fled his country of origin, Iran, during the Iran-Iraq war, after deserting from the Iranian military. Since arriving in Canada, the applicant has accumulated a criminal record that includes convictions for theft, failure to comply with a recognizance, and trafficking in a narcotic. His two convictions for trafficking resulted in concurrent sentences of two and one-half years. His criminal activity was apparently related to his heroin addiction. The deportation order issued against the applicant followed shortly after the applicant was released from incarceration for the trafficking offences. An appeal of the deportation order was filed with the Immigration Appeal Division, and was scheduled to be heard on 28 March, 1996. This appeal process stayed the execution of the deportation order by virtue of s. 49(1) of the
Act
