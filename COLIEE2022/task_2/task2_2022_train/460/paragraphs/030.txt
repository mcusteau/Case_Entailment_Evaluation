If the strict rules of evidence were imposed on informal administrative processes, such as the PRRA determination process, their ability to function effectively and promptly would be impaired. While counsel would be well-advised to tender evidence through their client's own mouths, circumstances may exist where this is not possible or is impracticable. As Justice Rouleau observed in
Rh√©aume v. Canada
(Attorney General)
, 2002 FCT 98, at para 28, "[p] arliament has seen fit to give administrative tribunals very wide latitude when they are called on to hear and admit evidence so they will not be paralyzed by objections and procedural manoeuvres. This makes it possible to hold a less formal hearing in which all the relevant points may be put to the tribunal for expeditious review".
