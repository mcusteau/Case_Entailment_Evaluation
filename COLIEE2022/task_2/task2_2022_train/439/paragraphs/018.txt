Counsel for the applicant argues that rule 332(1) does not apply because it is inconsistent with (is narrower than) rule 1603(1). Counsel for the respondent argues that there is no inconsistency and rule 332(1) merely describes the type of evidence that can be attested to in an affidavit. Rule 332(1) clearly contemplates affidavits of two types: one based solely on personal knowledge; one that contains evidence on information and belief as well as personal knowledge. The dichotomy set out in rule 332(1), as to when each is admissible, does fit well in the judicial review procedure provided for in Part V.1 of the
Rules
. I would not interpret the
Rules
as requiring the application of rule 332(1) to judicial review proceedings.
