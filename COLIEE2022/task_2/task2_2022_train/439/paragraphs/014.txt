The
Federal Court Immigration Rules
, 1993, do not contain any absolute prohibition concerning hearsay. Rule 12(1) provides:
"Affidavits filed in connection with an application shall be confined to
such evidence as the deponent could give if testifying as a witness before the Court
." (emphasis added)
