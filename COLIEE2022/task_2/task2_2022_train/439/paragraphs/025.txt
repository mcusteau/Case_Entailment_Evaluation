Counsel for the applicant asked that I award costs to his client, in this case, on a solicitor/client basis. The usual rule is that costs are not awarded to either party in judicial review proceedings. Counsel for the applicant argues that the motion to strike has created unnecessary costs for his client, which the client should not have to bear. It is argued that the motion to strike was frivolous and completely unwarranted on the basis of the facts and the applicable jurisprudence.
