The decision in
Moldovenau v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] N.R. Uned. 135 (F.C.A.), is of no assistance to the respondent. It only deals with whether or not the certification of a question was necessary in the circumstances of that case for the appeal to proceed. Equally, I do not find
Wang v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 121 N.R. 243; 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 178 (F.C.A.), useful. That decision predates the
Pharmacia
decision. More importantly, it did not deal with a preliminary or interlocutory motion to strike. The
Wang
decision dealt with a decision by the reviewing judge, when making a decision on the merits, to disregard (strike from the record) a memorandum written by the visa officer but filed under cover of an affidavit sworn by another officer. Indeed, it appears that the "striking from the record" did not formally occur until sometime after the decision on the merits was made (see footnote 1 on page 182). The issue before the Court of Appeal was not whether a motion to strike an affidavit was appropriate in the judicial review context, but the result that should follow when a judge has decided that a certain part of the evidence should not be relied upon and then the judge relies upon it. The Court of Appeal found that the judge's decision could only have been made by reference to the evidence that had been found to be inadmissible.
