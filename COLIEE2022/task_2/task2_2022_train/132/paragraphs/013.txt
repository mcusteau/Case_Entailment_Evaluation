 [13] 
  Once again, I want to reiterate the fact that this Court cannot lightly interfere with the discretion given to immigration officers. The H & C decision was a fact driven analysis, requiring the weighing of many factors. I find that the immigration officer considered all of the relevant and appropriate factors from a humanitarian and compassionate perspective, and did not commit any errors which would justify this Court's interference.
