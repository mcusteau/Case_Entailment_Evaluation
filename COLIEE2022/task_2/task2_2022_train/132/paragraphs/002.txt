  The applicant, his wife Mi Sook Lee, and his three daughters Ye Jin Lee (23), Su Jin Lee (22) and Han Na Lee (20), are all citizens of Korea. Although not entirely clear why it is that the applicants left Korea, it is mentioned that the applicant was blacklisted there for his views on seeking a means of achieving a re-unification of North and South Korea and that he feared persecution because of this. He and his family therefore left Korea and arrived in Toronto on March 29, 1996. Since that time, the applicant worked as a pastor in two Korean churches in Toronto, and moved to Vancouver in 1999, where he began work at another church. His wife came with him to Vancouver, but his daughters stayed in Toronto to continue with their schooling.
