  The Supreme Court's recent decision in  
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9 ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 ), has meant that judicial review of the decisions of administrative tribunals is now subject only to two standards: that of "correctness" and that of "reasonableness". That case also urged courts once again to treat the decisions of specialized administrative tribunals such as the panel with deference, as they have a certain expertise in cases within their jurisdiction.
