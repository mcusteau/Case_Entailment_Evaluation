The Applicant's basic argument is that some of the things he did (i.e. the development and application of mathematical models) overlap with functions that occur in ES groups. But this does not mean that the Committee's recommendation not to place him in an ES group was patently unreasonable. He was asked to provide the benchmarks that would give him an ES designation, but he declined to do this. He left it to the Committee. There is nothing before me to suggest that the Committee got it wrong when it gave him an SI ranking. They merely went to the benchmarks and followed the process.
