The classification grievance process is not an adversarial process, and in my view neither griever nor employer has a vested right to respond to the other's submissions to the Committee. Appendix B to the Policy states as follows:
"[...] Employees and/or their representative must be given the opportunity to appear before the committee and state their views on the classification of the position. They must withdraw from the meeting once their presentation is complete. Representations by the complainant or his or her representative may also be submitted in writing. All aspects of the decision being grieved, i.e., group and sub-group allocation, level and ratings (where applicable) accorded to all factors, must be examined even though, in some instances, not all are being challenged.
"If invited to appear before the classification grievance committee to provide information on the assigned duties and responsibilities, management must withdraw once the committee has completed its questioning."
The Policy does not grant the griever the right to respond to management's answers.
