In the present review, the Applicant submits that the Committee breached its duty of fairness by failing to grant him an opportunity to respond to management's answers to questions that deal with the relationship of his work to the overall management of the OAS and CPP programs. At the hearing, he explained to the Court that his concern was management's indication that his work was reviewed and approved by management before it went out. He says the fact that management's signature does not appear on the relevant documentation supports his position. But my review of the approval sheets produced by the Applicant suggests that at least some of them were signed by a director or team leader. So the only hard evidence I have on this issue does not support the Applicant. More importantly, however, there is no evidence that this issue was material to the Decision.
