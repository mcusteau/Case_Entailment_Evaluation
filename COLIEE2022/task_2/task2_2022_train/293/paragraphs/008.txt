The second Committee convened the Applicant's hearing on 30 June 2004, at which time he represented himself in oral submissions supported by twenty-eight documents. The Committee reconvened on July 6, 2004 to review the Applicant's evidence and to ask questions of a management representative who was the Applicant's direct supervisor at the time his position was classified in June 1995. On July 12, 2004 the Committee requested that the Applicant provide in writing, prior to July 30, 2004, his assessment of which benchmarks in the ES Standard would support his proposed classification. On July 19, 2004 the Applicant requested a copy of the ES Standard and the job description of the employee then performing his former position functions. These materials were provided to the Applicant. On August 3, 2004 the Committee again contacted the Applicant, who advised that he would make no further submissions because he had already provided the evidence to support his proposed rating. In its Classification Grievance Report, dated late August 2004, the Committee recommended thatthe Applicant's position remain classified as SI-03.
