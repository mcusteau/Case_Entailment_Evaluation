On March 31, 1998 the Applicant grieved both the job description and classification of his position under s. 91 of the
PSSRA
. The grievance was denied at the third and final level on October 18, 1999, after which the Applicant and HRDC entered into a mediation agreement on February 16, 2000. While the dispute concerning the position's job description was resolved, the classification was further grieved by the Applicant to the Committee. The Committee convened on November 20, 2003 and, on February 18, 2004, recommended reclassifying the Applicant's position to SI-04.
