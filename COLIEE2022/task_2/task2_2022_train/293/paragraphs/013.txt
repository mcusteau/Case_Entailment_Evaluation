The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Dr. Q., Re
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170, is authority for the proposition that where an enabling statute delegates authority to an administrative decision-maker, the reviewing judge must determine the appropriate standard of review on the pragmatic and functional approach. However, in
Canadian Union of Public Employees et al. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour)
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539; 304 N.R. 76; 173 O.A.C. 38, at paragraph 100, the Supreme Court clarified that questions of natural justice and procedural fairness relate to the procedural framework of a delegate's decision and do not require the reviewing judge to engage in a standard of review inquiry. It falls for the Court to determine the content of the duty of fairness as a question of law using a standard of correctness.
