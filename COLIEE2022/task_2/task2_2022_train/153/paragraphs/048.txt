 [48] 
  I recognize that the decisive emphasis placed by the RPD on an applicant's failure to take all reasonable steps to engage the police was found to be unreasonable in a recent decision of this Court, in circumstances in which the evidentiary record suggested that the police may not have provided adequate protection even if the applicants had sought their protection ( 
 Majoros v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2013 FC 421). To the extent that this decision may be inconsistent with the jurisprudence discussed above, I respectfully decline to follow it and it was reasonably open to the RPD to do the same.
