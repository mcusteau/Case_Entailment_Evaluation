  Nevertheless, to the extent that the jurisprudence can be said to have established a clear test for what constitutes "persecution," within the meaning of section 96 (see, e.g.,  
 Canada (Attorney General) v Ward 
 , [1993] 2 SCR 689, 1993 CarswellNat 90, at para 71 [ 
 Ward 
 ];  
 Rajudeen v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1984] FCJ No 601, 55 NR 129, at p 133;  
 Tolu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2002] FCJ No 447, at para 16 [ 
 Tolu 
 ];  
 Prato v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 1088, at para 7 [ 
 Prato 
 ];  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Hamdan 
 , 2006 FC 290, at paras 25-26 [ 
 Hamdan 
 ];  
 Yurteri v The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2008 FC 478, at para 34 [ 
 Yurteri 
 ];  
 Warner v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 363, at para 7;  
 Mallampally v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , 2012 FC 267, at paras 23-24; and  
 Savas v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2013 FC 598, at para 7 [ 
 Savas 
 ]), this, in my view, would fall within the narrow category of "exceptional" situations identified in  
 Alberta Teachers 
 , above, at para 34. In the face of settled law on the meaning of the term "persecution," it is not open to the RPD to adopt a different interpretation of that term. Accordingly, the question of whether the RPD erred in interpreting the test for what constitutes "persecution" within the meaning of section 96 is reviewable on a standard of correctness.
