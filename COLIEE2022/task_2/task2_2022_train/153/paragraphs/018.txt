  In my view, the meaning of the term "persecution" in section 96 of the IRPA raises a question of law that is of central importance to the legal system. However, it would be difficult to maintain that this question is outside the RPD's area of expertise. Indeed, it is difficult to think of a subject matter that would be more squarely within the RPD's expertise.
