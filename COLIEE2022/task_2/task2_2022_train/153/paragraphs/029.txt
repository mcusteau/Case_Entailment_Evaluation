 , above, at para 57). Moreover, "[t]he more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her ( 
 Kadenko 
   
 v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , [1996] FCJ No 1376, at para 5 (FCA);  
 Avila 
   
 v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 359, at para 30). However, in all cases to which the presumption applies, the burden is upon an applicant for refugee protection to demonstrate, with clear and convincing evidence, the state's inability to provide adequate protection ( 
 Ward 
 , above, at paras 57, 59). This burden must be discharged on a balance of probabilities ( 
 Carillo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FCA 94, at paras 20, 30 [ 
 Carillo
