  I agree. This is readily apparent from a review of paragraphs 25-31 of the RPD's decision, which appear at the end of its analysis. Although the RPD correctly identified (at paragraphs 9, 18, 28 and 31) the test to be applied in terms of "adequate state protection," it failed to assess whether the various steps that have been taken and the various efforts that have been made by the state to provide such protection actually provide adequate protection, at an operational level, to people of Roma ethnicity in Hungary. This is evident from the language used throughout this part of its assessment, which includes phrases such as "Hungary is making best efforts to offer state protection," "serious efforts with adequate protection would be reasonably forthcoming" and "Hungary has undertaken serious and substantial efforts to ensure the future existence of the Roma and other minorities are protected."
