  Ultimately, the RPD determined that (i) Mr. and Mrs. Ruszo had not taken all reasonable steps to seek state protection, (ii) steps were taken to protect students at their son's school, (iii) Hungary has undertaken serious and substantial efforts to offer state protection when requested and (iv) it has made significant improvements in providing such protection. Based on these determinations, the RPD concluded that the Applicants had "not provided clear and convincing evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, state protection in Hungary is inadequate."
