In my view, the fact that the applicant intends to visit his wife and his children back in Pakistan once a year is not a relevant factor to be used against him in the context of his personal suitability. Secondly, the comment that the applicant has not taken steps "to elevate his level of education" is hardly appropriate in the applicant's case. Personal suitability is defined as follows under Schedule I of the
Immigration Regulations
:
"9. Personal Suitability - Units of assessment shall be awarded on the basis of an interview with the person to reflect the personal suitability of the person and his dependants
to become successfully established in Canada
based on the person's adaptability, motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other similar qualities." (my emphasis)
