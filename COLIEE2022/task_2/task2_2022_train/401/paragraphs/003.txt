Further to Balisky v. Canada (Minister of National Resources), [2004] F.C.J. No. 536 (A.O.) at para. [6] and Aird v. Country Park Village Properties (Mainland) Ltd., [2005] F.C.J. No. 1426 (A.O.) at para. [10], I have no authority to assess costs in the face of an order silent on costs. A judgment for costs of the action cannot carry an interlocutory disposition of costs. Accordingly, I disallow the items 5 and 6 claims (preparation and appearance respectively) relating to the motion for further and better particulars. It follows that the associated disbursement of $114.49 for service and filing of the motion materials is disallowed. The item 5 and 6 claims for the motion to strike are allowed as claimed at the maximum amounts plus the associated disbursement of $89.88 for service. An item 21 claim is made for the preparation of each motion. Both are disallowed because item 21 applies only to interlocutory matters during an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. Item 26 (assessment of costs) is allowed as presented at the maximum value. The Defendant's bill of costs, presented at $6,086.77, is assessed and allowed at $2,689.08.
