  Here, the Canadian officials who were responsible for processing Mr. Baro's application for permanent residence, based on a spousal sponsorship, asked him for a "marriage check". Obviously, this request alerted Mr. Baro to the fact that those officials wanted to know if he had been married before. In my view, in these circumstances, Mr. Baro was obliged to disclose his marital history. True, he complied with the request for an official certificate of marriage registration. However, his compliance with that request did not absolve him of the obligation to divulge his previous marriage and the steps he took to have his first wife presumed dead. Mr. Baro could not have reasonably believed that he was not withholding material information.
