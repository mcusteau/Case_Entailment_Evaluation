  The Board concluded that the Minister's allegation was well-founded and, therefore, that Mr. Baro was inadmissible to Canada. It found that Canadian officials had requested a "marriage check" in the form of a certificate from the National Statistics Office. In providing a certificate indicating that no marriage was registered in his name, Mr. Baro had misrepresented the facts. Further, by omitting to mention the existence of an order recognizing that his first wife was presumed dead, Mr. Baro had failed to disclose a material fact. At a minimum, immigration officials would have wanted to know more about the circumstances surrounding his first marriage, but Mr. Baro had succeeded in foreclosing that area of inquiry. In doing so, he may have induced an error in the administration of the
