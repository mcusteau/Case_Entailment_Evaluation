  In 2000, Mr. Baro joined Ms. Tuzon in Canada. However, when Ms. Tuzon visited the Philippines in 2002, she found out about Mr. Baro's first marriage and discovered that Ms. Gandeza was very much alive. Ms. Tuzon alerted Canadian immigration authorities to the fact that Mr. Baro had not been forthcoming is his application for permanent residence, which set in motion the proceedings before the Board and the IAD. In both proceedings, the Minister alleged that Mr. Baro had misrepresented or failed to disclose a material fact, namely, his marital history.
