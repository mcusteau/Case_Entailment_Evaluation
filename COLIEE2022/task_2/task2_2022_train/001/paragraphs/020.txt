  At the 30-day detention review hearing, the Board member was required to explain why he decided to depart from his colleague's earlier decision without examining the bondspersons. The Board member did not have evidence as to whether these bondspersons asserted sufficient control over the Respondent. The Federal Court of Appeal held, in  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham 
 , 2004 FCA 4, [2004] 3 F.C.R. 572 (C.A.):

 must give clear and compelling reasons for departing from previous decisions 
 ." (Emphasis added).
