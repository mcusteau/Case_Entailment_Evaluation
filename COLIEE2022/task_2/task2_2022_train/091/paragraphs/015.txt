  I begin by observing three general principles of law. First, the identification of persecution behind incidents of discrimination is a mixed question of fact and law. The Federal Court of Appeal has said that it is for the CRDD to draw the conclusion as to whether conduct constitutes persecution in a particular factual context by proceeding with a careful analysis of the evidence adduced and a proper balancing of the various elements contained therein. This court is not to intervene in the conclusions of the CRDD unless they appear to be capricious or unreasonable. See:
