  The CRDD went on to write: 
 
 
 
 "The principal claimant was asked why he thought nothing had happened to him during the five year period 1994 to 1999. He said he had sought to avoid confrontation, that he'd avoided problem areas. The principal claimant said that he was not politically involved or sophisticated. According to  
 British Home Office Country Assessment: April 2000 
 , three million Kurds live in the Istanbul conurbation. This document suggests that Kurds at risk there are those with a political profile or those suspected of connection or sympathy with the PKK. The panel finds that the principal claimant lacks a political profile. We further find that as of his release in 1994, the principal claimant was not viewed by agents of the Turkish government as a supporter of or sympathizer with the PKK. Accordingly we do not find that there is more than a mere possibility that the principal claimant would face persecution should he return to Turkey." (footnotes omitted)
