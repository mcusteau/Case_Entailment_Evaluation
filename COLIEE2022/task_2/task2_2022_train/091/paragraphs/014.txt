  Mr. Tolu raised two issues with respect to the CRDD's decision. Those issues were: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the CRDD err in law in concluding that Mr. Tolu had not been subjected to persecution? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the CRDD err in law by failing to consider whether cumulative harassment constituted persecution?
