If the foregoing disposes of the first issue before the Court, there is left the matter of the deemed value of the property which the Crown, in its assessed, fixed at $50,000. The only evidence of value is that found in an affidavit attached to the transfer document and dated May 29, 1980. The value there is fixed at $25,000 which, after the trial and after some discussions between the parties, was accepted as a proper valuation.
THE CONCLUSIONS:
