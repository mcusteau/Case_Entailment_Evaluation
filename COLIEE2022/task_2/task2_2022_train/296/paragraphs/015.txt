This observation also prompts me to note that s. 44 is not in the statute for purposes of setting a trap for the unwary taxpayer. If Parliament decrees that in some instances when a capital asset is replaced by another similar one a taxpayer may elect to follow the tax deferral route, it seems to me that for the proper application of the tax rules in future years, the Crown has before it a record of the election. Otherwise, entanglements and conflicts would result.
