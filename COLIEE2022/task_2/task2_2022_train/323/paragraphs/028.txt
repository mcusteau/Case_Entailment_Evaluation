I agree with counsel for the respondent that the test for compelling reasons is a difficult one to meet such that only a tiny minority of claimants cross this threshold. However, our paths diverge in that on the basis of the applicant's specific circumstances, the Board erred in its application of this fact based test. Sexual assault is appalling and atrocious particularly in this instance where it is used as a tool by the police against the applicant's sexual orientation. Similarly, physical assault and the form of prior persecution inflicted on the applicant were such that it was patently unreasonable for the Board to ask the applicant to return to not only his country, Argentina, but to his home city Buenos Aires, where the events took place.
