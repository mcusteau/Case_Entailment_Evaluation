In a letter dated June 16, 2003, Dr. Maria del Junco, a physician licensed in Ontario with a private family practice in Toronto, examined the applicant on June 5, 2004 in order to document evidence of the injuries the applicant alleged to have sustained when assaulted by the police in Argentina. Dr. del Junco's examination found the following:
"- small bump and deformity on the bridge of the nose consistent with a fracture of the nasal septum
- right upper arm - two vertical scars, 6 and 10 cm. long, with raised borders (keloid formation), consistent with lacerations that healed without suturing.
In summary, my findings were consistent with Mr. Gorria's account of how he received his injuries."
