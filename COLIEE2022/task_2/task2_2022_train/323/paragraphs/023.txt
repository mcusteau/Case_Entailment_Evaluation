[23]
In this particular case, the Board was called upon to determine whether subsection 108(4) of the
Act
is applicable to the applicant's particular set of circumstances, after having found that the applicant was not a refugee in need of protection because of paragraph 108(1)(e), "the reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist." This is a question of mixed fact and law and the applicable standard of review is one of correctness only where the Board has committed a pure error of law. Otherwise, the error is fact based and this Court will intervene if the Board's error is patently unreasonable.
