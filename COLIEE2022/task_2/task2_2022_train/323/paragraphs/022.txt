I must ordinarily first proceed with a pragmatic and functional analysis in order to determine the applicable standard of review in this case as required in
Dr. Q., Re
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170. However, in 2005, I had occasion to determine the applicable standard of review for subsection 108(4) and while the facts are altogether dissimilar between that case and the present matter, the principles of the pragmatic and functional analysis of this particular part of the
Act
is, I believe, of universal application. That is why, it bears reproducing the pragmatic and functional analysis, in its entirety, taken from paragraphs 14 to 19 of
Kotorri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1457; 279 F.T.R. 149; 2005 FC 1195:
"14. [...] The appropriate standard of review when dealing with this issue must be determined by the application of the four contextual factors of the pragmatic and functional approach established by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Dr. Q v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226: (1) the presence or absence of a privative clause or statutory right of appeal; (2) the expertise of the tribunal relative to that of the reviewing court on the issue in question; (3) the purpose of the legislation and the provision in particular; and (4) the nature of the question - law, fact or mixed law and fact.
"15. Firstly, the
Act
does not contain a privative clause. Yet, it is recognized that the absence of such a clause does not indicate a high standard of scrutiny where the other factors suggest a low standard (
Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
), [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982 at paragraph 30).
"16. Secondly, the intention behind subsection 108(4) of the
Act
is twofold: first, to recognize the legitimacy of the psychological hardship that would be faced by the victims of persecution were they to be returned to the country responsible for their maltreatment; and second, to protect the victims of past atrocities (James C. Hathaway,
The Law of Refugee Status
, Toronto: Butterworths, 1991, at pages 203-204). As mentioned in
Pushpanathan
, supra, at paragraph 36 where the purposes of the statute and of the decision-maker are conceived not primarily in terms of establishing rights as between parties, or as entitlements, but rather as a delicate balancing between different constituencies, then the appropriateness of court supervision diminishes. Accordingly, the purpose of this provision calls for some deference.
"17. Thirdly and fourthly, it is widely recognized that the Board's role to assess the documentary evidence and the credibility of the Applicant is part of its primary function. The Board, recognized to be a specialized tribunal, is therefore in a better position than the Court to weigh the documentary evidence in the record and the credibility of an Applicant's testimony (
R.K.L. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 162 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)). This implies a higher degree of deference (
Moreau-Bérubé v. New Brunswick (Judicial Council)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 249 at paragraph 50).
"18. In
Isacko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1128 (F.C.T.D.) (QL) at paragraph 8, the issue as to whether there are 'compelling reasons' in a given case has been considered as a question of fact (
Rasanayagam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1080 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)). It is the Board, with its expertise and experience that is best able to assess whether the Applicant falls within the ambit of the 'compelling reasons' provision (
Hassan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1994] F.C.J. No. 630 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)). Questions of fact are recognized to imply more deference. However, the delineation of the concept of 'compelling reasons' is a question of law for which the Board has no specific expertise.
"19. Balancing all of these factors, it is my opinion that questions of fact should be reviewed only if patently unreasonable. On the other hand, the standard of review for question of law is correctness."
