In particular, the applicant claimed that because he is a homosexual, he was stopped by police officers in Buenos Aires, on two separate occasions and was sexually and physically assaulted as follows:
a) In May 1998, while walking home after a night at a gay bar, the applicant was detained under a false pretext by the police and taken to the Comisaria 39 police station. There, he was placed in a cell by himself. Later, he was beaten up by three police officers, to such an extent that they broke his nose. They then forced him to perform oral sex on two officers while the third officer watched. When the sexual assault ended, the officers told him that he was lucky he was being allowed to leave and if he told anyone about what had transpired, they would kill him.
b) In the early hours of July 14, 2002, the applicant was stopped by different police officers who asked to see his identification documents. One of the police officers asked if the documents identified him as a "fagot." He was then arrested, shoved into the police car, where he was insulted and driven to a deserted industrial site. There, he was thrown out of the car and asked to strip naked, between barrages of insults. The officers then physically abused him, and in particular, one officer held him down while another punched him in the face and took a piece of broken glass and sliced into his right upper arm leaving two gaping vertical wounds, each approximately 6 cm and 10 cm long. The police officers left the applicant lying and bleeding on the ground, warning him to pretend that nothing happened to him. He should never tell anyone about the incident or they would retaliate against him.
