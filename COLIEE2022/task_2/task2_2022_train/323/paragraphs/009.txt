The applicant's refugee claim was dismissed by the Board on April 24, 2004. However, this decision was quashed in a judicial application, in an Order rendered by Justice Sean Harrington on June 14, 2005. The matter was remitted back to the Board for re-determination before a differently constituted panel. The newly constituted panel in turn dismissed the applicant's claim on May 12, 2006. It is this second rejection, which forms the basis of the present application for judicial review.
