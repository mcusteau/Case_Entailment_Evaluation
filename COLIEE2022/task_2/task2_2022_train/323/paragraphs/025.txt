For its part, counsel for the respondent argues that this was not a case in which the Board was required to consider compelling reasons because the applicant has not ceased to be a refugee because
he was never previously found to be a refugee
(emphasis in the original). In particular, counsel for the respondent relies on a series of cases for the proposition that the panel is obliged to consider subsection 108(4)
only
(emphasis in the original) after finding that a claimant was at one time a Convention refugee but then ceased to be so. These cases include:
Hassan v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1992), 147 N.R. 317 (F.C.A.);
Minister of Employment and Immigration v. Obstoj
, [1992] 2 F.C. 739; 142 N.R. 81 (F.C.A.),
Cihal v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 577; 257 N.R. 62 (F.C.A.) at para. 20;
Kudar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 373; 2004 FC 648 and
Naivelt et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 758; 2004 FC 1261, at para. 37.
