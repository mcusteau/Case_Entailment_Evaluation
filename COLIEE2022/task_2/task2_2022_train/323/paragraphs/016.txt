Before addressing the issue of the Board's finding of state protection in Buenos Aires, it is necessary to address the bipartite test the claimant must meet in order to establish a well-founded fear of persecution. This test is set out by the Supreme Court of Canada at paragraphs 47 and 52 of
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321. The relevant portions are as follows:
"47. More generally, what exactly must a claimant do to establish fear of persecution? As has been alluded to above, the test is bipartite: (1) the claimant must subjectively fear persecution; and (2) this fear must be well-founded in an objective sense. This test was articulated and applied by Heald, J.A., in
Rajudeen
, supra, at p. 134:
'The subjective component relates to the existence of the fear of persecution in the mind of the refugee. The objective component requires that the refugee's fear be evaluated objectively to determine if there is a valid basis for that fear.'

(1989), 99 N.R. 171 (F.C.A.), at p. 173. [...]
"52. In summary, I find that state complicity is not a necessary component of persecution, either under the 'unwilling' or under the 'unable' branch of the definition. A subjective fear of persecution combined with state inability to protect the claimant creates a presumption that the fear is well-founded. [...]."
