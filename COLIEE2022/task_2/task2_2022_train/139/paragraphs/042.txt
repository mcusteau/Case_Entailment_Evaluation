  Moreover, the circumstances in which the representations were said to have been made were described as follows by the Applicant in her cross-examination (Transcript of Applicant's cross-examination of March 1, 2010, at pages 7-8): 
 
 
 
 Q. And now -- and we all know that one of the key issues that -- in your application is that you've said that you felt when you left the interview that you were going to be granted an H&C exemption. You thought that you were going to have a positive decision. Is that correct? 
 
 
 
 A. Yes. 
 
 
 
 Q. What's that based on? 
 
 
 
 A. On the officer in the way she referred to us and to -- when I actually would say bye to each other and we shook hands, she told me to not worry, enjoy being a mother. And somebody say that to you when you are in this kind of process, I believe it's like assuring you that you're going to have a positive answer because if I don't have to worry about my immigration situation, I can really enjoy to be a mom. 
 
 
 
 If I can't assure myself that I'm going to be here, I need to plan what is going to happen with me and my daughter --- 
 
 
 
 Q. Right. 
 
 
 
 A. --- because I gotta take that and get read [ 
 sic 
 ] for everything. So yeah. 
 
 
 
 Q. But you'd agree with me that Ms. Gallant didn't actually say, "Don't worry about your immigration situation" or "Don't worry about your application"? 
 
 
 
 A. No, but she, she say, "Do not worry. Everything's going to be fine. And don't worry and enjoy being a mother". 
 
 
 
 Q. And your understanding from that was that she was saying it would be a positive decision. 
 
 
 
 A. Yes, I would say yes.
