  Concerning the procedural fairness argument advanced by the Applicant, the Minister asserts that it was the Applicant who was entrapping the Officer with queries as to whether additional information was required. The onus was on the Applicant to submit the information she deemed appropriate. The Applicant could not simply be relieved of this burden by asking the Officer if she needed further information. In any event, the Applicant did in fact submit all the evidence she deemed appropriate.
