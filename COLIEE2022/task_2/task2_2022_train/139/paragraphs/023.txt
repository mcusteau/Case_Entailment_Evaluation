 [23] 
  Prior to  
 Dunsmuir 
 , and pursuant to  
 Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at paras. 57 to 62, decisions involving discretionary ministerial exemptions based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations were deemed reviewable on a standard of reasonableness simpliciter. This standard has since been collapsed into a single form of reasonableness review:  
 Dunsmuir 
 , above at para. 45. Consequently, this is the standard which I shall apply in reviewing the Officer's decision: see  
 Ahmad v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 646, [2008] F.C.J. No. 814 (QL) at paras. 10 to 13.
