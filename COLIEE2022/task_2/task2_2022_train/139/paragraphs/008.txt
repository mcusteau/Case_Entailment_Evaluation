  The Applicant and Ms. Alonso insisted on having an interview with the Officer to demonstrate their close relationship, and this request was eventually granted. The interview took place on April 2, 2009. In her affidavit, the Applicant asserts that during the interview the Officer was asked if she needed further documents and she answered that none were required. The Applicant also claims the Officer told her not to worry about her H&C application and to concentrate on being a new mother. The Applicant asserts that, in reliance on those statements, she decided not to provide any new documents in support of her H&C application.
