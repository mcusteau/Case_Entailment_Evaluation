  I cannot find from these transcripts that there is an objective basis to the legitimate expectation claims of the Applicant. Perhaps the Officer was polite and kind in parting with the Applicant at the end of the interview, and had sympathy for her situation as a single, pregnant, young woman. However this is far from a situation where a commitment to issuing a positive decision was made.
