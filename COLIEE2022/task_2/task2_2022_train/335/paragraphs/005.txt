On February 23, 2004, the tribunal dismissed the applicant's claim because of her lack of subjective fear and lack of credibility. The tribunal who also considered the claim in light of paragraph 97(1) of the Act found that there is no trustworthy evidence that the applicant would be personally exposed to a danger of torture or a risk to her life. For the following reasons, I find the grounds of review raised by the applicant to be unsubstantiated and I see no reason to intervene or disturb the tribunal's decision.
