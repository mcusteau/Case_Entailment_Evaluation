It has been well established that, with respect to credibility and assessment of evidence, this Court may not substitute its decision for that of the tribunal's when the applicant has failed to prove that the tribunal's decision was based on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or that the decision was made without regard for the material before it (See Akinlolu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 296 (F.C.T.D.) (QL) at para. 14; and the grounds for review at subsection 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act, R.C.S., 1985, c. F-7. Furthermore, the tribunal is entitled to consider the testimonial and documentary evidence as a whole in order to determine how much weight it should be accorded (Mostajelin v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 28 (F.C.A.) (QL). Therefore, if the tribunal finds that the applicant's allegation lacked credibility, it can also consider that the evidence submitted by the applicant should be given little weight.
