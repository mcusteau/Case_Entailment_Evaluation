The applicant further argues that the tribunal made a reviewable error when it failed to consider the Gender Guidelines in its decision. This Court believes that the tribunal implicitly considered the Gender Guidelines in its decision, although it did not expressly state so in its reasons. Furthermore, this Court finds that the tribunal's failure to mention the Gender Guidelines has no bearing on the issue of this case since its key findings relate to the applicant lack of subjective fear and of credibility. Moreover, the tribunal is not bound by the Gender Guidelines: (Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 4 F.C. 358 (FCA) (QL); Hazarat v. Canada (Secretary of State), [1994] F.C.J. No. 1774 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)). Furthermore, this Court finds that the decision Griffith v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1142 (F.C.T.D.) (QL) is not applicable to the case at bar. In Griffith, supra, the Court's decision to quash the tribunal's decision was based on the fact that the analysis required to make a proper finding of credibility was not made and that the tribunal did not disclose the degree of knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity required in assessing the actions of a woman subjected to domestic violence. Such elements are not found in the case at bar. Therefore, this Court's believes that Griffith, supra, is not relevant to this case and that the tribunal did not make a reviewable error when it did not mention the Gender Guidelines in its decision.
