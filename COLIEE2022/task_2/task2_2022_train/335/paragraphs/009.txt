Indeed, it is well established that a general lack of credibility of the applicant can affect all relevant evidence submitted by the applicant and ultimately cause the rejection of her claim. On this matter, in Sheikh v. Canada, [1990] 3 F.C. 238 (C.A.) (QL) the Federal Court of Appeal held that:
"I would add that in my view, even without disbelieving every word an applicant has uttered, a first-level panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim on which a second-level panel could uphold that claim. In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony."
