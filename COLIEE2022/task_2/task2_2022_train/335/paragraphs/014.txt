In the case at bar, the tribunal was well founded to take into account the fact that the applicant's refugee claim was made after an unusually long delay of nearly five years after she first came to Canada. In connection with this, the tribunal found that the applicant failed to provide satisfactory explanations for the delay. This Court has already established that such a delay and lack of satisfactory explanation can be fatal to an applicant's claim. Mr. Justice Rouleau held in Espinosa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1680 (F.C.T.D.) (QL) that:
"The Board states correctly that while the delay is generally not a determinative factor in a refugee claim, there are circumstances where the delay can be such that it assumes a decisive role; what is fatal to the applicant's claim is his inability to provide any satisfactory explanation for the delay."
