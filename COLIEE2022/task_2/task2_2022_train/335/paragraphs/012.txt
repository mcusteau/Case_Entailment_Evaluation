The applicant submits that the standard to be applied is whether there is a reasonable possibility that she may face persecution, torture and inhumane treatment; however in order to meet the definition of a "Convention Refugee", the applicant must show that she meets the various parts of that definition beginning with subjective and objective fear of persecution. In Kamana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1695 (TD)(QL), at paragraph 10, Justice Tremblay-Lamer stated:
"The lack of evidence going to the subjective element of the claim is a fatal flaw which in and of itself warrants dismissal of the claim, since both elements of the refugee definition - subjective and objective - must be met."
