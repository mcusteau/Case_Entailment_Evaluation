Counsel for the defendant puts it this way:
"The market share figures were also admitted by Mr. Fernstr√∂m to be for a small subdivision of the boom market for the area where the product can be used and nothing else. The market share figures are therefore completely irrelevant to commercial success. They do not apply to mining such as the Denison job, which is the infringement complained of in Canada."
I agree.
