The defendant is correct. At the time when the Swedish and Canadian applications were filed, that is, as late as the filing of the Canadian application on November 3, 1967, the use of hydraulic locks, was not considered to be an important aspect of the invention. Not only were they only mentioned in passing in page 3 of the disclosure, but they were not claimed in the broad claims either of the Swedish or Canadian applications. Would a person, skilled in the art, upon examining the patent description and claims, be able to determine what hydraulic locks are, and what their function is? Clearly not, nor in my view did the plaintiff so intend when making its application for patent.
