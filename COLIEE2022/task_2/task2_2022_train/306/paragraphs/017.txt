Mr. G. Fernstr√∂m is the Managing Director and President of Berema A.B., a company in the Atlas Copco group. Atlas Copco we learned is a company which started over 110 years ago making mining and construction equipment. He stated:
"It was part of my responsibility to be aware of the technical state of the art in terms of what was being offered on the market by our competitors, what was being discussed in technical literature, and what was going on within Atlas Copco. It was also part of my responsibility to be aware of operative limitations of the equipment sold by Atlas Copco and of the equipment sold by their competitors and, on specific assignments, to consult in the field with users of Atlas Copco equipment prototypes with a view to improving performance of the equipment in the application which it was being applied."
