Dr. Lundquist also had something to say which was categorically different than the stance taken by Mr. Fernstr√∂m.
"Q.	Have you had occasion to observe booms with base rotation and cartesian booms?
A.	Yes. I have observed booms with both base rotation and cartesian positioning which had hydraulic parallel on them.
Q.	And, in your view, are there any significant differences between them?
A.	There is certainly no difference in result; that is to say, both are about equally convenient to use, both take about the same amount of time to position and both would, therefore, seem to me to be equally productive."
