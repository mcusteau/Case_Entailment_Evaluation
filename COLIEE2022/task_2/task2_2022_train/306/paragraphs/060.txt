Mr. Fernstr√∂m's evidence-in-chief indicates earlier patents had nothing to teach, there was no obviousness or prior art, that the patent provided significant advantages, resulted in commercial success for the plaintiff and drove some companies out of business. It is not surprising therefore that the plaintiff sought and secured a patent for parallel holding. Dr. Fox provides the basis for the determination I now have to make:
"Any question involving presence or absence of invention is a matter of fact, to be arrived at after due consideration of the state of public knowledge at the date of the patent."
