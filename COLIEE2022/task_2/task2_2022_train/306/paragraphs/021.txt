It was the further evidence of Mr. Fernstr√∂m that the two patents in suit for parallel holding and rollover rotation substantially improved the tunnel drilling/blasting state of the art resulting in more efficient tunnel driving. He states:
"(1) Parallel holding gives more accurate parallel holes in the cut, decreasing the risk of drilling into other holes which destroys blasting effectiveness.
"(2) Secondly Parallel holding speeded up movements between holes (fewer controls to handle) and assured parallelity between the holes, producing full blasting depth."
