Dr. Fox, in his 4th edition at page 78 says:
"Then, too commercial success may be explained by many factors and reasons having little, if anything to do with the presence of inventive genius. These factors may be such as low cost price, mere novelty, commercial enterprise, the creation of a new demand by style or fashion trends, the mere production of a superior article by better workmanship with nothing of an inventive nature involved, or by improvements subsequent to the date of the patent."
