And then finally, at pages 79-80 of the evidence:
"Very quick movements [the driller does it very easily] as only the feed is rotated ... the difference of having the rotation in the feed holder parallel up in the front of the feed is that you rotate only the feed of 500 or 600 kilos and that is a rotation of 180 degrees. That only takes 10 or 15 seconds to rotate the boom around. Other competitive booms have had the rotation in the rear end where you have to rotate two or three tons, 2000 or 3000 kilos and that is much more clumsy. It takes maybe half a minute or up to one minute to rotate."
And later at page 81:
"Lookout holes can be quickly set up, and after drilling when the look-out angle is removed, the drill is automatically returned to parallelity with the previous parallel holes."
