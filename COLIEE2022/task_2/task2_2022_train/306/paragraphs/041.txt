Mr. J. Rinfret in Christiana and Nielsen v. Rice, [1930] S.C.R. 443, at page 456 states:
"The holding therefore, is that by the date of discovery of the invention is meant the date at which the inventor can prove he has first formulated either in writing or verbally a description which affords the means of making that which is invented."
