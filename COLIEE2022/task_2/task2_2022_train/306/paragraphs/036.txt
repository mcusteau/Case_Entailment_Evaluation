As a result of a competition initiated by his chief ("whereby a hydraulic boom should be prepared or designed. The best solution would be used as BUX 56 design") the witness "came on the idea that we have a parallel steering boom, and I proposed this on a sketch." From the evidence at page 516, Mr. Kimber seems to suggest that he drew a sketch of his idea, then another sketch to discuss with Mr. Rönne of the Hydraulic Department and then at Mr. Rönne's suggestion he made a "complete mechancial design so that the precise geometry was presented and after that we would discuss the precise solution".
