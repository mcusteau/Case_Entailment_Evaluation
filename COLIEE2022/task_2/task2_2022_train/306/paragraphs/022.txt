Mr. Fernstr√∂m maintained the parallel keeping system and the rollover, where only the V-cut was possible to utilize before, is "titled Cartesian booms where you swing and lift the booms. It means that when you go from one hole to another you only have to utilize
the rear end cylinders for lifting the boom and swinging the boom
, and with this
parallel-keeping system
, the feed will always stay parallel to the first hole drilled." (Underlining is mine).
