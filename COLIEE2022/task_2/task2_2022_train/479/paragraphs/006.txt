At the joint inquiry, counsel for the applicant asked the adjudicator to exercise his discretion under rule 6(3) of the
Adjudication Division Rules
to sever the applicant's inquiry on the basis that an injustice would be likely if the two inquiries remained joined. The adjudicator declined to separate the inquiries and, from a review of the transcript, appears to have refused the request primarily on the basis that he could see no prejudice to the wife in having her inquiry proceed jointly with her husband's inquiry.
