In Court File IMM-346-95, which is before me, the applicant seeks judicial review of the adjudicator's refusal to sever her inquiry from her husband's inquiry. This is the application for leave which is the basis for the motion the stay of the departure order. Accordingly, it will be the adjudicator's refusal to sever the applicant's inquiry which will be the focus of any comments I may make about whether the application for leave raised a serious issue.
