Given my conclusion on the issue of irreparable harm, I do not propose to decide the question of a serious issue. I only wish to note that it became clear during argument that the matter which the applicant now says is the serious issue is not clearly defined in the application for leave and judicial review. It is also possible that the issue that the applicant now raises was not squarely raised before the adjudicator.
