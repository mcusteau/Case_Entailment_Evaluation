  Mr. Navarrete had very limited knowledge of Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus' former common-law relationship. He did not know the name of the three children's biological father (Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus' former common-law partner). His evidence was vague concerning why Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus' relationship with her former partner broke down. He was unable to provide any information as to whether Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus was ever hospitalised as a result of abuse from her former common-law partner. Finally, Mr. Navarrete did not know when Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus last saw her former common-law partner.
