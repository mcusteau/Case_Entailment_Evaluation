  The test pursuant to subsection 4(3) of the former  
 Regulations 
  is a two-part test which was discussed by Justice Michel Beaudry in  
 Sanichara 
  above, at paras. 14-15: 
 
 
 
 "... Section 4(3) used to establish a two-prong test in order for a spouse to be disqualified as a member of the family class. In order for a spouse to be disqualified it must be demonstrated that (1) the spouse entered into the marriage primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada as a member of the family class; and (2) it was not with the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse: 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "This two-stage test for disqualifying a spouse as a member of the family class was reiterated in  
 Horbas v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1985] 2 F.C. 359 (T.D.), wherein Strayer, J., as he then was, stated: 
 
 
 
 'It should first be observed that the test is a double test: that is, the spouse is disqualified under subsection 4(3) only if the marriage is entered into primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada and not with the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 'It must be kept in mind that in order to reject such an application on the basis of this subsection, it must be found that there is both a marriage entered into by the sponsored spouse primarily for purposes of immigration and lack of intention on his or her part to live permanently with the other spouse.'"
