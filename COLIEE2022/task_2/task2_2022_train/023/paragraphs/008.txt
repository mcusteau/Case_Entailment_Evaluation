  The Visa Office received anonymous information that Mr. Navarrete is the common law husband of Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus' sister, Ms. Gleidys De Jesus, and that Ms. Gleidys De Jesus married Mr. Jose Abel Felipe in the Dominican Republic on the same day as Mr. Navarrete married Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus. The information also indicated that Mr. Felipe applied to immigrate to Canada and did not report his criminal record which included a conviction for rape. Mr. Felipe's sister is Ms. Marisol Felipe who is married to Mr. Michael Campbell. They work at an immigration consulting firm, Immigration Assistance Centre, which was used by both Mr. Felipe and Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus and their sponsors (Mr. Navarrete and Ms. Gleidys De Jesus). Mr. Felipe's application for permanent residence was ultimately refused. Ms. Gleidys De Jesus filed a sponsorship appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division, but this appeal was declared abandoned on September 9, 2003.
