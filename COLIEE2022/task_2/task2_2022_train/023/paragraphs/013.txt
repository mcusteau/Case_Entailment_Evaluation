  At the appeal, the IAD found that Mr. Navarrete had discharged the onus to show that he was not subject to subsection 4(3) of the former Regulations. It concluded that the marriage was not entered into primarily for Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus to gain admission to Canada and that Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus did intend to reside permanently with Mr. Navarrete as his spouse. Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus was found to be a member of the family class. The appeal was therefore allowed.
