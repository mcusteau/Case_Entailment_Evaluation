The sole question to be determined is whether the word "shall" in s. 16.1(2) of the Regulations above mentioned is imperative or directory. Should it be imperative, then the Parole Board will have lost all jurisdiction to hear the case and the applicant will be entitled as of right to be released on parole on the 11th of March, 1990.
