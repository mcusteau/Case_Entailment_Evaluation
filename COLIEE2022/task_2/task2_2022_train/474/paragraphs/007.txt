In the decision of the Privy Council in Montreal Street Railway v. Normandin, [1917] A.C. 170 (P.C.), we find the following statement of law by Sir Arthur Channell at pages 174 and 175 of the report:
"The statutes contain no enactment as to what is to be the consequence of nonobservance of these provisions. It is contended for the appellants that the consequence is that the trial was coram non judice and must be treated as a nullity.
"It is necessary to consider the principles which have been adopted in construing statutes of this character, and the authorities so far as there are any on the particular question arising here. The question whether provisions in a statute are directory or imperative has very frequently arisen in this country, but it has been said that no general rule can be laid down, and that in every case the object of the statute must be looked at. The cases on the subject will be found collected in Maxwell on Statutes, 5th Ed., p. 596, and following pages. When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience, or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty, and at the same time would not promote the main object of the Legislature, it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only, the neglect of them, though punishable, not affecting the validity of the acts done."
