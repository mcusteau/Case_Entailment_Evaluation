These provisions, along with several other sections in the Act, were added as part of an amendment to the Parole Act enacted in 1986. There is no dispute that the applicant was properly sentenced pursuant to an offence which was prosecuted by indictment and which caused serious harm to another person. Therefore, the sole matter to be determined by the Parole Board would be that raised in s. 21.3(2)(c) above quoted, namely whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the inmate is likely to commit, prior to the expiration of the sentence, an offence causing death or serious harm to another person.
