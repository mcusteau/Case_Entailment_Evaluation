Pinard, J.
: Under this Originating Notice of Motion the applicant is seeking a writ of prohibition, pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, estopping the National Parole Board (the "Board") from conducting a detention review hearing, pursuant to provisions of s. 130 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, S.C. 1992, c. 20, as amended (the "
Act
").
Facts
[2]
On September 19, 1990, the applicant was sentenced to a term of seven (7) years imprisonment. The applicant is presently incarcerated at the William Head Institution, Metchosin, British Columbia. The applicant's statutory release date was May 28, 1995. The applicant has a warrant expiry date of September 18, 1997 for offences, including offences set out in Schedule I being: sexual assault and sexual assault with a weapon and point firearm. Pursuant to s. 129(1) of the
Act
:
"Before the statutory release date of an offender who is serving a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more that includes a sentence imposed for an offence set out in Schedule I or II that was prosecuted by way of indictment, the Commissioner shall cause the offender's case to be reviewed by the Service."
[3]
The Correction Service of Canada (the "Service") completed a review of the applicant's case on October 14, 1994 by completing a document titled Progress Summary Report. The Service shared the Progress Summary Report with the applicant on November 2, 1994. On page 9 of the Progress Summary Report it was noted that "[t]his report was shared with Jerry Baker on 1994-11-02 by D. Murray, A/CMO". Subsection 129(2) of the
Act
sets out that:
"After the review of the case of an offender pursuant to subsection (1), and not later than six months before the statutory release date, the Service shall refer the case to the Board together with all the information that, in its opinion, is relevant to it, where the Service is of the opinion
(a) in the case of an offender serving a term of imprisonment that includes a sentence for an offence set out in Schedule I, that
(i) the commission of the offence caused the death of or serious harm to another person, and
(ii) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the offender is likely to commit an offence causing death or serious harm to another person before the expiration of the offender's sentence according to law; or"
[4]
The Board received the referral from the Service on November 7, 1994 (being more than six months before the applicant's statutory release date of May 28, 1995). Pursuant to s. 130(1) of the
Act
:
"Where the case of an offender is referred to the Board by the Service pursuant to subsection 129(2) or referred to the Chairperson of the Board by the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 129(3), the Board shall, subject to subsections 129(5), (6) and (7), at the times and in the manner prescribed by the regulations,
(a) inform the offender of the referral and review, and
(b) review the case,
and the Board shall cause all such inquiries to be conducted in connection with the review as it considers necessary."
[5]
Pursuant to s. 160(1)(a)(i) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations
, SOR/92-620 (the "
Regulations
"):
"Where the case of an offender is referred to the Board pursuant to subsection 129(2) of the Act or to the Chairperson of the Board pursuant to subsection 129(3) of the Act, the Board shall inform the offender, in writing, of
(a) the referral
(i) five months before the offender's date for statutory release, where the case is referred to the Board or to the Chairperson of the Board not later than six months before that date, or"
[6]
As the applicant's statutory release date was May 28, 1995, the Board ought to have informed the applicant, in writing, of the Service referral by December 28, 1994. On February 7, 1995, and again on February 18, 1995, the applicant received letters notifying him that the Board would conduct a detention review hearing with him on March 10, 1995. This was three months and three weeks before the applicant's statutory release date rather than the five-month notice as set out in s. 160(1)(a)(i) of the
Regulations
.
[7]
Pursuant to s. 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
:
"A review of the case of an offender by the Board pursuant to subsection 130(1) of the Act shall be held
(a) not later than three months before the offender's date for statutory release, where the case of the offender has been referred to the Board or to the Chairperson of the Board at least four months before that date; or"
[8]
The Board scheduled the applicant's detention review for March 10, 1995, being two months and three weeks before the applicant's statutory release date, instead of three months before the applicant's statutory release date as contemplated in s. 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
. By letter dated February 7, 1995, and again by letter dated February 18, 1995, the Board informed the applicant that his detention review hearing was scheduled for March 10, 1995.
[9]
When Michael Halko, the Regional Manager, Conditional Release Programs, of the Pacific Region Board was made aware that the Board had not complied with subparagraph 160(1)(a)(i) and paragraph 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
, it was too late to meet the time requirements set out in those provisions. Mr. Halko made the conscious and deliberate decision to maintain the March 10, 1995, detention review hearing as he concluded that there would be a great prejudice to the protection of society if the Board did not conduct that hearing. Mr. Halko concluded that there would be minor prejudice to the applicant if the hearing proceeded on March 10 for several reasons: the applicant had had enough notice to prepare his case; all the information had been provided to the applicant; and, as the applicant's statutory release date was May 28, 1995, the hearing could proceed on March 10 and, if ordered released at that hearing, the applicant would not be held in custody for any time after his release date.
[10]
In order to allow the court to hear the applicant's application for a writ of prohibition estopping the Board from conducting a detention review hearing, the applicant has requested adjournments of the detention review hearing until the conclusion of this judicial review application, resulting in the applicant remaining in custody past his statutory release date.
Issues
[11]
The main issue in this matter is whether an order of prohibition should issue estopping a detention review hearing due to the fact that the Board missed the statutory notice provisions due to the applicant as set out under the
Act
.
[12]
Before dealing with the latter issue, I would like first to dispose of a preliminary issue which was raised by the applicant with respect to the admissibility of portions of the respondent's supporting affidavits. The applicant submits in that regard that parts of the affidavits of Michael Halko and Mary Campbell should be struck and not admitted as evidence at the judicial review hearing. The applicant relies on prior submissions made before Madame Justice Reed, on September 18, 1995. In her Reasons in support of an Order dismissing the applicant's motion to strike paragraphs 3, 6-9 and 18-30 of the affidavit of Mr. Halko, and paragraph 3 of the affidavit of Ms. Campbell, Madame Justice Reed stated the following:
"... I am not persuaded the material is so irrelevant that it must be struck out. Exhibit A to Mr. Halko's affidavit is not only relevant it is crucial to the Respondent's argument. As such it should be part of the record in its entirety. In addition, while the material, to which objection is made, clearly does not put the applicant in a very good light, it is relevant to whether or not a valid referral was made and at what date that occurred. Part of it is also relevant to the determination of prejudice which Mr. Justice MacKay indicated in
Kennedy v. National Parole Board
(1991), 4 F.T.R. 55, is a relevant factor.
"I have reached the conclusion that the relevance of the disputed material is a matter more appropriately left to the Trial Judge who hears the application on the merits.
"With respect to those portions of the affidavits which allegedly express opinions and conclusions of law, I have no doubt that the judge hearing the application on the merits will ignore those portions which fall into that category. I am not persuaded that there is any good reason why they should be struck out at this stage."
[13]
On review of the paragraphs in the challenged affidavits, which incidentally are not contradicted by any other evidence, it is my opinion that they basically relate to the personal experiences (i.e. work experience) of the affiants and that, therefore, they are relevant. As to the material to which objection is made, I adopt the words used by Madame Justice Reed in the first paragraph of the above abstract from her Reasons for Order and Order. On the issue of conclusions of law, it can be said, again, that these deal with the affiant Halko's experience with the laws he deals with in his job, and not necessarily conclusions of law. It should be pointed out that Mr. Halko is the Regional Manager of the Conditional Release Programs, that he oversees the Board's staff who schedule hearings to be conducted by members of the Pacific Region of the Board and that he makes decisions on the scheduling of hearings to be conducted by the latter members of the Board. Paragraph 8 of his affidavit simply acknowledges the provisions of a section of the
Regulations
. Sections 18-20 deal with his conclusions with respect to the applicant's conditional release being a threat to society and his review of the criteria to be reviewed pursuant to s. 101 of the
Act
. With respect with Ms. Campbell's affidavit, she states that, as a drafter of the legislation in question (the precursor sections to ss. 129 and 130 of the
Act
and s. 160 of the
Regulations
) it is her
"best recollection that the intention behind [. . .] s. 160 [. . .] is to ensure that the offender has sufficient time to allow all processes to be completed prior to the statutory release date of that offender. This includes ensuring that, subsequent to the decision, there is time for the offender to complete any avenues of recourse before the statutory release date of the offender."
[14]
In my view, this particular type of information can be subsumed into the numerous cases which deal with any prejudice an inmate might suffer if statutorily outlined notice dates are not followed. Consequently, the challenged affidavits are accepted as filed and admitted as evidence.
[15]
With respect to the main issue, the applicant submits that:
1.	the provisions of s. 160(1)(a) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations
impose a statutory duty upon the Board, to inform the inmate, in writing, five (5) months before his statutory release date, that his case had been referred to the Board for a detention review hearing;
2.	the provisions of s. 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
impose a statutory duty upon the Board to hold the detention review hearing not less than three (3) months before the inmate's statutory release date;
3.	the Board failed to give the applicant written notice and failed to conduct the detention review hearing as mandated by the
Regulations
;
4.	the Board's failure to fulfil its statutory duties violates the applicant's fundamental right to fair treatment, as guaranteed by s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part I of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, which is Schedule B of the
Canada Act 1982
(U.K.), 1982, c. 11;
5.	the Board's failure to fulfil its statutory duties constitutes a jurisdictional error; and
6.	the appropriate remedy is a writ of prohibition, pursuant to the provisions of s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, estopping the Board from conducting a detention review hearing, pursuant to the provisions of s. 130 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, in relation to the applicant.
Analysis
[16]
In my view, while s. 160(1)(a)(i) and s. 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
were not complied with, the applicant was not prejudiced by the non-compliance as he had all relevant information and adequate time to prepare himself for the hearing.
[17]
In
Cleary v. Correctional Service of Canada et al.
(1990), 108 N.R. 225; 56 C.C.C.(3d) 157, the Federal Court of Appeal found that while the legislative provisions containing the word "shall" are imperative, the court's granting of an order for certiorari is discretionary. While an inmate's procedural safeguards were breached by the Service, the court found that the applicant had suffered no prejudice and an order for certiorari should not issue. In that case, Chief Justice Iacobucci, as he then was, focused on then s. 17 of the now repealed
Parole Regulations
(now s. 141(1) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
) wherein information to be considered by the Board at the hearing had to be provided to the offender at least fifteen days before that hearing. Chief Justice Iacobucci said, at pages 159 and 160:
"... What is relevant is that the decision involved is of importance to the appellant and has serious consequences to him. Moreover, there is little conviction in the 'mandatory-directory' dichotomy to answer the question before us. At bottom what we are seeking is legislative intention. According to the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, s. 11, 'shall' is to be construed as imperative. But whether failure to comply with a command entails nullity, and if so to what extent, surely depends on the legislative scheme as a whole.
"In this case, we are of the view that the requirement of 15 days' notice to the appellant was clearly intended to allow him a minimum period of time to examine the information that the Board proposed to consider and to meet the case against him. In looking at the notice provision in the context of the
Parole Act
and
Regulations
, as a whole, and the importance of the subject-matter of the hearing before the Parole Board and its consequences to the appellant, we have no doubt that the time frames in question were intended to be, and are in fact, imperative. So without more, the appellant would be entitled to certiorari.
"However, it is well established that the granting of certiorari is discretionary. As the appellant has conceded that the time frame that was actually observed herein was sufficient for him to prepare his case and that the Board offered to adjourn if he required more time, we are of the view that this is a case where the Trial Division ought to have exercised its discretion to refuse to grant certiorari because no prejudice has been suffered."
[18]
In
Kennedy v. National Parole Board
(1991), 47 F.T.R. 55 (T.D.), my colleague Mr. Justice MacKay dealt with a request for a writ of prohibition. In that case, the Board did not conduct a detention review hearing within the thirteen weeks before the presumptive release date as required by the then s. 16(2) of the now repealed
Parole Regulations
(now s. 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
). Mr. Justice MacKay reviewed the relevant case law and determined, at page 61, that while the Board no longer had time to conduct its review process within the regulated time frame,
"... as the Court in Appeal indicated in
Cleary
, whether the Court should intervene by grant of an extraordinary discretionary remedy such as prohibition, here sought, does not automatically follow. Where the statute and
Regulations
provide no consequences of any kind that would follow nonconformance with the provision requiring a hearing to be held at least thirteen weeks before the presumptive release date one must look to the general object and purposes of the legislation."
[19]
Mr. Justice MacKay determined that, while the applicant had not been given proper procedural notice, no serious issues of fairness to the applicant were raised and accordingly, a writ of prohibition estopping the Board from proceeding with the hearing would not be issued.
[20]
In
Reddecliff v. Warden of Mountain Institution and National Parole Board
(13 September 1990), Vancouver Registry No. CC901225 (B.C.S.C.), as in the case at bar, through its own inadvertence, the Board did not notify the offender, in writing, of the referral to it by the Service at least five months before his presumptive release date under then s. 16.1(1)(a)(i) of the now repealed
Parole Regulations
(now s. 160(1)(a)(i) of the
Regulations
), and the detention review hearing was not conducted thirteen weeks before the presumptive release date under then s. 16.1(2)(a) of the now repealed
Parole Regulations
(now 3 months before the statutory release date pursuant to paragraph 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
). With regard to the Board not informing Reddecliff of the referral, in writing, within five months of his presumptive release date, Mr. Justice Shaw stated at page 9:
"In my view, in substance, Mr. Reddecliff was informed of the referral to the Board when he was given the progress summary on February 27, 1990, and it was reviewed with him by Service staff. As I said earlier, the implication of this report could not have been lost on him."
[21]
More recently, in
Fragoso v. National Parole Board
(1995), 101 F.T.R. 131 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Richard, in support of a decision dismissing an application for judicial review in respect of a decision of the National Parole Board, stated the following at pages 7 and 8:
"While the Board itself did not advise the applicant directly 5 months prior to the applicant's statutory release date, or on or before September 1, 1994 of the referral and review of his case, the applicant was advised by the CSC in January 1994 of the referral decision. Moreover, the Board provided the applicant with notice of the date of his detention hearing and the materials to be relied upon by the Board on September 26, 1995, 25 days after the expiration of the 5-month period under paragraph 160(1)(a) of the
CCRR
, as soon as practicable after the date of the applicant's review hearing had been set by the Board pursuant to paragraph 160(1)(b) of the
CCRR
, and well before the 15-day period prescribed by s. 141 of the
CCRA
for providing the applicant with the information that is to be considered in the review of his case. There is no evidence of bad faith or arbitrariness.
"No prejudice has been suffered by the applicant as a result of any failure on the part of the Board to comply with the time frame set out in paragraph 160(1)(a) of the
CCRR
. The applicant was aware of the referral to the Board since January 1994, was provided with notice of his hearing and the information to be relied upon by the Board well in advance of his review hearing, and has not demonstrated that he lacked sufficient time to prepare his case or to meet the case against him.
"The Court must also weigh the importance of the public interest in ensuring that detention reviews are conducted prior to the statutory release of offenders, the history and serious nature of the offenses committed by the applicant, and the technical nature of any failure on the part of the Board to comply with the time period in this case."
[22]
When taking the principles set out in
Cleary
,
Kennedy
,
Reddecliff
and
Fragoso
together, it is clear that noncompliance with s. 160(1)(a)(i) and s. 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
does not automatically result in entitlement to the granting of a writ of prohibition prohibiting the Board from conducting a detention review hearing. Instead, the jurisprudence shows that first the object, purpose and intention of the legislative scheme as a whole must be examined. Second, a determination must be made whether the process of the Board violated basic principles of fairness or natural justice or otherwise seriously prejudiced the offender concerned to a degree warranting the granting of extraordinary relief.
[23]
In determining the object, purpose and intention of the relevant legislative scheme as a whole, I agree with Mr. Justice Addy, in
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, that the general object and purpose of the
Act
is to benefit the prisoner but is mainly to protect the public from the possible consequences of the release into society of a very dangerous criminal. Judge Addy stated the following at FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
[24]
In addition, it seems obvious that the intention behind the structure of s. 160 of the
Regulations
, as stated in the affidavit of Mary Campbell, is to ensure that the offender has sufficient time to allow all processes to be completed prior to his or her statutory release date, including, allowing time subsequent to the Board's decision for the offender to complete any avenues of recourse before his or her statutory release date.
[25]
Indeed, the respondent did not give the full five-month formal written notice pursuant to s. 160(1)(a)(i) to the applicant of the referral from the Service to the Board. Rather, the applicant received three months and three weeks formal written notice. However, the applicant knew of the possibility of a detention referral from the date of his conviction on September 19, 1990 as some of the offences he was convicted of were offences set out in Schedule I. In addition, the applicant knew of the referral by the Service from November 2, 1994 when he was provided with a copy of the referral document by the Service. Further, on February 3, 1995, the applicant was provided with a copy of a psychological/psychiatric assessment report prepared for use at the detention review hearing, again confirming to the applicant that his case had been referred to the Board by the Service. Also, the Board scheduled, through a mistake of their own admittance, the detention review hearing two months and three weeks before the applicant's statutory release date. This was only one week short of the statutory three-month period prescribed by s. 160(2)(a) of the
Regulations
. Under such circumstances, I find that while the applicant had shortened notice periods, he was not prejudiced in any way.
[26]
Consequently, it being quite clear from the provisions of the
Act
that the conditional release of an offender has to be balanced against victims' rights and the protection of society, I find, in this case, that the applicant's rights were infringed minimally and that a writ of prohibition against a detention review hearing should not be issued. While the respondent admits having breached two notice provisions of the
Act
, the applicant had time to prepare his defence and has not been prejudiced. There have been no serious breaches of natural justice and/or procedural fairness, which should override the intentions of the
Act
. The application, therefore, is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
