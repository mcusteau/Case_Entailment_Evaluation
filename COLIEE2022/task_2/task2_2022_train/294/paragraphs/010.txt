The Respondent relies on
De La Cruz v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1989), 26 F.T.R. 285 (T.D.), where the Court held that the issuance of a visitor's visa is a discretionary one and an applicant bears the burden of showing that their continuing presence in Canada is not contrary to the statutory or regulatory schemes. The Respondent says that here, sections 20(1), 22(1), 22(2) and 26 of the
Act
apply, as well as sections 63, 179, 182 and 183(1) to (4) of the
Regulations
