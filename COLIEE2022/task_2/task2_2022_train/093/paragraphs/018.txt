  In  
 Harb v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration) 
 , [2003] F.C.J. No. 108; 302 N.R. 178; 2003 FCA 39, the Federal Court of Appeal held as follows at paragraph 14: 
 
 
 
 "Insofar as these are findings of fact they can only be reviewed if they are erroneous and made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the Refugee Division (this standard of review is laid down in s. 18.1(4)(d) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , and is defined in other jurisdictions by the phrase 'patently unreasonable'). These findings, insofar as they apply the law to the facts of the case, can only be reviewed if they are unreasonable. insofar as they interpret the meaning of the exclusion clause, the findings can be reviewed if they are erroneous. (On the standard of review, see  
 Shrestha v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , [2002] F.C.J. No. 1154; 2002 FCT 887, Lemieux, J., at paras. 10, 11 and 12.)"
