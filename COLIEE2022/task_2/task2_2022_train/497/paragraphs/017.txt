The respondent argues that the applicant has an obligation to adduce evidence establishing a causal link between service in the Forces and the present disability, and that he failed to satisfy this obligation. The first medical evidence regarding back pain, the respondent contends, occurred in March 1993. This evidence did not lead the Board to conclude that the applicant's current back problem originated during his service because nothing in the reports attribute his lumbar disc disease to an injury such as the one the applicant claims to have occurred in 1963. The respondent submits that the Board's decision is supportable as there was no credible evidence tendered by the applicant establishing causation.
