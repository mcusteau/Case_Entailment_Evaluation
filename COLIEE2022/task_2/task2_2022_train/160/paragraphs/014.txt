  I disagree for several reasons. First, as noted by the respondent, the applicant has not correctly characterized the position taken by the Minister, who chose not to intervene in light of the applicant's rehabilitation, but did not actually take a position in favour of the applicant. This is apparent from the August 24, 2010 letter to the Board, which states in relevant part: "Please be advised that the decision not to intervene should not be interpreted as an opinion as to the merits of this refugee claim."
