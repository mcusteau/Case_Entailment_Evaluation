  In this application, the applicant argues that the Board committed three reviewable errors, and that its decision must accordingly be set aside. He first argues that the Board erred in failing to consider his rehabilitation, including that he served his entire sentence, has not reoffended, was fully forthcoming regarding his record when questioned by immigration officials and is eligible to have his conviction expunged. He argues that these facts should have led the Board to find him eligible for protection under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA as his exclusion does not further any of the purposes behind Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. Second, he argues that the fact that the Minister chose to not intervene is significant and that the Board erred in failing to give adequate weight to this fact. More precisely, he asserts that the fact that the Canadian government does not think he ought to be excluded demonstrates that the Board's conclusion is unreasonable. Finally, the applicant argues that the Board's decision is unreasonable because it does not include any analysis but simply recites the evidence and reaches a conclusion. He asserts that in the absence of any meaningful reasoning for the conclusion reached, the decision lacks transparency and is thus unreasonable.
