I find support in Justice Sopinka's reasons in
Prassard v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 560; 93 N.R 81; 57 D.L.R.(4th) 663, where absent specific rules laid down by statute or regulations, the PSSRB is free to adopt procedures it deems convenient, as long as it respects the rules of fairness and natural justice. He said at page 568:
"In order to arrive at the correct interpretation of statutory provisions that are susceptible of different meanings, they must be examined in the setting in which they appear. We are dealing here with the powers of an administrative tribunal in relation to its procedures.
As a general rule, these tribunals are considered to be masters in their own house. In the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, they control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice
."
