I simply do not agree with that position. The issue at hand is that of a dismissal, which the grievor is alleging was made in bad faith, and for which the employer has not given an employment related reason except to say the respondent did not meet the required standards. The employer, however, does not tell the respondent why he did not meet those standards. The employer cannot rely on subsection 28(2) to reject employees without giving a bona fide reason. That reason may have been given in the grievance process leading to the respondent's request for adjudication. However, I have no evidence on the point.
