I agree with the Attorney General that Parliament's intent in enacting subsection 92(3) of the
PSSRA
was to forbid the adjudication by the Board of rejections on probation. However, Parliament did not prohibit an adjudicator from ascertaining whether a rejection on probation is in reality pursuant to the
PSEA
. In
Rinaldi
, NoÃ«l, J., stated at paragraph 17:
"Contrary to the applicant's submission, no statutory amendment has limited this principle.
The addition to the
Public Service Staff Relations Act
of subsection 92(3), which bars the adjudication of a grievance with respect to a termination of employment under the
Public Service Employment Act
, does not remove jurisdiction from the Adjudicator solely because such a termination of employment is relied on by the employer. Subsection 92(3) clearly bars a referral to adjudication only where there was in fact a termination of employment under that
Act
. The hypothesis on which the Adjudicator based her decision in fact concerns a situation in which an employer disguises an unlawful dismissal under cover of the abolishment of a position through a contrived reliance on that
Act
. Such a situation would clearly fall within the jurisdiction conferred on adjudicators by paragraph 92(1)(b) of the
Public Service Staff Relations Act
." (emphasis mine)
