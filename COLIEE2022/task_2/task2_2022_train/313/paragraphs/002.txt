PSSRA
") which provides for adjudication by the Board where an employee has grieved ... a termination of employment pursuant to paragraph 11(2)(f) or (g) of the
Financial Administration Act
or disciplinary action resulting in termination.
(2) Section 28 of the
PSEA
dealing with probationary periods for people appointed from outside the public service and the rejection of a probationary employee for cause.
(3) The prohibition in subsection 92(3) of the
PSSRA
of a reference to adjudication by the Board of a termination of employment under the
PSEA
.
