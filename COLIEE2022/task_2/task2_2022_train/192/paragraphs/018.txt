  What is unsettled in the jurisprudence, however, are the circumstances in which an administrative decision-maker will be bound by the doctrine of functus officio and, therefore, unable to reopen a decision that has been made to consider new evidence and when a decision-maker is not so bound. In the  
 Soimu 
  case, Mr. Justice Rothstein at p. 288 found that since the  
 Immigration Act 
  was silent as to whether a visa officer could review decisions that had been made, it would appear that she was not functus: 
 
 
 
 "The review that she conducted might have, although it did not, result in her changing her mind and allowing the applicant's application. That indeed was the purpose of applicant's counsel's request for the review. Surely has she changed her mind it could not be said that the letter advising of her new opinion was not a decision. By the same reasoning, even though, on the review, she came to the same conclusion as before, that conclusion must also constitute a decision. 
 
 
 
 "Counsel agreed that there is nothing in the  
 Immigration Act 
  that deals with whether a visa officer may review decisions already made. Therefore, it does not appear that the visa officer was functus after she made her February 8, 1994 decision such that the April 20, 1994 decision was made without jurisdiction."
