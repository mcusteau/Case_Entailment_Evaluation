It is well settled that a response to a motion for summary judgment must set out specific facts and adduce evidence showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. The defendant has the burden to show that there is a genuine issue for trial. The defendant cannot rely on bald statements or lack of knowledge and/or denials in its pleadings to raise a genuine issue for trial. The defendant must put its "best foot forward" and this requires that the defendant lead evidence and make an argument that there is a genuine issue requiring a trial.
