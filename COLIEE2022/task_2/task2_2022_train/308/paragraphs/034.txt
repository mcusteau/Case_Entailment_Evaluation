In the
Anton Piller K.G.
case, Lord Denning M.R. specified at page 61 that the order does not authorize the plaintiffs' solicitors or anyone else to enter the defendants' premises against their will. If the defendants refuse permission to enter or to inspect, the plaintiffs must not force their way in.
