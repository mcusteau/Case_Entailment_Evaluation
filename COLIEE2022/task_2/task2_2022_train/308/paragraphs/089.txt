In this case, the plaintiffs were concerned that the defendants might destroy or alter evidence stored on computers and related documentary evidence. They requested an order so that they could enter and search for unauthorized copies of the plaintiffs' computer programs on the defendants' computers, and preserve evidence relating to the existence of those copies. McArthur Thompson subsequently deleted from its computer systems evidence in the form of unlicensed copies of the plaintiffs' software which were identified in the original search. It cannot now be argued that the plaintiffs should be denied an Anton Piller type order preserving evidence when that evidence was in fact destroyed.
