  The wording of the relevant provisions, particularly the above underlined portion of subsection 168(1) of the  
 Act 
 , does not indicate that there is an objective test to be met against which an applicant's evidence is to be measured. If there was an objective test, and the Court was convinced that an applicant's evidence met the test, there would be a reason to find that no other result could come from a redetermination by the RPD. However, during an abandonment hearing the RPD is to consider various factors, including evidence and explanations, and then reach a decision as to whether, in its opinion, the applicant is in default. Given that this involves an assessment of evidence and information, and the exercise of some discretion, in my view the determination is best left to the RPD. This view is re-enforced by the absence of express evidence with respect to Mr. Johnson's ability to start the hearing.
