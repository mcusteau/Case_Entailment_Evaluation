Dub√©, J.
: This motion is for a review pursuant to s. 41 of the
Access to Information Act
(the Act) [see footnote 1]. The application is unusual in the sense that the records requested by Mr. X have already been provided to him by the respondent, but after the extension period of delay had expired.
