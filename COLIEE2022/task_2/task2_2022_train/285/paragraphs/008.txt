The purpose of the
Access to Information Act
, as stipulated under s. 2, is to provide the right of access to information in records under the control of a government institution in accordance with the principle that government information should be available to the public. In keeping with that general intent, s. 10(3) provides that where the head of a government institution fails to give access to a record requested within the time limits set out in the Act, he shall be deemed to have refused to give access. Thus the intention of the Act, as framed, is clearly to ensure that the requestors' access to information is not frustrated by bureaucratic procrastination: footdragging equates refusal.
