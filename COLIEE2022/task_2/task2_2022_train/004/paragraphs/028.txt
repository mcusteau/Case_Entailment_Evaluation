  The  
 CHRA 
  grants the CHRC a remarkable degree of latitude when it is performing its screening function on receipt of an investigative report. As a general rule, it may be said that Parliament did not want the Court, at this stage, to intervene lightly in the decisions of the CHRC:  
 Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paper Workers Union of Canada et al. 
 , [1999] 1 F.C. 113; 233 N.R. 87 (F.C.A.), leave to appeal dismissed [1999] 2 S.C.R. v; 243 N.R. 397 ( 
 Bell 
 ). Thus, the scope for judicial review of the decisions of the CHRC is narrow:  
 Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Human Rights Commission 
  (1997), 130 F.T.R. 241 (T.D.), affd. (1999) 245 N.R. 397 (F.C.A.), leave to appeal dismissed [2000] 1 S.C.R. viii; 255 N.R. 196 ( 
 Canada Post 
 ).
