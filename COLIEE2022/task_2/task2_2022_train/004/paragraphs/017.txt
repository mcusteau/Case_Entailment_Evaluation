  Regarding the investigation, it is apparent that Ms. Lusina assumes that the CHRC did not have regard to the merits of her complaint pursuant to sections 7 and 10 of the  
 CHRA 
 . She claims that, although she provided a witness list, none of the witnesses were interviewed by the investigator. She also submits, based on two e-mails and a memorandum from the manager of pay equity to the case support committee, that her complaint was treated as a pay equity case. She finds fault with the failure of the investigator to mention anything in the investigation report that would indicate that her complaint was dealt with on its merits.
