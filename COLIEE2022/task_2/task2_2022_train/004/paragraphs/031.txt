  To establish such a fair basis, the investigator must satisfy two conditions: neutrality and thoroughness. Where the parties make submissions in response to an investigator's report, the parties may be able to compensate for omissions (in the investigator's report) by bringing such omissions to the attention of the decision-maker. Judicial review is warranted only where complainants are unable to rectify such omissions. Circumstances where further submissions cannot compensate for an investigator's omissions include circumstances where the omission is of such a fundamental nature that merely drawing the decision-maker's attention to the omission cannot compensate for it: ibid (
