  Last, Ms. Lusina argues that the CHRC erred in failing to consider the circumstances under which she signed the agreement. She claims that she was told by CÃ©line Harrington, counsel for the CHRC, that she could not sign away her human rights. She asserts that the agreement was signed for purposes of employment severance and does not, in any respect, affect her right to submit a human rights complaint. Furthermore, Ms. Lusina submits, she signed the agreement under pressure and duress - due to her financial situation - to ensure that she would not jeopardize her pension and to mitigate her losses. Relying on  
 Brine v. Canada Ports Corp. 
  (1999), 175 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.) and  
 Pritchard v. Human Rights Commission (Ont.) et al. 
  (1999), 122 O.A.C. 302; 45 O.R.(3d) 97 (Div. Ct.), respectively for the propositions that the CHRC has a prima facie duty to deal with a complaint and that a finding of "bad faith" requires satisfaction of a high threshold going beyond bad judgment or negligence, Ms. Lusina argues that it is not plain and obvious that her complaint falls within the bad faith exception under paragraph 41(1)(d) of the  
 CHRA 
 . Accordingly, the CHRC erred in dismissing it.
