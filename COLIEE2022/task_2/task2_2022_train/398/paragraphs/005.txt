As a further expression of general principle, it is useful to refer to the affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent of John Lynn Baker, Director of Immigration and Refugee Affairs Division, External Affairs Canada. The affidavit consists of twenty-five paragraphs and provides a complete description of the process at issue here, including the qualifications and responsibilities of the visa officers abroad. I quote paragraph 15:
"15. Alternate occupations will also be considered by the officers where there is the possibility that the applicant is qualified for and prepared to follow that occupation."
