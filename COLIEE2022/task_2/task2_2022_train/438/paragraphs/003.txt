A preliminary issue raised by the parties was the appropriate standard of review to be applied in this case. Beyond this question, the single issue raised by the Applicant is whether the Board erred by concluding that the Applicant had a viable Internal Flight Alternative. Related to this issue were the following two subsidiary issues:
1. Did the Board err by finding that Jews are generally not at risk in Kiev?
2. Did the Board err by failing to consider the Applicant's perceived ethnicity from the perspective of the alleged agents of persecution?
