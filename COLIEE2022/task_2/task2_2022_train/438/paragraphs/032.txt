Further, I fail to see any error of consequence from the Board's failure to make explicit mention of the threat to Jews from the violent neo-Nazi fringe. In the decision, there is specific reference to the steps taken by the central government in Ukraine "to protect its citizens from violence and its incitement". In making this statement, I am satisfied that the Board turned its mind to the possible sources of "violence and its incitement" that were included in the documentary evidence, including the neo-Nazi groups referred to by the Applicant. As a result, the Board's conclusions regarding the risks faced by Jews generally in Ukraine were supported by the evidence before it and were not patently unreasonable.
