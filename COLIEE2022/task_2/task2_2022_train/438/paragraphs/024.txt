Kiev, the proposed IFA, is approximately 550 kilometres from Odessa. Between 1998 and 2000, the Applicant worked for about six months for his uncle and another company in Kiev. Although Shevchuk did follow the Applicant on one occasion for sixty or seventy kilometres on his way to Kiev, Shevchuk never actually came to Kiev in order to continue his vendetta.
