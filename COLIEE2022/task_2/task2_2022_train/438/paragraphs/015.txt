According to the Supreme Court of Canada in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321; 103 D.L.R.(4th) 1, absent a situation of complete breakdown of the statue apparatus, it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting its citizens. Because of this presumption, "clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect must be provided" (
Ward
, supra, at para. 50).
