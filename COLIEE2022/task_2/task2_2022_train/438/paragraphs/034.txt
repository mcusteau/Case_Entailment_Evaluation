Contrary to the submission of the Applicant, the Board's decision indicates that it did consider the possibility that the Applicant would be recognized as Jewish as a result of his observations of the Jewish faith or traditions, his passport or other identity documents. In my view, based on the evidence before the Board, including the fact that the Applicant does not practise his faith and the documentary evidence, there was no reviewable error. Its conclusion was that there was not a reasonable chance that the Applicant would suffer persecution at the hands of violent anti-Semitic groups, the alleged agents of persecution, in Kiev because he was Jewish. This conclusion was not perverse or patently unreasonable.
