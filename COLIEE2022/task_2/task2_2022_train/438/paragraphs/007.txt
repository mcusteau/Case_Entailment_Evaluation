The Federal Court of Appeal discussed the concept of IFA in
Thirunavukkarasu v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1994] 1 F.C. 589; 163 N.R. 232 (F.C.A.). Linden, J.A., writing for the Court, stated at paragraph 2 that the notion of IFA is:
"... merely a convenient, short-hand way of describing a fact situation in which a person may be in danger of persecution in one part of a country but not in another. The idea of an internal flight alternative is 'inherent' in the definition of a Convention refugee [...]; it is not something separate at all. That definition requires that the claimants have a well-founded fear of persecution which renders them unable or unwilling to return to their home country. If claimants are able to seek safe refuge within their own country, there is no basis for finding that they are unable or unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country."
