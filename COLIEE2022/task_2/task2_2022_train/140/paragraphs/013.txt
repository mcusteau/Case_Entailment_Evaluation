  As stated by Mr. Justice Edmond Blanchard in Burgos v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1537, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1537 (QL): 
 
 
 
 [36] However, when it considers the issue of state protection, the Court cannot require that the protection currently available be perfectly effective. The following excerpt written by Mr. Justice James Hugessen in Villafranca v. M.E.I., [1992] F.C.J. No. 1189 (F.C.A.) (QL), sets out this principle: 
 
 
 
 On the other hand, where a state is in effective control of its territory, has military, police and civil authority in place, and makes serious efforts to protect its citizens from terrorist activities, the mere fact that it is not always successful at doing so will not be enough to justify a claim that the victims of terrorism are unable to avail themselves of such protection. 
 
 
 
 [37] In spite of this, the mere willingness of a state to ensure the protection of its citizens is not sufficient in itself to establish its ability. Protection must nevertheless have a certain degree of effectiveness (Bobrik v. M.C.I., [1994] F.C.J. No. 1364 (T.D.) (QL).

 [42] By determining that there was adequate protection in Mexico and that the applicants could have made a complaint following the incidents of August 21, 2005, and October 2, 2005, the Board rendered an unreasonable decision, in that it failed to take into consideration that the situation of the applicants was aggravated on both occasions when they made complaints to two different authorities. This conclusion is contrary to the principle established by the Supreme Court in Ward, according to which an applicant does not have to "risk his or her life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness". This error warrants intervention by this Court insofar as this determination could not stand up to a probing examination.
