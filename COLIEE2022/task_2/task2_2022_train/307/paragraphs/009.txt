Fourth, the failure of a business as a consequence of removal does not necessarily constitute irreparable harm in every case. The applicants cite Toth v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (F.C.A.) (1988), 86 N.R. 302 ("Toth") in support of this argument. In this decision, a stay was granted in circumstances where the deportation order would have meant the end of a business which was supporting the applicant's family and a number of employees. One may suffer irreparable harm if one has a business and cannot divest oneself of that business, and as a result, loses a substantial sum of money. In the case at bar, I accept the respondent's submission that there is absolutely no evidence regarding the worth of the principal applicant's business, whether it employed anyone other than the applicant, whether or not the applicant would be able to sell the business, or even what kind of financial loss, if any, the applicants would face. As a result, the applicants have not established irreparable harm: Siljanovski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 923 at paras. 6-7 (T.D.); Startchev v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 931, 2002 FCT 690 at para. 8; Sanchez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1995] F.C.J. No. 1647 at para. 7 (T.D.); Qayyum v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 192 at para. 2 (T.D.); and Toth, supra.
