  Review of a subsection 84(2) determination engages a two-step process: first, a determination on whether the information submitted constitutes new facts; second, a decision on entitlement takes place if there are new facts.  
 Peplinski v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) 
 , [1993] 1 F.C. 222; 58 F.T.R. 247 (T.D.), at paragraph 11. If there are no new facts, then the prior decision stands. As will become evident below, I need only address the first part of this process.
