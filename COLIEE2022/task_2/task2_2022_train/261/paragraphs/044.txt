It is clear from both sets of guidelines that changed country conditions giving rise to what is tantamount to a well-founded fear of persecution constitute a valid ground for granting humanitarian and compassionate relief. In the pre-1993
Guidelines
, this situation was addressed by s. 9.07(4)(b), (c) and (d), which reads:
"(b) Others may warrant consideration because of their personal circumstances in relation to current laws and practices in their country of origin. Such persons could reasonably expect unduly harsh or inhumane treatment in their country should they be removed. In these cases there should be strong reasons to believe that the person will face a life threatening situation in his or her homeland as a direct result of the political or social situation in that country. Such situations are far more likely to occur in countries with repressive governments or those experiencing civil strife or at war.
"(c) Persons described above will, in most cases, have indicated an intention to claim refugee status and a review of their situation will occur in the context of the refugee claim procedures (see IE 12 or the Backlog Clearance Procedures (IB) Manual). Officers may, however, also deal with requests from persons who are reluctant to claim refugee status, either because of fear for families living abroad or because they realize that they would not meet the strict Convention refugee definition. These persons may, nevertheless, feel that their situation warrants special consideration.
"(d) Officers will consider the facts of the case and recommend what they believe is reasonable in the particular situation. The onus is on the applicants to satisfy the officer that (a) a particular situation exists in their country and that (b) their particular circumstances in relation to that situation make them worthy of positive discretion."
