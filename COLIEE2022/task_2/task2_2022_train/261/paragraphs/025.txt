I acknowledge that there does seem to be an inherent unfairness in providing a mechanism for the Minister to introduce evidence of changed country circumstances on an ongoing basis, pursuant to rule 9, while depriving refugee claimants of a corresponding privilege. However, while I accept the general proposition in
Chandler
that flexibility must govern application of the "functus" doctrine in the administrative context, the operative words of Mr. Justice Sopinka's statement are that such flexibility is to apply
where there are indications in the governing statute that a decision can be reopened
. Applied to the context of the present case, the
C.R.D.D. Rules
, by virtue of their status as subordinate legislation, can only alter the substantive law of "functus officio" to the extent that the
Act
permits them to. I can see no specific
statutory
grounding for the creation of a rule that would alter the substantive law of "functus officio" as far as refugee applicants are concerned. In fact, there are some strong indications in the
Act
to the contrary.
