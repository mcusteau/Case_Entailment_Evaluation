Nadon, J.
: This is an application for an order quashing a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "C.R.D.D."), dated April 28, 1993, whereby the applicants' motion for a rehearing of their Convention refugee claims was dismissed. The applicants also seek an order remitting the matter back for a redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
