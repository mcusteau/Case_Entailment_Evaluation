Grewal v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 135 N.R. 310; 85 D.L.R.(4th) 166 (F.C.A.), involved a landed immigrant from India who was ordered to be deported for having committed a criminal offence while in Canada. The applicant in
Grewal
appealed the deportation order before the Immigration Appeal Board, on the ground of alleged "suffering" that he would experience upon his return to India caused by the publicity surrounding his crime and conviction. At the time of the appeal, there was some evidence (i.e., a book that had been published) of the alleged publicity and additional evidence of alleged human rights abuses in India. The appeal was dismissed and leave to the Federal Court of Appeal was denied as well. Subsequently, a report about Grewal's lost appeal and upcoming deportation appeared in the Punjabi press. According to Grewal, authorities in his home village warned people not to "harbour" him upon his return and he was warned by several people that he would face violence or death upon his return. Despite these new developments, Grewal was denied humanitarian and compassionate relief. At that point Grewal applied to the Immigration Appeal Board to reopen the appeal of the deportation order based on the new information of the risk that he would face upon his return to the Punjab. This application was dismissed as well.
