It is clear to me that what the applicants are challenging is not the complete absence of a mechanism to deal with post-proceeding evidence of changed country conditions, but rather the manner in which evidence is considered under the sole alternative vehicle available to claimants wishing to raise such evidence: the humanitarian and compassionate relief process. Paragraphs 91 to 97 of the applicants' Supplementary Memorandum of Argument describe how the criteria for granting humanitarian and compassionate relief under s. 114(2) of the
Act
are discretionary and "virtually insurmountable". The applicants go on to cite statistics showing a low (approximately 3%) acceptance rate on H & C applications of refused claimants between January 1, 1989 and March 21, 1993. Based on these points, the applicants submit that the "safety net" provided by s. 114(2) is illusory and that the requirements of fundamental justice can only be met if they would be provided an opportunity to present their evidence of changed country conditions in Pakistan in a setting such as a C.R.D.D. hearing, where the procedural safeguards associated with a quasi-judicial hearing are present.
