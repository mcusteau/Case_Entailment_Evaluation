Shortly after the Alberta Court of Appeal's decision, the Board notified the Group and its members that it intended to continue the original hearing with a view to preparing a report for the Council that would perhaps recommend sending the matter on to the Committee. The group and its members applied to the court once again, this time to obtain an order to prohibit the Board from continuing the hearing on the grounds that the Board was "functus officio". The matter was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.
