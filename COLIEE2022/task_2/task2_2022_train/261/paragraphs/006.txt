The applicants' position is that the principle of "functus officio", as enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in the cases of
Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1988), 6 Imm. L.R.(2d) 10 (F.C.A.);
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Nabiye
, [1989] 3 F.C. 424; 102 N.R. 390; 8 Imm. L.R.(2d) 190 (F.C.A.) and

L.R.(2d) 312 (F.C.A.), is no longer applicable to circumstances such as the one in the present case where a deterioration in home country conditions after a negative C.R.D.D. decision raises a fear of persecution. According to the applicants, the scope of the doctrine was narrowed with the inclusion of rule 30 of the
Convention Refugee Determination Division Rules
, SOR/89-103 [see Footnote 2], which came into force in 1989, and in the aftermath of the decision rendered by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects
