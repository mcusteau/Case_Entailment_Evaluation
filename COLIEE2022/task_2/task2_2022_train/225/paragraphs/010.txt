  On this point, the tribunal concluded: 
 
 
 
 "Considering that the said detention is a major element of the past persecution and also justifies the fear of future persecution by the police, it is surprising that it is not mentioned in the above documents disclosed by the Plaintiff. We may add that these letters were obtained by the claimant when he was already in Canada that they were written a few weeks before the hearing and that they are based on the claimant's narrative. The Federal Court has ruled in Hamid that when a claimant is not credible, the Board may not give probative value to the documents he disclosed to support his story. This is the case here. Furthermore, the claimant travelled with a false passport, which proves that he was able to obtain fraudulent documents."
