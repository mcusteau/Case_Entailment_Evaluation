  Finally, of the treatment of the lawyer's letter, I find, once again, the tribunal misread the evidence. The claimant was able to explain why his father required the help of a lawyer in 2005. It was not because the police had allegedly been looking for him since 2004. In addition, the tribunal doubted the lawyer even existed. Yet it had previously given some weight to that letter on the detention question.
