  These cases as applied by the Federal Court of Appeal itself and by this Court proscribe credibility findings arrived at by, for example: 
 
 
 
 - Findings for which there was no evidence; 
 
 
 
 - Findings of the tribunal based on conjecture, resulting in unjustified and unsupported inferences regarding the circumstances leading to an application for refugee status; 
 
 
 
 - Inconsistencies drawn between POE notes and an applicant's testimony or the applicant's PIF where a tribunal dwells on details and not on the substance of the claim and leads to misconstruction of the evidence. Any such inconsistencies should be major and not minor and sufficient by itself to call into question the applicant's credibility. (See  
 Mushtaq v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 616; 2003 FC 1066; and 
 
 
 
 - The tribunal must be reasonable in rejecting an applicant's explanation when confronted with a contradiction and must not be quick to apply North American logic and reasoning to a claimant's behaviour (see  
 Lubana 
 , supra, at para. 12); 
 
 
 
 - The tribunal must assess the applicant's claim against the totality of the evidence.
