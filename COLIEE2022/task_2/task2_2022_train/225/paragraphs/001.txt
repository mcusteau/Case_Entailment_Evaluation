 Lemieux, J. 
 : Sadat Jamil, a citizen of Bangladesh, challenges the September 30, 2005 decision of the Refugee Protection Division (the tribunal) rejecting his claim for protection pursuant to ss. 96 and 97 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  (the  
 Act 
 ). The tribunal found the applicant not to be credible. It stated "Mr. Jamil is a bogus claimant who makes a mockery of the refugee system. Claims of this kind tend to discredit the Board".
