  The tribunal touched upon a final point indicating it was only in 2005 when the applicant was already in Canada his father decided to retain the services of a lawyer in Bangladesh. The tribunal found the applicant was unable to explain why his father required the help of a lawyer so late, as the police had allegedly been looking for him since 2004. He could not furnish a reasonable explanation on this issue. As indicated above, the lawyer's letter is clearly designed to help the claimant in Canada-"that is if such a lawyer exists".
