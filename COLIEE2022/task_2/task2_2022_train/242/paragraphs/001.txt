Lutfy, A.C.J.
[orally]: In reasons for order issued on November 16, 1999, I found that the defendant Musadiq Pardhan was guilty of contempt of court for breaching the interÂ­locutory injunction of MacKay, J., dated January 8, 1996. The order restrained Mr. Pardhan and other persons from exporting Coca-Cola products from Canada.
