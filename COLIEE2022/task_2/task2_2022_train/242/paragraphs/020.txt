In
Dimatt Investments Inc. v. Presidio Clothing Inc.
(1993), 62 F.T.R. 142; 48 C.P.R.(3d) 46 (T.D.), another proceeding involving contempt of court in trademark litigation, Justice MacKay concluded as follows on costs:
"In addition to imposing fines, I ordered that reasonable costs, on a solicitor and client basis be awarded to the plaintiff. This accords with normal practice in a successful application for an Order finding contempt, ensuring that the role of the party acting to support compliance with an Order of the court does not result in undue costs for the applicant."
