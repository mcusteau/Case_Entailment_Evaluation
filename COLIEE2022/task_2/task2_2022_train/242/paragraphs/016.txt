In
Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. v. Cato
, [1990] 3 F.C. 541; 36 F.T.R. 81 (T.D.), the first defendant was fined $1,500 for each of four separate breaches of court orders. The second defendant was fined $3,000 for each of two separate breaches of court orders. The penalties were related to the existence of four separate injunctive orders which were clearly referred to in two separate show cause orders. Again, this is not a precedent upon which the plaintiffs can properly rely in support of the multiple fines they seek in this proceeding.
