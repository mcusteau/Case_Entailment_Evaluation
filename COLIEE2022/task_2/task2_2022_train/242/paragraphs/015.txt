In
Vuitton (Louis) S.A. v. Tokyo-Do Enterprises Inc.
(1990), 37 C.P.R.(3d) 8 (F.C.T.D.), the defendant was fined $2,500 for each of two contempt of court convictions pursuant to the terms of two separate show cause orders which refer to the same injunction. The two show cause orders, one issued seven months prior to the other, specify the details of the transactions with respect to which the defendant was charged in breach of the terms of the injunction. The general terms of the show cause order in this case are substantially different from the very specific language of the corresponding orders in
Louis Vuitton
. In addition, the total penalty in
Louis Vuitton
did not exceed $5,000.
