In this case, the principal mitigating factor is the dismissal of the plaintiffs' action and the dissolution of the injunction. This factor, coupled with the subject matter of the litigation, dictates that the penalty be limited to a monetary fine. However, this is not a case of one or two isolated acts. The activities of Sid Enterprise extended over a period of some 16 months. The conduct of Musadiq Pardhan, in the commission of the acts prohibited by the injunction, was deliberate, camouflaged through subterfuge and in blatant disregard of the court order. The facts in this case differ substantially from those in

(1996), 116 F.T.R. 25; 68 C.P.R.(3d) 262 (T.D.). At the very end of the hearing on penalty and costs, and when asked whether he wished to make any statement, the defendant Musadiq Pardhan offered a form of apology to the court. In view of all these circumstances, I have concluded that the appropriate penalty is a fine of $4,000.
