In my estimation, party and party costs would represent approximately one-third of the solicitor-client costs, excluding disbursements, being sought by the plaintiffs. Even taking into account the dissolution of the injunction, there is no reason, in my view, to limit the plaintiffs to party and party costs. In June and July 1998, the defendant Musadiq Pardhan, with the knowledge of substantially all the plaintiffs' evidence adduced in court, refused the offer to admit his liability on the contempt charge and to pay a fine of $4,000 and costs on a party and party scale. None of the reasons advanced by his counsel to justify the non-acceptance of the plaintiffs' offer to settle is legally significant. The refusal of the plaintiffs' offer unduly extended this litigation, a factor which I have considered in the determination of the reasonable costs to be paid.
