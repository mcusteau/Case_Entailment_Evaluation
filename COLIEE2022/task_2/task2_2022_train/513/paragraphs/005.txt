Notwithstanding that he obtained zero units in the occupational factor and was therefore not entitled to the issuance of an immigrant visa under s. 11(2) of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978 SOR/78-122 as amended, the applicant says that the visa officer erred in not exercising her discretion under s. 11(3) of the
Regulations
[see footnote 1]. Section 11(3) does not specify what is required to engage the visa officer's exercise of discretion under it. Nothing precludes the visa officer, on his or her own motion, from proceeding under s. 11(3) if he or she considers that it is warranted to do so. However, if an applicant wishes the visa officer to exercise discretion under s. 11(3), it would seem that some form of application would be required. While there is no prescribed wording to which an applicant must adhere, I would think the application would at least have to indicate some good reasons why a units of assessment determination would not reflect the chances of successful establishment in Canada by the applicant. There was no such application here.
