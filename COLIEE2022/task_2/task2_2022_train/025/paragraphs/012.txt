  I agree with this reasoning and conclude that the appropriate standard to apply to the Board's decision in this case is that of reasonableness. Accordingly, as long as the Board's reasons are "tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination," then the decision is reasonable and the Court will not interfere with the Board's decision: see
