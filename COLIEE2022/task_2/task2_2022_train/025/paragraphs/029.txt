  In my view, the Board's analysis inadequately addresses the applicant's circumstances particularly that her alleged persecutor is very powerful within the exact jurisdiction where she was assaulted. Accordingly, the Board's analysis of state protection is too general and fails to consider the applicant's particular situation; a fact that becomes even more serious given that the Board did not make any negative credibility assessments, thereby accepting the fact that the applicant has suffered significant trauma at that hands of her alleged persecutor.
