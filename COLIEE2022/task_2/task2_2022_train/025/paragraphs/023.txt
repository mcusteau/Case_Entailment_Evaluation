  In  
 Kadenko v. Canada (Solicitor General) 
  (1996), 206 N.R. 272 (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal held that in order to rebut the presumption of state protection, refugee claimants must make "reasonable efforts" at seeking out state protection, and that the burden on the claimant increases where the state in question is democratic.
