  In my view, the Officer supported her decision in finding that the applicant's level of establishment in Canada was simply not high enough to justify that the H & C application be granted. For example, she stated that: 
 
 
 
 · The applicant had no family members in Canada. His parents and four sisters were all still in Congo. The applicant did mention that his "extended family" consisted of members of the liberal party. However, the applicant provided no proof of his involvement with any of their activities. 
 
 
 
 · The claim that the applicant was saving money in order to find a job in the IT field could not be verified, as the applicant submitted no documents from his financial institution to support it. Furthermore, no proof was submitted to convince the Officer that the applicant really was trying to enter the field of IT. 
 
 
 
 · Although the applicant stated that he was enrolled in school, no proof was provided to support his claim that he was attempting to improve his English.
