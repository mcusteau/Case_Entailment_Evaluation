  As for the argument that the Officer erred in imposing a legal requirement that the applicant demonstrate a particular risk in order to show an unusual or undeserved hardship, I find it to be unfounded in the facts before me. The Officer simply stated in the earlier part of her decision that the applicant had not convinced her of a personalized risk. During the second part of her decision, she then goes on to analyse the hardship which would be experienced by the applicant if he were to be denied his H & C application. There is no error on behalf of the Officer. As has been stated previously, H & C grounds may exist in cases that would not meet the "unusual and undeserved" criterion but where the hardship of having to apply for an immigrant visa from outside of Canada would have a disproportionate impact on the applicant due to his or her personal circumstances.
