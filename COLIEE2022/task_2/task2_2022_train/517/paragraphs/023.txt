On this view of the NOC the visa officer was correct to conclude that the applicant did not satisfy the ETF for an accountant. This is because Mr. Madan lacked the accreditation required for the three occupations listed under the generic occupational category of accountant. If in his affidavit the visa officer meant that Mr. Madan did not qualify as an accountant because he had no university degree in accounting, I do not think that his interpretation of the NOC was correct.
