It is clear from the letter of decision written by the visa officer in response to that application that Mr. Madan had applied in the intended occupation of "miscellaneous accountant". This occupation carries relatively few units of assessment for either occupational demand in Canada, or Special Vocational Preparation. The visa officer at that time also assessed Mr. Madan's application by considering the related occupation of "book keeper", in which the applicant was qualified and experienced. However, in neither occupation was the applicant awarded sufficient units of assessment to obtain a favourable decision, and his application was refused.
