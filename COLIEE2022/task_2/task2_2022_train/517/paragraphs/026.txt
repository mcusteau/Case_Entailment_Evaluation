Accordingly, the visa officer will only have erred in law if his conclusion that the applicant did not satisfy the ETF requirements for accountants was unreasonable or, perhaps, patently unreasonable:
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 243 N.R. 22 (S.C.C.). Given the ambiguities of the text, the technical and non-legal nature of the subject matter, and the fact that the applicant can always submit a fresh application, I cannot say that the visa officer's conclusion was so unreasonable that the decision to refuse a visa should be set aside as erroneous in law.
