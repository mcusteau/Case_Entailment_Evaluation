As I have indicated above, one reading of the CAIPS notes is that the officer did consider this occupation, but because he concluded that the applicant did not meet the ETF for it, he proceeded no further. Nonetheless, it is certainly possible to infer from the visa officer's affidavit that he did not make an assessment in this occupation, since he stated that neither the applicant nor his counsel had requested that the application be assessed for the occupation of accountant, which he also said was not a related occupation to that of financial manager.
