One further point should be noted here. Attached to the visa application submitted on behalf of Mr. Madan by Sun Enterprises Inc. of Toronto was the following note, which I infer was written by the person at Sun who submitted the application:
"INTENDED OCCUPATION:
FINANCIAL MANAGER SUPPLEMENT
TO SECTION 17
Considering the applicant's job duties, work experience and educational and training background, we have put his application through under the financial manager category - as is apparent from his rejection letter he was considered under the 'miscellaneous accountant job duties' - we trust our justification under the new category of 'financial manager' holds strong ground."
"Section 17" refers to the space on the visa application form where the applicant is asked to complete, "my intended occupation in Canada is".
