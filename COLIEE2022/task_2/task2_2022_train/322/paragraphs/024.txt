[24]
That affidavit, a copy of which is Exhibit 26, contains several references to the brothers' business relationship being "a venture" or "a joint venture". Mr. Rodger's cross-examination on that matter, recorded in the transcript: volume 4, p. 444, runs thus:
"Q. This is filed in the Supreme Court of B.C. on January 9, 1984, and it's signed January 5, 1984. This is the so-called five page affidavit of William Pankiw, and he refers in here in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 to venture or joint venture. Do you recall that?
A. Yes, I recall that.
Q. Yes, okay, Did that, did you now perhaps draw any inference from that, counter to what you had thought?
A. During, when I was building up these things, I had an interview with William Pankiw, and I noted that he had referred to joint venture, and different things. I asked him about joint venture and what he meant by that, and to him, he referred to me that it was just a term he used."
The court does not infer that Mr. Rodger was too eager to believe the worst, but it is prepared to infer that the worst is what he received from and during his interview with William Pankiw, based on William's manner of testifying on the various issues and documents, not least his self-worded résumé of the initial oral agreement, Exhibit 25. From William Pankiw's testimony and demeanour at trial, "just a term he used" appears to be another excuse in the hot-and-cold, shifting inconsistencies of his on-again-off-again descriptions of a relationship in which he wanted shares in Cantex while not wanting such shares lest he be enmeshed in "the arm's length problem", the statutory association of Cantex and Northland.
