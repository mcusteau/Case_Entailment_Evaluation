From the date of its incorporation, February 25, 1971, Cantex's shareholdings, insofar as being material to these proceedings, have always been directly vested in John Pankiw (John) for 99%, and his wife Frances Pankiw (Frances) for 1%. The Minister, however, asserts that more than 10%, indeed 50%, of the Cantex shares were indirectly held by John's brother, William Pankiw (William) who was, at all material times, the virtually sole shareholder of Northland. The defendant relies upon s. 251(2), s. 256(1)(c) and s. 256(2) of the Income Tax Act. Consequent upon such assertions by the Minister, he
"reassessed the plaintiff to tax with respect to its 1978 to 1983 taxation years so as to increase its liability to tax on the basis that 'The Small Business Deduction is not applicable due to the Cumulative Deduction Account exceeding the Total Business Limit' with respect to the 1978 taxation year by a calculation of the Small Business Deduction 'based upon a 50/50 allocation,'"
as the defendant formally admits.
