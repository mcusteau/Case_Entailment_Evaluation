It is, however, significant that in May 1975, John and Frances were then prepared to issue 49 shares in Cantex to William. To that aborted end a company resolution and a share certificate, Exhibit 6, were executed as part of the brothers' intended rationalization package, which never came into being because William declined to execute his part of the intended documentation. John and Frances testified that Exhibit 6 was completed before the break up. William testified that he learned of that share certificate only from the defendant's counsel and the departmental investigator in November 1987. His solicitors had a copy of the share certificate in their file and William seeks to have the court believe that he was not told of it. Such withholding of that information from William by his solicitor is possible, but highly improbable. The court does not accept William's testimony on that matter. Based on William's demeanour and his established appreciation of the matter of associated companies, the logical inference is that he would not touch it or even acknowledge the certificate's existence, lest he precipitate the very detriment which he had thus far succeeded in avoiding. Incredibly, William testified upon cross-examination to the following inconsistencies and improbabilities, recorded in the transcript: volume 4 at pp. 368 and 369:
"A. I wrote a letter to my lawyers demanding my shares.
Q. In 1981.
A. And '82.
Q. In '81 and '82, that's when the arbitration was going on, right?
A. Right.
Q. But prior to that time you didn't do one thing in the way of any formal sense. You say that you'd been complaining to John, where are my shares, he denies that. But, I want to ask you, did you have a lawyer write a demand letter, did you make an application in court to do anything under the B.C. Company Act in any formal way to secure your interest in that company in the way of owning shares? You didn't, did you?
A. No, I didn't."
