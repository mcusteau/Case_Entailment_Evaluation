John testified that he was unable to finance purchase of that land without help from William. John took an option to gain time to discover if the land could be rezoned and if a gravel extraction permit could be obtained. John approached William for the financing but the latter asserted that neither John, nor Cantex, nor John and William jointly ought to buy the land. Rather, William insisted, he would buy that land, as a guaranty for his share of Cantex's earnings - as distinct be it noted, from shares of Cantex. It was thereupon understood that John would be entitled to a half interest in the Wiltse lands and William would be entitled to a half of Cantex's earnings. William asked, again, that such understanding be formalized at some indefinite future time. In the meanwhile Cantex could extract gravel and pay royalties.
