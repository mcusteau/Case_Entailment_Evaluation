One could go on to analyze the documentary evidence and testimony of William Pankiw without finding any consistent evidence of association of Cantex, Paradise and Northland. His résumé of the oral agreement, Exhibit 25 earlier mentioned, is self-serving and written in his own words as late, at least, as 1976 and probably even more recently, as may be inferred from the last paragraph on page 9. Two aspects of that narration, self-serving as it is, stand out. The first is that William describes his relationship with John in three places, at least, as a partnership. He testified that his educational achievement was such that his terminology is not precise, but his vocabulary in his testimony renders that excuse improbable. The second aspect is what the whole narrative insistently proclaims: from the time he aborted the preliminary oral agreement and balked at becoming a shareholder of Cantex in 1971 through the arbitration proceedings and to the present he has never "owned directly or indirectly in respect of" Cantex or 1056 Enterprises Ltd., any "of the issued shares of any class of the capital stock thereof". The search to rationalize the brothers' relationship proceeded in fits and starts, but no agreement, or legal relationship was ever consummated by which the companies ever became associated within the meaning of the Income Tax Act.
