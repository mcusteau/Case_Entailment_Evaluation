[35]
The Board erred in exercise of jurisdiction by coming to a conclusion that failed to deal expressly with evidence from which an inference favourable to the applicant might have been drawn. An Order issues quashing the decision of Board and returning the matter for re-determination before a differently constituted panel of the Board to reconsider this matter in a manner consistent with these reasons.
Application allowed.
