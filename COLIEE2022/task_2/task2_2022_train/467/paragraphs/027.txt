The respondent argues that this Court should not interfere with the Board's decision in this matter because there was no evidence upon which the Board could find a pensionable disability. I note that considerable curial deference afforded by the patent unreasonableness standard of review should be accorded by the Court to the Board's decision where that it concerns a primary finding of fact. In
McTague v. Canada (A.G.)
, supra, Justice Evans (as he was then) stated:
"The weight of the factors considered above in the pragmatic or functional analysis suggests that Parliament should be regarded as prescribing a deferential standard of review in this case. However, they do not indicate that the most deferential standard should be applied. 'Patent unreasonableness' seems increasingly to be reserved as the standard of review applied to the decisions of administrative agencies that are protected by strong preclusive clauses and have a wider range of regulatory responsibilities than the merely adjudicative functions performed by the Board. Patent unreasonableness is also the appropriate standard ... where the issue in dispute involves findings of primary fact, including the drawing of inferences from the evidence."
