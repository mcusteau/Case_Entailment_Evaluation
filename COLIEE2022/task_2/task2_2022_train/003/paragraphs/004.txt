  As mentioned above, in the evaluation of the Applicant's admissibility, his age, identity, and family relationships were not in doubt prior to the detection of the misrepresentation. As a result, I find that the reasons given in the rejection letter do not constitute an analysis of materiality warranting the Applicant's rejection. On this basis I find that the Visa Officer's decision is not in accordance with s. 40(1)a of  
 IRPA 
 , and further, is factually erroneous.
