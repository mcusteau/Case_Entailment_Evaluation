 [46] 
  The test for a stay of proceedings, as articulated in RJR Macdonald Inc. v. Canada(Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at 334, (1994), 111 D.L.R. (4th) 385, is threefold: 
 
 
 
 1. Is there a serious question to be tried? 
 
 
 
 2. If so, will failing to grant the injunction cause irreparable harm to the applicants? 
 
 
 
 3. Does the balance of inconvenience favour granting an injunction or not? 
 
 
 
 The party seeking a stay must satisfy the Court that it meets all three branches of the test.
