 [39] 
  In the context of motions to strike where a reasonable cause of action is not at issue, the Court must be satisfied that the pleading: 
 
 
 
 (a) is immaterial or redundant, 
 
 
 
 (b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, 
 
 
 
 (c) may prejudice or delay the fair trial of the action, 
 
 
 
 (d) constitutes a departure from a previous pleading, or 
 
 
 
 (e) is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court before the Court will strike the pleading.
