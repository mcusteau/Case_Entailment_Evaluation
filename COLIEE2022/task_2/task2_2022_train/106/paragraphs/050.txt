  I would nevertheless dismiss the stay motion for failure by the Defendants to establish irreparable harm. The Defendants in this case submit that irreparable harm would be caused by the possibility that the Defendants may have to disclose confidential material to Apotex, and the possibility that Apotex may use the information learned on discovery to identify other co-defendants. In respect to protecting sensitive or confidential materials from disclosure, parties regularly employ confidentiality agreements to cover such situations. Moreover, even if it were established that sensitive information were disclosed by the discovery process, the Defendants have failed to establish how the disclosure of such evidence would lead to irreparable harm. The Defendants' allegation of irreparable harm is speculative.
