 1) An order allowing the within appeal and setting aside the order of Prothonotary Aronovitch dated August 19, 2005; 
 
 
 
 2) An order striking the amended statement of claim dated May 23, 2003, in its entirety as it applies to SPIL, without leave to amend, or, in the alternative, that should Apotex Inc. seek to amend its pleading to again add SPIL as a defendant, requiring that Apotex must satisfy the Court, with evidence, that Apotex has, since the date of this motion, obtained information to ground a reasonable basis for its factual assertions with respect to SPIL; 
 
 
 
 3) An order striking, without leave to amend, all references in the amended claim to any defendant, apart from Roche, or in the alternative, that should Apotex seek to amend its pleading to add another defendant, Apotex must satisfy the Court, with evidence, that since the date of this motion, Apotex has obtained information to ground a reasonable basis for its factual assertions with respect to such other defendant; 
 
 
 
 4) An order requiring Apotex to file a further amended statement of claim in accordance with paragraph 2 of this order within 10 days of the Court's order; 
 
 
 
 5) In the alternative, if the relief sought in paragraphs 1, 2, or 3 is refused, an order striking out paragraph 7 of the amended claim; 
 
 
 
 6) In the event this Honourable Court does not render a decision by the dates agreed to by the parties for discovery, namely, October 5 and 7, 2005, an order staying any order or obligation otherwise which requires any discovery of SPIL and discovery of Roche on paragraphs 6, 7 and 36, and any related paragraph of the amended claim, pending disposition of the present motion and, if unsuccessful, pending an appeal; 
 
 
 
 7) Costs of this motion and of the motion before Prothonotary Aronovitch; and 
 
 
 
 8) Such further and other relief as to this Honourable Court may seem just.
