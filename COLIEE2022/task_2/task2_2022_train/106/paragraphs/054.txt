 [54] 
  Apotex submits that costs on the motion should be awarded on an elevated scale by reason of the ongoing attempts by the Defendants to delay the proceeding and in particular delay discoveries. In her order of August 19, 2005, Prothonotary Aronovitch agreed with Apotex. She wrote in her endorsement to the order: 
 
 
 
 [...] Having regard to the history and particular circumstances of this case, I am inclined to agree with Apotex's view that this represents yet another attempt by the defendants to achieve, by other means, essentially the same end as their previous motions to strike and for summary judgment, and to delay discoveries.
