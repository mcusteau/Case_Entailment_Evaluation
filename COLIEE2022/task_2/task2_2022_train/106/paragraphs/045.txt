 [45] 
  The Defendants seek a stay of any order or obligation requiring discovery of the Defendants pending disposition of the present motion and, if unsuccessful, pending an appeal. Since my order in this motion will issue before the resumption of discovery examinations set for October 14, 2005, I need only consider the request for a stay pending appeal.
