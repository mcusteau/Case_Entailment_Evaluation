  I am also of the view that the evidence of Dr. Sherman and Mr. Radomski that Apotex may amend its pleadings following discovery does not amount to evidence of a fishing expedition, as alleged by the Defendants. I agree with Prothonotary Aronovitch's characterization of the process permitted by the Federal Courts Rules. "It common that in the course of discovery, facts come to light, or become known, that will occasion amendments to be made to pleadings to correct allegations. That is part of the purpose of discovery, as in many cases certain facts are more likely to be known to only one of the parties".
