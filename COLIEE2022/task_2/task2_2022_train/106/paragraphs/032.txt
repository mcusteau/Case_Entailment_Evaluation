  While Hunt v. Carey concerned a motion to strike for failure to disclose a reasonable cause of action, courts have held that the test for the other grounds to strike is at least as stringent: Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. Smithkline Beecham Pharma Inc. (1998), 158 F.T.R. 194, 86 C.P.R. (3d) 36 at para. 9. The Court will strike only in the clearest and most obvious of cases.
