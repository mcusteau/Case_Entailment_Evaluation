 [36] 
  Caterpillar, supra, and Painblanc, supra, are distinguishable from the case at bar. In Caterpillar, the defendant did not plead any material facts supporting positive allegations made in its statement of defence. The defendant, in that case, merely restated the substance of certain portions of the Patent Act. The Federal Courts Rules, those applicable then and now, provide that allegations in respect to questions of law must be supported by material facts. When the defendant was asked for particulars, it did not provide them, and on being discovered the defendant admitted that it knew of no material facts to support its allegations. The issue then became one of evidence. The Court in Caterpillar held that the defendant, in effect, admitted that it had no evidence to support the allegations.
