  Apotex advanced a number of factors on which it bases its allegation that SPIL controls Roche. Apotex points to the fact that SPIL is the owner of the '671 patent and that Roche is an exclusive licencee of that patent. Apotex submits that the very nature of the relationship between Roche and SPIL "presupposes a measure of control". Apotex points out that SPIL had to give consent to Roche (or rather, its predecessor Syntex Inc.) to list the '671 patent. Further, at the hearing, Apotex stated that SPIL was an applicant to the prohibition application by the defendants. Apotex also submits that the testimony of Mr. Radomski establishes, based on other litigation, particularly "Ketorolac Action" before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice (File No. 02-CV-22071), that Roche may be controlled by a foreign related party.
