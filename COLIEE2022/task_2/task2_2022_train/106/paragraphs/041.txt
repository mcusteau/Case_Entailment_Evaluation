  I am of the view that the evidence of Dr. Sherman and Mr. Radomski is insufficient to establish a lack of evidentiary foundation for the material facts pleaded. It is not disputed that SPIL is the holder of the '671 patent, that it was an applicant in the prohibition proceeding; and that it gave consent to Roche to list the patent. As well, and in particular, SPIL has an exclusive licensing agreement with Roche. These factors establish a sufficient factual basis for the material facts pleaded in respect to SPIL's alleged control over and common enterprise with Roche.
