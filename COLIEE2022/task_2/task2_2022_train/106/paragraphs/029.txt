  Motions to strike pleadings are governed by Rule 221 of the Federal Court Rules: 
 
 
 
 221. (1) Motion to strike - On motion, the Court may, at any time, order that a pleading, or anything contained therein, be struck out, with or without leave to amend, on the ground that it 
 
 
 
 (a) discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be, 
 
 
 
 (b) is immaterial or redundant, 
 
 
 
 (c) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, 
 
 
 
 (d) may prejudice or delay the fair trial of the action, 
 
 
 
 (e) constitutes a departure from a previous pleading, or 
 
 
 
 (f) is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court, 
 
 
 
 and may order the action be dismissed or judgment entered accordingly. 
 
 
 
 (2) Evidence - No evidence shall be heard on a motion for an order under paragraph (1)(a).
