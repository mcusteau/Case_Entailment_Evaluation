 [19] 
  In this appeal, the Defendants raise the following issues: 
 
 
 
 1) Should the Court strike Apotex's amended claim as it applies to SPIL, in whole or in part, or as it applies to any defendant other than Roche? 
 
 
 
 2) Should the Court strike paragraph 7 of Apotex's amended claim? 
 
 
 
 3) Should the Court stay the discovery process if the decision of the Court is not rendered by the date set for the discovery of the Defendants?
