 [43] 
  In respect of the Defendants' alternative relief that paragraph 7 of Apotex's amended claim be struck as irrelevant, I agree with the Prothonotary that the wording is not "plain and obvious" as to not encompass the relevant time frame of Apotex's underlying action. In my opinion, the Defendants' reason for wanting paragraph 7 struck is not to limit Apotex's discovery to a relevant time frame, but rather to remove the basis of Apotex's cause of action against SPIL.
