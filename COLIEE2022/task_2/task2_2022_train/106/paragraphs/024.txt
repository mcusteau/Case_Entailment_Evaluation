  The Defendants also submit that the vagueness in the responses of H.B. Radomski on cross-examination show that Apotex does not have any evidence upon which it could support its pleadings in respect to SPIL. The Defendants point to Mr. Radomski's statements that Apotex may not have named the right controlling entity and may have to amend its pleadings, and that Mr. Radomski has no personal knowledge of any kind of "parental control" in the case of naproxen. In challenging his testimony about similar litigation, the Defendants submit that Mr.Radomski was unable to provide "a single factual example where there was an issue where the Canadian company indicated in some explicit way that it could not proceed until approval was obtained from a foreign parent".
