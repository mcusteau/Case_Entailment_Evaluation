  It is trite law that the Board, in assessing a claimant's credibility, may reject testimony if it does not tally with the balance of probabilities that characterize the case as a whole, and may refer to rationality and common sense, as was held in  
 Antonippillai v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration) 
 , [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 156; [1999] F.C.J. No. 382 (T.D.), at paragraph 9: 
 
 
 
 "There is no question that the Board has all the necessary discretion to assess the credibility of the testimony of people who claim refugee status, and may have regard to a multitude of factors in so doing. The Board may base its findings on internal contradictions, inconsistencies and evasive statements, which are the 'heartland of the discretion of triers of fact', and other extrinsic factors such as rationality, common sense and judicial notice, but those findings must not be made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the Board:  
 Sbitty v. Canada (M.C.I.) 
 , (IMM-4668-96, December 12, 1997),  
 Shahamati v. M.E.I.
