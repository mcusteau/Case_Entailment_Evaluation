  Similarly, in  
 Ahmad v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2004] F.T.R. Uned. A88; [2004] F.C.J. No. 995; 2004 FC 808, at paragraph 22, Mr. Justice Paul Rouleau noted: 
 
 
 
 "Thus the assessment of the applicant's fear must be made in concreto, and not from an abstract and general perspective. The fact that the documentary evidence illustrates unequivocally the systematic and generalized violation of human rights in Pakistan is simply not sufficient to establish the specific and individualized fear of persecution of the applicant in particular. Absent the least proof that might link the general documentary evidence to the applicant's specific circumstances, I conclude that the Board did not err in the way it analyzed the applicant's claim under section 97."
