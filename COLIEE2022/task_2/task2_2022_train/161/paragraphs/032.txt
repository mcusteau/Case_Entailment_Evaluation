  The Board did not believe that Mr. Toora was arrested in India in February 1997 or that he was wanted by the police since he had no problems with the police between February 25, 1997 and his departure in August 1997, other than an incident of harassment where the police had allegedly questioned him as a person of lower caste and demanded that he come out of his house. He obtained an American visa in New Delhi on March 3, 1997, remained in India until August 1997 and was able to leave his country without any problem. He also confirmed that he was not wanted by the police (Reasons for decision, at page 3).
