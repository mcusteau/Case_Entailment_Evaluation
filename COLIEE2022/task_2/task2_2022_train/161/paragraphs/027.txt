  Failure to claim the protection of a foreign state at the first opportunity may affect a claimant's credibility, even in respect of incidents having occurred in his country of origin. In  
 Assadi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 136; [1997] F.C.J. No. 331 (T.D.), at paragraphs 13-14, Mr. Justice Teitelbaum held: 
 
 
 
 "The Board gave its negative findings with respect to the applicant's credibility in clear and unequivocal terms, citing numerous examples or illustrations for why it had not accepted the applicant's testimony:  
 Brar v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration) 
  (May 29, 1986), A-987-84 (F.C.A.), [1986] F.C.J. No. 346 (Q.L.). 
 
 
 
 "Take, as an example, the Board's interpretation of the applicant's Spanish interlude. The Board cited  
 Ilie v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
  (1994), 88 F.T.R. 220, a case directly on point about the expectation that a claimant would seek refuge in a country that is a signatory to the  
 International Convention 
 . Failure to immediately seek protection can impugn the claimant's credibility, including his or her testimony about events in his country of origin...."
