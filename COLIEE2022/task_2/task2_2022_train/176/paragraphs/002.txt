  The applicants are Jewish Russians. The male applicant worked as a moulder in a Moscow factory from 1950 to 1989 and the female applicant as an engineer in an electronics company in Moscow from 1961 to 1989.

As a result of this departure, the male applicant was fired from his job because his employers believed that he would apply for an exit visa to go to Israel.
