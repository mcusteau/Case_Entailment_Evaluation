Ms. Dazé said in July 1998, Revenue Canada obtained financial disclosure information provided to the annual meeting of DBC shareholders to be held on March 30, 1998. That material disclosed the compensation paid to senior management. It indicated Mr. Marengère was in receipt of bonuses and exercised stock options for the years 1995 and 1996. Revenue Canada compared this information with T-2 filed by Services MLM. Ms. Dazé stated in her affidavit that Services MLM had failed to declare revenues in the order of $1,483,074 for the years 1995, 1996 and 1997.
