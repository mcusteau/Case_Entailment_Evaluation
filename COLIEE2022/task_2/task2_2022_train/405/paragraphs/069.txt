Objectively viewed, in terms of the effect or results of Services MLM actions, it is plain and obvious to me that the Minister had more than reasonable grounds for believing the collection of the amounts assessed were in jeopardy by the passage of time. The facts clearly show that Services MLM's assets were a very long way from being able to cover the amounts assessed or reassessed and that its most valuable asset, its share in the settlement proceeds, had been assigned by it to Wellgate, an offshore company with no assets, no operations or bank account in Canada and in which its controlling shareholder, Mr. Marengère, also had an important if not a determinative say in how Wellgate acted. For purposes of jeopardy collection, on the evidence, it has been shown by Revenue Canada that Wellgate and Services MLM are essentially one and the same entities notwithstanding other participants in Wellgate, namely, Nicolas Matossian and René Amyot and notwithstanding the original purpose of Wellgate or its purported role in the settlement proceeds. Passage of time was imminent because the payment of the settlement funds, through or via Wellgate, was scheduled for March 15, 1999, the day on which the ex parte jeopardy order was authorized. I am satisfied for the purpose of receiving the settlement proceeds from DBC Wellgate was the
alter ego
of the beneficiaries of those proceeds and, in this case, Services MLM in particular.
