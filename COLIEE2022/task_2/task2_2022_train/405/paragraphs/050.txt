Mr. Marengère says this at paragraph 25 of his main affidavit:
"25. As part of the Settlement Agreement, it was contemplated that the settlement proceeds would be returned as a loan to Dominion Bridge Group. As a result, it was agreed that the promise of payment take the form of an 18-month term loan evidence by a promissory note to be issued or assigned to Wellgate International Ltd., which would be subject to the Credit Agreement ... This manner of 'payment' is set out at paragraph 3 of the Settlement Agreement. It was further contemplated that the payment would be lent back to Dominion Bridge Group by means of the promissory note the whole as appears from the Credit Agreement produced as exhibit 'E' to the Dazé affidavit. I note that the Credit Agreement produced by Mme Dazé as exhibit 'E' does not include exhibit 'B' thereto. Attached as exhibit 'F' to this my affidavit is a copy of exhibit 'B' which should have been attached to Mrs. Dazé's version of the Credit Agreement. This document will hereinafter be referred to as the 'Wellgate note'."
