I think it is clear that the purpose of paragraph 6(1)(a) is to include in the taxable income of a taxpayer those economic benefits arising from his employment which render the taxpayer's salary of greater value to him. I am persuaded that if there was a recipient of any alleged benefit which may have arisen from the circumstances of this case, it was certainly not the plaintiff taxpayer. I cannot equate it to an economic advantage such as free board and lodging which is mentioned in paragraph 6(1)(a).
