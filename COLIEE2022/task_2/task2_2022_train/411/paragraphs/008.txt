The Crown has taken the position that the entire amount of the Air Traffic Control Linguistic Relocation Allowance constituted taxable income in the hands of the taxpayer for the 1976 taxation year. To buttress that contention, Crown counsel advanced three main arguments. He argued that the sum paid to the plaintiff amounted to "other remuneration" within the meaning of subsection 5(1) of the Income Tax Act ("the Act") which provides:
"5.(1) Income from office or employment - Subject to this Part, a taxpayer's income for a taxation year from an office or employment is the salary, wages and other remuneration, including gratuities, received by him in the year."
