Following a three-month study by a Special Task Force, Treasury Board authorized a relocation payment which was dubbed "Air Traffic Control Linguistic Relocation Allowance". Two aspects of compensation were intended. The first, termed Accommodation Differential, assumed from the Special Task Force report that the purchase of similar accommodation in another major metropolitan centre would be costlier and would result in an increased mortgage. This payment was to lessen the impact of the cost of accommodation brought about by increases in mortgage costs; it was defined as follows:
"- an annual payment for a period not to exceed the five years to cover only the identified increases in mortgage costs at the new place of duty based on the cost of interest, at recognized current mortgage rates, when applied solely to the difference in the appraised value or the sales price of the controller's accommodation in Montreal and the assessed value of similar accommodation at the new place of duty by applying residential market costs reported quarterly by nation-wide reputable real estate firms."
