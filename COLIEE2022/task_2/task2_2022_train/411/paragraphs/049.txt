It will be recalled that there were two aspects to the Air Traffic Control Linguistic Relocation "Allowance". Throughout my reasons for judgment, I have only dealt with the Accommodation Differential, which, by virtue of the above, I conclude is not to be computed in the plaintiff's taxable income, be it as "other remuneration", "deemed remuneration", another "benefit of any kind whatever" or as an "allowance for any other purpose" within the intendment of subsections 5(1) and 6(3) and paragraphs 6(1)(a) and (b) of the Act, respectively. As far as the second aspect of the "allowance" is concerned, that is the Social Disruption "Allowance", in the absence of any proof put forward by the plaintiff to show that he actually suffered other losses due to his relocation equal to the $2,155. 41 he received, I must conclude that a benefit accrued to him within the meaning of paragraph 6(1)(a) of the Act. Such amount did not constitute remuneration under subsection 5(1), deemed remuneration for the purposes of subsection 6(3), or an allowance within the purview of paragraph 6(1)(b) for the same reasons as the Accommodation Differential does not come under the above provisions.
