It is clear to me that on the facts in Savage there was no element of gift, personal bounty or of consideration extraneous to the taxpayer's employment. The Court was satisfied that the award of $300 for having successfully completed a course recommended by the company was "in accordance with company policy ... designed to provide a broad understanding of modern life insurance ... to encourage self-upgrading of staff members ... make for a more valuable employee ... more efficient in the company business and for better opportunity for promotion." These words clearly imply that, though some relation between the payment and employment are inevitable, the primary purpose of the allowance, in order to qualify as exempt, must be completely extraneous to the employment and the amount should not constitute a benefit either to the employer or to the employee in relation to the employment. In the case before me the payment was to the taxpayer in his capacity as a person. The employee had no choice in accepting the transfer. The motivation was political and was brought about by a labour dispute. The transfer to Ottawa was involuntary and certainly did not improve traffic safety at the Ottawa International Airport. The payment of this sum cannot be related to company policy, to providing greater understanding of air traffic control or better understanding of company operations, to upgrading the staff member, to making the taxpayer a more valuable employee nor did it create an opportunity for promotion.
