In Savage, supra, the Court in distinguishing the Phaneuf case, supra, wrote as follows at p. 5414:
"It is difficult to conclude that the payments by Excelsior to Mrs. Savage were not in relation to or in connection with her employment. As Mr. Justice Grant said, the employee took the course to improve his or her knowledge and efficiency in the company business and for better opportunity of promotion.
"As Crown counsel submits, the sum of $300 received by Mrs. Savage from her employer was a benefit and was received or enjoyed by her in respect of, in the course of or by virtue of her employment within the meaning of s. 6(1)(a) of the the Income Tax Act; it was paid by her employer in accordance with company policy upon the successful completion of courses 'designed to provide a broad understanding of modern life insurance and life insurance company operations' and 'to encourage self-upgrading of staff members'; the interest of the employer 'was that the courses would make her a more valuable employee'; Mrs. Savage took the courses to 'improve [her] knowledge and efficiency in the company business and for better opportunity for promotion'. Distinguishing this case from Phaneuf, there was no element of gift, personal bounty or of considerations extraneous to Mrs. Savage's employment.
"I would hold that the payments received by Mrs. Savage were in respect of employment. That, of itself, makes them income from a source under s. 3 of the Act."
