Rouleau, J.
: This is an appeal from a decision of the Tax Review Board delivered on March 12, 1982. The plaintiff, an air traffic controller, was employed by Transport Canada at the Air Traffic Control Tower at Dorval Airport until placed on a transfer roster requiring him to leave on July 1, 1977. He, in fact, relocated to the Ottawa International Airport earlier, on December 31, 1976. The official reason for the plaintiff's transfer was stated to be accelerated implementation of bilingualization in the air traffic control towers in Quebec where, until then, the official working language had been English. The issue to be determined concerns the tax liability of a payment made by the employer to the taxpayer termed "Air Traffic Control Linguistic Relocation Allowance."
