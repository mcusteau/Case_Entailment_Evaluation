  I agree with the respondent that  
 Zolotareva 
  is distinguishable. First,  
 Zolotareva 
  did not find a requirement for PRRA officers to consider H & C factors, but that it was permissible for the PRRA officer in that case to represent the Minister for the purpose of the H & C application as well as the PRRA assessment. In that case, the officer was performing the assessment of both applications. Here, there is no evidence of a separate H & C application, let alone that such an application was before the officer.
