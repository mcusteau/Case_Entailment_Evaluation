  The transitional provisions of the  
 IRP Regulations 
  specify which people will continue to be considered refugees under  
 IRPA 
 :  
 Regulations 
  s. 338. Mr. Kim does not fit the definition of a person whose refugee status will continue to be recognized under  
 IRPA 
 . Members of the Indochinese Designated Class were exempt from s. 7 of the old  
 Regulations 
  and could not have applied under s. 4 of the  
 Humanitarian Designated Class Regulations 
 , as these came into force in 1997 at the same time as the Indochinese Designated Class was repealed.
