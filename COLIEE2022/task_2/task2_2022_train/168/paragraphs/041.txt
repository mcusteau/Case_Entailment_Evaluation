  The most persuasive part of Mr. Kim's argument, it seems to me, is the idea that once recognized by the UNHCR as a refugee, he should be recognized internationally as such, including by the Government of Canada. The UNHCR Statute definition that creates the concept of mandate refugees is nearly identical to the Refugee Convention definition. Although they are substantially similar, mandate refugees are not treated in the same way as Convention refugees under Canadian law and this is, arguably, not fair.
