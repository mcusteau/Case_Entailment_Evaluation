  Although the Indochinese Designated Class ceased to exist in 1997, neither the

 Barry and Brosseau v. Alberta Securities Commission 
 , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 301; 93 N.R. 1; 96 A.R. 241. The rights in issue are fundamental human rights and so the presumption that there was no change is even stronger:  
 Mercure v. Saskatchewan 
 , [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234; 83 N.R. 81; 65 Sask.R. 1.
