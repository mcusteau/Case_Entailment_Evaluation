  The issues raised on this judicial review fall into different categories. The first question is whether the PRRA officer had jurisdiction to do an assessment of Mr. Kim's case for protection. This is clearly a question of law, as is the determination of the appropriate legal standard, the second issue. The third issue goes to the assessment of evidence. This is a factual determination. The fourth and fifth questions require an assessment of whether a particular law is applicable to Mr. Kim's situation. While this is ultimately a question of mixed fact and law, there must be a preliminary determination of what the law pertaining to cruel and unusual treatment and to s. 25 of  
 IRPA 
  actually is before it can be applied to the facts as found.
