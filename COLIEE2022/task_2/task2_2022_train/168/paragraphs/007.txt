  The following issues were argued before me: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the PRRA officer err in determining that Mr. Kim was not a person described in s. 115(1) of  
 IRPA 
  and that she had jurisdiction to make the assessment? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the PRRA officer err in applying the wrong legal standard in determining risk? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the PRRA officer err in ignoring significant evidence? 
 
 
 
 4. Did the PRRA officer err in failing to consider humanitarian and compassionate circumstances of the applicant in her assessment of whether Mr. Kim would suffer cruel and unusual treatment in being removed? 
 
 
 
 5. Did the PRRA officer err in failing to consider and make a determination under s. 25 of  
 IRPA 
 ?
