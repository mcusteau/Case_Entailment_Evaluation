  As noted by Justice Martineau in  
 Umba v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2004), 257 F.T.R. 169 (F.C.), in the context of Refugee Protection Board hearings at para. 25: 
 
 
 
 "[T]he establishment of Convention refugee status or the status of a 'person in need of protection' pursuant to ss. 96 and 97 of the  
 Act 
  is based on specific requirements that must be established by the claimant. Thus, the application of these provisions is directly related to the personal situation of each claimant and the particular conditions of the country in question at the time that the claim for asylum or protection is brought before the Board. In practice, it is therefore clear that the determination of the status of 'refugee' or of a 'person in need of protection' does not depend on 'the consideration of numerous interests simultaneously, and the promulgation of solutions which concurrently balance benefits and costs for many different parties'. In my opinion, it is more a decision establishing the rights between the parties [...] than it is a polycentric decision." 
 
 
 
 I agree with this analysis. Balancing competing policy concerns ought not enter into a PRRA analysis any more than a Refugee Protection Board analysis. This factor points towards less deference.
