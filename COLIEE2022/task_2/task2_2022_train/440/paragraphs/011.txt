The principal applicant was advised that the documentation he had provided and displayed was not satisfactory. He was requested to obtain other identification docu­ments such as an original marriage certificate or a birth certificate. He was advised that his record of landing would be issued only upon provision of satisfactory identification. This, some 39 or 40 months after his application for landing and more than two years after the notarized copy of the passport was pro­vided to the respondent.
