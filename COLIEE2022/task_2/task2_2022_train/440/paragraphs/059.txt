[59]
Against the foregoing guidance, I am satisfied that the first question proposed on behalf of the respondent, with one modification, warrants certification. Relief in the nature of certiorari is not the only relief that will be granted in this matter and thus, if the question were related only to relief in the nature of certiorari, as proposed on behalf of the respondent, arguably at least, the answer to the question would not be dispositive of an appeal. The words "or any other form" will be added after the word "certiorari".
