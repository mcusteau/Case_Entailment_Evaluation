In
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
[see footnote 7], Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, in the context of an application for landing from within Canada on humanitarian and compas­sionate grounds, wrote at p. 848:
"In my opinion, it is now appropriate to recognize that, in certain circumstances, the duty of procedural fairness will require the provision of a written explanation for a decision. The strong arguments demon­strating the advantages of written reasons suggest that, in cases such as this where the decision has important significance for the individual, when there is statutory right of appeal, or in other circumstances, some form of reasons should be required. This requirement has been developing in the common law elsewhere. The circumstances of the case at bar, in my opinion constitute one of the situations where reasons are necessary. The profound importance of an H&C decision to those affected, ... mili­tates in favour of a requirement that rea­sons be provided. It would be unfair for a person subject to a decision such as this one which is so critical to their future not to be told why the result was reached." (citations omitted)
