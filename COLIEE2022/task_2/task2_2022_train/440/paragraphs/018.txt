On the 22nd of June, 1999, more than four months after this application for judicial review was filed, the respondent wrote to the principal applicant, in part in the following terms:
"This refers to your application for perma­nent residence. Although you were eligible to apply as a Convention Refugee, further processing of your application is not pos­sible.
"Section 46.04(8) of The Immigration Act states that landing shall not be granted until the applicant is in possession of a valid and subsisting passport, travel docu­ment or satisfactory identity document.
"The identity document you have sub­mitted does not meet the requirement of 46.04(8) of The Immigration Act. As you are unable to comply with this require­ment, we have suspended processing of your application for permanent residence.
. . . . .
"If, at some time in the future, you feel you are able to comple (sic) with the re­quirements of 46.04(8), please provide Etobicoke CIC with the original passport, travel or identity document and we will review it."
In addition, the letter advises the principal applicant regarding the Undocumented Con­vention refugee in Canada Class (the "UCRCC") and of the process for applying as a member of that class.
