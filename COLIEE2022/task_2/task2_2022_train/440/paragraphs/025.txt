The foregoing background, context and brief commentary on the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement indicates, to this judge at least, that the respondent has demonstrated a remarkably cavalier attitude toward the hardships that the principal applicant and his family members have been enduring. Com足munication with the principal applicant would appear to have been less than full and open. Identity documents thought to be less than adequate were never sent for verifica足tion when they should have been and were alleged to have been. The difference in philosophy demonstrated in the communica足tion from a visa officer in the respondent's ministry in Islamabad from the philosophy reflected in the actions or inactions of officers in the same ministry here in Canada appears to have been dramatic. I am left with the firm impression that if this application for judicial review had not been initiated on behalf of the principal applicant and his family members, many of the potential embarrassments for the respondent's offi足cials, and perhaps indeed for the respondent herself, might have gone unnoticed.
