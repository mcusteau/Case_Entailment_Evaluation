By decision dated the 15th of November, 1994, the principal applicant, who alleges he is a citizen of Afghanistan, was determined by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board to be a Convention refugee as against Afghanistan. Apparently at that time, and at all times since, the principal applicant's wife and children, the other applicants herein, have been residing in Pakistan under what the principal applicant attests to be "deplorÂ­able conditions". The principal applicant is in his mid-fifty's. As at the 30th of March, 1999, he was a student here in Canada.
