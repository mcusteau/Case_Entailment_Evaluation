As noted earlier in these reasons, the applicant was advised by letter dated the 23rd of January, 1996 that additional identity documentation was required. A copy of a passport was specifically identified as appro­priate identity documentation. The principal applicant applied through the Afghan Consu­late General in New York City for an Afghan passport and obtained one. It was valid from the 11th of March, 1996 to the 10th of March, 1997. Counsel for the appli­cant forwarded a notarized copy of the passport to the respondent under cover of a letter dated the 21st of March, 1996, clearly at a time when the passport was "subsisting".
