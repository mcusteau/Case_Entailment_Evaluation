In the result, I will set aside the decisions of the respondent to reject the valid and subsisting passport submitted by the principal applicant and the various other identity documents submitted by him other than his identity booklet and marriage certificate. Those decisions will be referred back to the respondent for redetermination in accordance with law as interpreted in these reasons. I will order return to the principal applicant of the identity documents submitted by him and still in the respondent's possession, however suspect they may or may not be. In addition, I will provide a declaration in the terms set out earlier in these reasons.
