The principal applicant was further advised through a staff member in the office of a Member of Parliament, in early Octo­ber, 1998, about the seizure of his docu­ments and about the respondent's concerns with those documents. The staff member apparently advised the respondent by letter dated the 28th of October, 1998 that rela­tives of the principal applicant were willing to attest to his identity. Apparently no response was received. Nonetheless, the principal applicant forwarded to the respon­dent an affidavit sworn by his brother attest­ing to the principal applicant's identity. No acknowledgement of receipt of this affidavit was provided.
