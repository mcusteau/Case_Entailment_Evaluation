While it is true that the burden of proof may fall on different parties depending on whether the complaint is processed under the
Canada Labour
Code
or the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
, and that the certain principles of labour law may be more difficult to plead in the context of proceedings under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
(an issue on which I take no position), these considerations have little to do with the relevant issue: are both complaints essentially the same?
