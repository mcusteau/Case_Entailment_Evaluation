On costs, I note that the Respondent has been largely successful in this judicial review. However, an important aspect of the adjudicator's decision has nevertheless been found in error. In this respect, the results of these proceedings may be said to be mixed. Consequently I will exercise my discretion under the
Federal Courts Rules
and make no order as to costs.
