After this notice of hearing on her
Canada Labour
Code
complaint was sent out, the Applicant submitted another complaint to the Canadian Human Rights Commission dated May 28, 2009. In a detailed three-page narrative in her complaint addressed to the Commission, the Applicant made, in particular, the following submissions (Exhibit 5 of the affidavit of Eric Rowley at pages 35 and 37 of the Respondent's record):
"I have reasonable grounds to believe that I have been discriminated against. I declare the following to be true to the best of my knowledge.
"My name is Wanda Irene MacFarlane and my complaint is against Day & Ross Inc. I am 62 years old and I have been diagnosed with clinical depression, fibromyalgia, and migraine. I believe that I have been discriminated against on the bases both of my age and my disability.
. . . . .
"On July 4 2008 I was terminated, retroactively, by hand delivered letter, having been disabled since May 23rd 2008. I believe that increasing my exposure to applications known to increase my disability until I was no longer able to function, denying me disability insurance, and terminating my employment while I am disabled citing errors made as a result of this known disability constitute discrimination on the basis of disability."
