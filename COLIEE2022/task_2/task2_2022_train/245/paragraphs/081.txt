This principle extends to adjudication of disputes under section 242 of the
Canada Labour
Code
. Indeed, though the adjudicator under that
Code
is reviewing an employer's decision to terminate the employment relationship under the employee's individual contract of employment rather than under a collective agreement, the same authority to enforce an employer's obligation to exercise its management rights in accordance with the statutory provisions is implicitly included in that individual contract of employment. If we simply replace the phrase "collective agreement" by "individual contract of employment" in the above comments made in
Parry Sound
, we clearly have the principles applicable in this case.
