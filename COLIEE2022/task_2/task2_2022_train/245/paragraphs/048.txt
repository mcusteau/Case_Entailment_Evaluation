That same day, by email dated August 19, 2009 1:05 pm (Exhibit 22 to the affidavit of Eric Rowley page 275 of Respondent's record), the adjudicator added that he "will hear submissions on your request to bifurcate the hearing, but unless convinced to do so, I would expect the hearing to proceed on the merits." Again, he thereby clearly notified both parties that the submissions on bifurcation would be heard with those on jurisdiction.
