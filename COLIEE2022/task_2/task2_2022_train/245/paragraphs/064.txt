Within this corpus of decisions by adjudicators, two distinct lines of cases are found. A number of adjudicators, such as in
Mundo Peetabeck Education Authority and Wade
, supra, at paras. 19 and 20, have declined to decide a
Canada Labour
Code
complaint where a similar complaint under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
is pending, though they assert residual jurisdiction to decide the complaint should the matter be referred for adjudication under the
Code
by the Canadian Human Rights Commission pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
. However, other adjudicators, such as in
Tse v. Federal Express Canada Ltd.
, supra, at paras. 41 and 44, have decided that they had absolutely no jurisdiction over dismissal complaints involving allegations of human rights violations under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
. In the present case, the adjudicator followed the latter line and declined jurisdiction in such a manner as to preclude the Canadian Human Rights Commission from referring the matter back to him under paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
.
