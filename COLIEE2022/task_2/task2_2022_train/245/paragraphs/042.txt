The Respondent responds that, in fact, the Applicant had no difficulties hearing the proceedings and that she actively participated and intervened at all stages of the proceedings. The Respondent has also offered an affidavit in evidence in support of this. In his affidavit, at paragraphs 30 to 33, Eric Rowley declares that the hearing was held in a room facing a skating rink located in the civic centre where the proceedings were being conducted. At the beginning of the hearing, the Applicant indicated she had difficulty hearing counsel for the Respondent because of noise from the rink. Consequently, the small window was thus closed and the adjudicator requested counsel to speak in a louder voice, which he did. After this initial complaint, the Applicant never raised again any new complaint concerning the conduct of the meeting or claimed she had have difficulties hearing the proceedings; indeed, she is said to have taken an active part in the hearing.
