Following a request from the Respondent for a reconsideration of his decision to proceed with the hearing, the adjudicator responded as follows by email dated August 19, 2009, 8:34 am (Exhibit 20 of the affidavit of Eric Rowley, at page 269 of the Respondent's record):
"I have received and read your response document, but in order to ensure fairness in this proceeding it is my view that the hearing must proceed. I note that you refer to certain documents in the company's Book of Documents. As you are aware, at this time I have received the Book of Documents, but I am not aware of whether or not the complainant has received it, and what her position is with respect to it being before me as evidence. In my view, the only way in which the preliminary matter can [b]e addressed, let alone the merits of the matter, is to continue with the hearing and that is what I have decided. The essence of your objection has an evidentiary basis, and at this time I have no evidence before me.
"Both parties are to attend at the hearing as per the Notice of Hearing sent by myself earlier this year and be prepared to raise any preliminary objections. At that time I will address any preliminary matters and decide whether or not to proceed on the merits. I would expect that both parties would be prepared to proceed on the merits if needed."
