[84]
In conclusion, I rule that the adjudicator did not violate any principles of natural justice or procedural fairness in conducting the proceedings and rendering his decision. I also rule that the adjudicator correctly decided not to hear the complaint before him on the merits. Consequently, the decision of the adjudicator in this case is largely upheld, save to the extent that the adjudicator declined jurisdiction in a manner which would preclude the complaint being referred back to him by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in the exercise of its authority pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
