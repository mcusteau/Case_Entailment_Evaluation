[24]
The Respondent asserts that no breach to procedural fairness or to the principles of natural justice occurred in this case. In response to the Applicant's allegation that she was unable to follow the hearing, it is claimed that she made only one comment on this matter at the beginning of the hearing, and that the adjudicator remedied the situation appropriately. The Applicant did not raise the issue after the adjudicator had corrected the situation, and her failure to object after assistance had already been provided is fatal to her argument. Moreover, the Applicant actively participated in the hearing; it can thus be inferred that she could and did hear the proceedings.
