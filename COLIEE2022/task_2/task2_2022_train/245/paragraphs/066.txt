I will begin my analysis with
Sagkeeng Alcohol Rehab Centre Inc. v. Abraham et al.
, [1994] 3 F.C. 449; 79 F.T.R. 53; [1994] F.C.J. No. 640 (T.D.). In that case, both a complaint of unfair dismissal under the
Canada Labour
Code
and a complaint alleging discrimination pursuant to the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
had been filed by the complainant. The adjudicator under the
Code
had nevertheless assumed jurisdiction over the complaint, and this was challenged by way of a judicial review application on the ground that paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Code
precluded the adjudicator from proceeding. Rothstein, J., ruled that the adjudicator did have jurisdiction as follows (at para. 23 of the decision):
"[...] With respect to remedy, a brief review of section 53 of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
and subsection 242(4) of the
Canada Labour
Code
indicates that the statutory provisions, although not identical in wording, appear in substance to be similar. However, again, a body of jurisprudence has developed in respect of each type of remedy and it is not clear, at this stage, that the procedures under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
and the
Canada Labour
Code
would yield the exact same remedy. For these reasons, and because I do not have sufficient information before me as to the similarities and differences between the respondents' unjust dismissal complaints and human rights complaints, I find that the Adjudicator did not err in concluding that paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
was not a bar to his jurisdiction in this case."
