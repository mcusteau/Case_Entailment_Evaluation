Under paragraph 242(3)(a) of the
Canada Labour
Code
, an adjudicator must "consider whether the dismissal of the person who made the complaint was unjust and render a decision thereon". Surely a dismissal made in violation of an employee's human rights is "unjust" within the meaning of that provision of the
Code
, and I fail to understand why an adjudicator could not so find. Obviously, the decision of the adjudicator in such a case is made under the relevant provisions of the
Canada Labour
Code
, and the remedial measures which the adjudicator can order are those set out in that
Code
and not those provided for in other legislation such as the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. However, the concept of "unjust dismissal" is not such as to foreclose any consideration of motives for dismissal based on violations of human rights where an adjudicator is properly referred a matter pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
.
