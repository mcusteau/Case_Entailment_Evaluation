  Counsel for the respondent, who I understand also spoke for the Review Tribunal, argued his case on the basis that the new appeal provisions under s. 82(1), which came into force on December 31, 1991, are applicable to the case at hand. This, I believe, is the correct view as the appeal was launched on January 29, 1992, that is after the coming into force of the amendment.
