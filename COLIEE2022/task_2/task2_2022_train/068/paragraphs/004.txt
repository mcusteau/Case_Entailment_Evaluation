  Faced with this, applicant, on January 29, 1992, appealed under s. 82(1) of the  
 Act 
  the Minister's refusal to amend or rescind the original decision to the Review Tribunal. By letter dated 25 March 1992, the same appeals officer advised applicant that she had no right to appeal to the Review Tribunal because: 
 
 
 
 "Please note that the decision which is to be rescinded or amended is the decision that was made in September, 1987, as no other decisions were made with respect to the 1987 application. Our medical advisers reviewed the documentation you submitted; however, it was considered that no new facts were presented to warrant the reopening of Mrs. Peplinski's case; consequently, the September, 1987, decision could not be changed. 
 
 
 
 "If, as a result of the consideration under s. 84(2), the 1987 decision had been amended, and if, upon being notified of the new decision, you had been dissatisfied with that new decision, then the new decision made pursuant to s. 84(2), could have been appealed under s. 82(1). This, however, is not the case in this instance. Since no new decision could be made, there is nothing to appeal."
