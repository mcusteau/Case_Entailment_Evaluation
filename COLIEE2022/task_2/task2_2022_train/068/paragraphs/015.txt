  Furthermore, and more importantly, the power of the Commission to reconsider prior claims is not contingent upon the existence of new facts. The Commission has unlimited authority under s. 57 to revisit prior claims. Changes in policy, a departure in the interpretation of benefit provisions, an administrative error, or a reconsideration of the facts underlying the original claim are all valid grounds for review. In fact, nothing as such prevents the Commission from revisiting a prior claim where nothing has changed, in the expectation that the discretion underlying the original decision may perhaps be exercised differently. In these circumstances, it cannot be said with certainty that, as Marceau, J., put it, a "genuine review decision" is rendered unless the original decision is actually altered.
