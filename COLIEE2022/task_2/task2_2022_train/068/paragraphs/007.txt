 [7] 
  Prior to December 31, 1991, no statutory appeal lied from a ministerial decision under s. 84(2). Section 82(1) now provides: 
 
 
 
 "An applicant or beneficiary or his spouse, former spouse or estate who is dissatisfied with a decision of the Minister under s. 81 or subs. 84(2) or, subject to the regulations, any person on his behalf, may appeal from the Minister's decision to a Review Tribunal within ninety days after the day on which he is notified in prescribed manner of the Minister's decision, or within such longer period as the Minister may allow." 
 
 
 
 Section 84(2) provides: 
 
 
 
 "The Minister, a Review Tribunal or the Pension Appeals Board may, notwithstanding subs. (1), on new facts, rescind or amend a decision under this Act given by him, the Tribunal or the Board, as the case may be."
