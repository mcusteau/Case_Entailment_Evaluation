  Mr. Wilson has made a number of allegations of unfair treatment on the part of the CSC. These include the alleged unfairness of the inclusion of hearsay evidence in his institutional file, and the claim that the errors in his file rendered Mr. Wilson's two parole hearings unfair. It is important, however, to keep in mind that what is relevant in this application for judicial review is the fairness of the process that was followed in relation to the processing of Grievance #21120.
