  In the meantime, on August 9, 2010, Mr. Wilson filed a first level grievance (Grievance #21120). This grievance led to the third level decision at issue in this application for judicial review. In Grievance #21120, Mr. Wilson requested that Complaint #21016, and a second complaint relating to a reduction in his pay (Complaint #21015), be combined and addressed together as a first level grievance, rather than as complaints, as they both involved allegations of harassment and discrimination.
