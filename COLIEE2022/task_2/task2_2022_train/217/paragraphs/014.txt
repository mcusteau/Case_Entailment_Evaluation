  Assistant Commissioner McCowan determined that no further action was necessary in response to Mr. Wilson's grievance. He noted that Mr. Wilson had not repeated the substantive issue raised by his original grievance, namely, whether his two earlier complaints should be combined and treated as harassment or discrimination grievances. Assistant Commissioner McCowan understood this to mean that Mr. Wilson was satisfied with the response he had received in this regard at the second level of the grievance process.
