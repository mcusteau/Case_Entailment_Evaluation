  Mr. Wilson appealed the first level decision in Grievance #21120 to the second level of the grievance process. He reiterated his allegation that the conduct identified in his two earlier complaints constituted harassment and discrimination, noting that the issue in Complaint #21016 was the sharing of information by the CSC and inaccurate information in his institutional files.
