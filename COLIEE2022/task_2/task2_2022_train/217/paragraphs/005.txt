  On August 3, 2010, Mr. Wilson filed a complaint (not a grievance) alleging that the CSC had failed to transfer a proper information package to community residential centres for their consideration, contrary to the policy set out in a Commissioner's Directive (Complaint #21016). In particular, Mr. Wilson complains that the package did not contain a psychological assessment, but did include misleading information.
