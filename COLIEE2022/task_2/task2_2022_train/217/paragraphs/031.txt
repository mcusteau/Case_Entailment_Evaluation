  I note that section 10(c) of Commissioner's Directive 081 reflects a commitment on the part of the CSC to try to resolve disputes on an informal basis. Given the circumstances noted above, the CSC is strongly encouraged to meet with Mr. Wilson as soon as possible in order to see if his concerns with respect to the information in his institutional files can be addressed through an informal dispute resolution process.
