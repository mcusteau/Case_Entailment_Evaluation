  I turn now to the submission of counsel for CPC that a very important element of bad faith by CPAA was that CPAA was aware that the unilateral withdrawing of its 1982 complaint in 1985 was not possible but that CPAA went along with proposing its withdrawal and entering into the 1985 agreement because it knew that the Commission's investigation would continue. However, s. 48 of the  
 Act 
  provides that any settlement, after the filing of a complaint, must be referred to the Commission for approval or rejection [see footnote 3]. Both parties must be taken to have known that this was the law. CPAA did attempt to withdraw the complaint but the Commission refused the request. Barring some collusion between the Commission and CPAA, of which there is absolutely no evidence before me, I do not see how the CPAA could have known the Commission would have continued with its investigation. This was a decision for the Commission alone. Indeed, the record suggests that although the Commission did not approve the 1985 settlement initially, it did dismiss the complaint in 1991. I cannot attribute bad faith to the CPAA on this account.
