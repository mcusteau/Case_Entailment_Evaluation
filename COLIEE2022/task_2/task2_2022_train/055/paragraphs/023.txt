  With respect, I think this case and others to which I drew counsel's attention at the hearing of this matter (for example  
 Dunmall v. Canadian Armed Forces 
  (1991), 15 C.H.R.R. D/425, in which eight years elapsed between the date of the complaint and the time it was brought on for hearing before a Tribunal) illustrate that the Commission seems to have lost sight of the importance of timeliness in resolving complaints brought to it. In this case, the Commission, after expressing its dissatisfaction with the 1985 agreement, decided not to dismiss the 1982 complaint. It kept the complaint alive but did not take any active steps to require the parties to bring it to a resolution. In 1991, even though the pay equity issue had not been resolved, it decided to dismiss the complaint. The 1992/1993 complaint has bogged down on a motion to dismiss at an early stage. It took the Commission almost two years to merely decide to deal with the complaint. There has not been any investigation. If after investigation the complaint is referred to a tribunal for resolution, it is not difficult to envisage a further two or three years being occupied in the investigation and tribunal processes. The question is begged as to why the Commission did not efficiently monitor the parties' progress under their 1985 agreement with effective case management or deal with the matter itself when it concluded that progress was unsatisfactory. Now the Commission has failed to move the 1992/1993 complaint forward in a timely manner.
