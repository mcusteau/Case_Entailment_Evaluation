  I summarize CPC's position here. The CPAA initially made a complaint to the Commission in 1982 respecting pay equity (the 1982 complaint). CPC says that in an August 25, 1985 agreement (the 1985 agreement) the CPAA and CPC agreed that the issue of pay equity should be resolved by agreement and, if necessary, by arbitration. The 1982 complaint was dismissed by the Commission in 1991. The pay equity aspects of the 1985 agreement were included in subsequent collective agreements between the CPC and CPAA and were in effect when the 1992/1993 complaint was filed [see footnote 1]. Therefore, CPC says the arbitration procedure which was available under the 1985 agreement ought to have been exhausted before CPAA made its 1992/1993 complaint to the Commission. As to bad faith, CPC says that the CPAA agreed in the 1985 agreement to withdraw its initial 1982 complaint to the Commission, received consideration for doing so and agreed to establish an alternative process for dealing with pay equity. CPC maintains that to resile from that agreement and file the same complaint again constitutes bad faith. CPC also alleges that the CPAA entered into the 1985 agreement all the while knowing that the Commission would not dismiss the 1982 complaint, which is said to be in bad faith.
