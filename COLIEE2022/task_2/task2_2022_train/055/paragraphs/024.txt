 [24] 
  The Commission must manage complaints that are filed in an efficient and competent manner. This includes moving them forward to conclusion on a timely basis. This has not occurred in the present case. The Commission should now deal with the 1992/1993 complaint at a pace which will bring its resolution at least before the end of the millennium. 
 
 
 
 Application dismissed.
