So, in fact, the defendants' servants took the plaintiffs' 70 tonnes of fish and the plaintiffs were judicially found to have committed no offence. The defendants thereafter declined to pursue any test of that judicial disposition and abandoned their appeal. Law and justice both require that the plaintiffs be compensated in full for that loss which was visited upon them by the defendants, without any fault on the plaintiffs' part. If, as the plaintiffs allege, the defendants have not compensated them in full, are they bound to accept the defendants' tally of the proceeds of sale of the plaintiffs' fish and thereupon be bound to limit their claim to the terms of s. 6(9) of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act? If the sum of $51,394.57 paid by the defendants be found to amount to full compensation for the seized fish it will certainly be "the proceeds [to] be paid to the person from whom ... [the fish] ... were taken".
