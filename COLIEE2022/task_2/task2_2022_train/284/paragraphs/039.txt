Mr. Randell's report of December 7, 1982, exhibit 9, indicates clearly the state of the plaintiffs' fish as it was removed prematurely from the hold of the "Bordoyarnes", since it was only a short time in salt, not fully struck and naturally soft, limp and containing moisture. Those attributes are not to be levied against the plaintiffs for they would not have disturbed their fish in early November 1982. Although there was much confusing testimony on the subject right-hand and left-hand splitting of each fish, in the end, nothing turns on it. The plaintiffs are entitled to recover the best prices for each grade and size which Her Majesty obtained at the material times on the market. Their fish, by operation of law, became Her Majesty's property and so the best prices obtained for such property should, in terms of the Crown's equitable obligation to the plaintiffs, be credited to the plaintiffs.
