Here Capt. Rasmussen was indeed charged with an offence under the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, but he was acquitted after a lengthy trial. When contrasted with the invasion of privacy perpetrated by the seizure of one's personal papers from one's person, home or office, to give a flagrant example, the seizure of saltfish from the hold of the corporate plaintiff's ship is no appreciable invasion of privacy, if it be such at all. When contrasted with Parliament's objective in enacting the relevant provisions of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, that is, the conservation and enhancement of the nation's fishery resources, one must agree with Craig, J.A., and his colleagues that the true conclusion is that the seizure of a portion of the saltfish carried in the vessel was, and is, not unreasonable. The authority to do it, and its actual doing, do not offend s. 8 of the Charter. It cannot be gainsaid, withal, that exacting a forfeitable bond in lieu of physical seizure of the fish, as Parliament also provided, would have been, and remains, an even more reasonable course of official conduct.
