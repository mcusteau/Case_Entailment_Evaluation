For these reasons, it is apparent that the plaintiffs are not held to have to make do with whatever sum the Crown chooses to pay as proceeds, pursuant to s. 6(9) of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act. In declining to market the plaintiffs' fish by the calling for tenders, in appropriating that fish to the property of the Crown itself, in selling the fish to the Crown's profit, in refusing to compensate the plaintiffs by payment of the full market value of the fish and by unjustly retaining the enrichment of that profit, the Crown is liable for the tort of wrongful conversion by sale of the plaintiffs' property.
