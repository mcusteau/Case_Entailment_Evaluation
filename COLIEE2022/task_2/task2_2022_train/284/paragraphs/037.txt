The plaintiffs' counsel urges that the evidence calls for an even greater, full-value, monetary compensation for the plaintiffs' fish. Capt. Rasmussen testified that at the material time, in 1982, the exchange rate was seven kronor to the Canadian dollar. This is the only evidence of it before the court. Neither side called or adduced any evidence from the foreign exchange department of any bank, or such like, by which the rate could be independently established. The defendants' counsel noted such lack of independent evidence, but he did nothing to fill that void. However, Capt. Rasmussen, despite his imperfect command of the English language, was definitely a most credible witness. His testimony as to the exchange rate was uncontradicted and it is the only evidence before the court. He further testified (page 48 of the first day's transcript) that "My home price was 14.5 kronor per kilo". That was the medium price in the range of size and qualities. (Page 57). The value of those 69 and three-quarters tonnes of fish taken from him, if the defendants had left it on board, would therefore have been worth to the plaintiffs a medium price of $2.07143 Cdn. per kilo, or, for 69.763 tonnes, the total sum of $144,509.17. That is the total monetary value which the Crown appropriated on an overall medium price for the 69.763 tonnes. Capt. Rasmussen testified about the specific grades of size and quality and the prices therefore which are fixed by a Committee of the "Home Government", which appears to set an initial floor price for fish brought home by Faroese fishing vessels. He recited the respective prices for choice, No. 1 quality of various sizes, No. 2 quality of various sizes and No. 3 quality of various sizes. He then applied the weights and grades (there were no No. 3 quality) assessed by the Canadian inspector and shown in what was exhibit A, which has become exhibit 10. On that rather more specific accounting, the total calculated by Capt. Rasmussen was 1,020,470.17 kronor. (This testimony is reported at pages 79 through 85 of the first day's transcript.) Applying the exchange rate of 7 kronor to $1 Cdn., the value of the seized fish comes to $145,781.45. This calculation comes to $1,272.28 more than the medium quality-and-size calculation earlier mentioned. Both totals are around between $37,200 and $38,500 less than the sum asserted in the plaintiffs' statement of claim.
