Section 25 of the Criminal Code provides essentially that everyone who is required or authorized by law (federal or provincial) to do anything in the administration or enforcement of the law is, if he acts on reasonable and probable grounds, justified in doing what he is required or authorized to do and in using as much force (but not more,) as is necessary for that purpose. Obviously the law would pose an impossible conundrum if one provision required a person to do something and at the same time, another provision forbade one from doing it. Section 25, and in particular s. 25(1), are emplaced in the Criminal Code in order to avoid the law's speaking with such a forked tongue. Hence, justification, if pursued according to the terms prescribed in the statute, obviates criminality on the part of the person who does what is required or authorized by law. It differs from an excuse, in that a justified act is by definition not criminal at all, whereas an excused act is an offence, but carried out in desperate circumstances in which the law declines to condemn or denounce the perpetrator. Justification does not necessarily determine the question of whether or not what was done nevertheless amounts to a civil wrong or tort. Clearly, the defendants' servants would not have been subject to criminal prosecution for their part in the circumstances of this case. Patently, and for the moment ignoring consideration of ss. 8 and 24 of the Charter, ss. 5 and 6 of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act seem, in the circumstances revealed here, to absolve the defendants' servants of criminal liability. This observation, however, does not conclude the issues in contention between the parties.
