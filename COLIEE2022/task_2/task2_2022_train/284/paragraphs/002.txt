This action was originally taken against three defendants, the third having been the Canadian Saltfish Corporation. That third defendant brought a motion to have the Canadian Saltfish Corporation (hereinafter: the Corporation) removed as a defendant. Mr. Justice Strayer dismissed the Corporation's motion as is reported at [1985] 2 F.C. 445. The Corporation appealed against the dismissal of its motion, however, and its appeal was allowed by a unanimous panel of the Appeal Division of this court as is reported at Canadian Saltfish Corporation v. Rasmussen, [1986] 2 F.C. 500; 68 N.R. 379. Accordingly, the action was dismissed as against the Corporation with costs, and the Corporation is not further involved here in the r√¥le of a party to this action.
