In cross-examination Mr. Wheeler indicated that the "proceeds" paid to the plaintiffs were made up of the prices for wetsalted, head-on, gutted fresh fish, purchased for salting, as disclosed on page 26 of the Corporation's Annual Report for 1982, exhibit 13. Such a basis of payment is revealed in Mr. Wheeler's testimony recorded on pages 35, 36 and 38, and again on pages 73 to 75 of the transcript of proceedings on the second day of the trial. This is not the proper basis for compensation to the plaintiffs for the full monetary value of their fish. Their fish was being salted with heads removed. The market value of their fish such as they would have received, had they never been troubled by the defendants' seizure of their fish, is the proper standard of compensation.
