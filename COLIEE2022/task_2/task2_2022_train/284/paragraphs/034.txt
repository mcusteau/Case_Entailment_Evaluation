According to the Canadian Saltfish Corporation's statement, exhibit 10, dated November 30, 1982, the Corporation discharged 153,800 pounds of "saltbulk" from the vessel. One kilogram is 2.2046 lbs. One metric tonne, being 1,000 kg., is 2,204.6 lbs. So, 70 tonnes is 154,322 lbs., or 522 lbs. (about one-quarter tonne) more than exhibit 10 discloses. Paragraph 5 of the statement of defence contains an admission "that 70 metric tonnes of saltfish were offloaded". Since exhibit 10 was presented by and through the plaintiffs' witness, Carl Wheeler, the plaintiffs' explanation, made in written submissions after the trial, is accepted: "the slight reduction would presumably, have occurred as the result of lost salt and moisture during the offloading process, which would be normal during the moving of partly cured saltfish". For purposes of calculation the metric equivalent can be taken at 69.763 tonnes.
