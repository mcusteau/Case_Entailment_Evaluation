It should be noted that the evidence clearly discloses that the saltfish seized from the "Bordoyarnes" were in peril of rotting or spoiling only because they were wrenched from the salt packing in the vessel's hold by the defendants' servants in the first place. There was, and would have been, no peril of spoilage if the 70 tonnes of saltfish had remained undisturbed on board. Any emergency was entirely of the defendants' own making.
