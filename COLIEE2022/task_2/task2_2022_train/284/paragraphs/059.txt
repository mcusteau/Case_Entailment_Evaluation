[59]
In accordance with rule 337(2)(b) the court directs the plaintiffs' solicitors to prepare a draft of an appropriate judgment to implement the court's conclusions, and to seek approval at least as to the form of it from the defendants' solicitors, before moving for judgment accordingly. Endorsement of the defendants' solicitors approval as to form will obviate most formalities in having judgment entered. The respective parties' solicitors and counsel may, in writing, and upon notification to each other, seek clarification of any perceived ambiguities herein.
Judgment accordingly.
