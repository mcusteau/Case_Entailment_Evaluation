The plaintiffs also claim interest:
"... on the sum of $51,394.57 from November 12th, 1982 to May 24th, 1984, and further interest on such amount as may be awarded by this Honourable Court from November 12th, 1982."
This is a claim for prejudgment interest. Sections 35 and 40 of the Federal Court Act, R.S.C. 1970 (2nd Supp.), c. 10, bear on the matter of judgment interest. Section 35 prohibits an award of interest on any claim against the Crown "in the absence of any contract stipulating for payment of such interest or of a statute providing in such case for the payment of interest by the Crown". No contract figures in these proceedings. However, by s. 3(1) of the Crown Liability Act, "The Crown is liable in
tort
for the damages for which,
if it were a private person of full age and capacity
, it would be liable ...". This is an applicable statute. By virtue of it, prejudgment interest may be awarded against the Crown in tort actions where such interest would be payable by a private person of full age and capacity, according to the law of the province which contemplates the trials of such actions. This is the reasoning expressed by the Appeal Division of this court in Marshall v. Canada (1985), 60 N.R. 180. The liability here is governed by the law of Newfoundland, where the tort was carried out.
