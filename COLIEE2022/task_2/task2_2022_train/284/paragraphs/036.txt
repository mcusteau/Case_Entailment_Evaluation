The Crown Assets Disposal Corporation which purported to dispose of the plaintiffs' fish to the Saltfish Corporation, reported on the first page of exhibit 12 the minimum prices for various grades of the plaintiffs' fish. Mr. Wheeler was asked to calculate the value of the quantity of fish shown in exhibit 10 - the 153,800 pounds offloaded from the "Bordoyarnes", at the minimum prices reported by the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation in exhibit 12, page 1. He calculated $111,365.84, the correctness of which calculation was not contested by the plaintiffs' counsel. The disposal corporation purported also to impose responsibility for offloading and transportation costs upon the Saltfish Corporation, so that by those standards, the sum of $111,365.84 would have been the gross proceeds of the sale at minimum prices.
