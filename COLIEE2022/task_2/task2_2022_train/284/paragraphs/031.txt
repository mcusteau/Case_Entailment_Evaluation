It is not every sum of the proceeds of sale which, in law or equity, will serve the purpose even of statutory compensation. The case of R. v. McRae (1981), 115 D.L.R.(3d) 420, decided by Mr. Justice Wallace of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, turned on the sale of 74 sockeye salmon seized and sold pursuant to s. 58(3) of the Fisheries Act. Here again are somewhat different circumstances but closely analagous legal considerations. Of the 76 fish seized from Mrs. McRae, 74 were sold to the Salvation Army for the sum of $1, and the remaining two were retained for evidence. After the Crown withdrew and stayed all charges, the judge of first instance ordered "that an equivalent of 76 ... salmon be returned to Rita McRae ...".
