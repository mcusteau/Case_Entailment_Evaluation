Paragraph 11(d) of the Charter, guaranteeing the presumption of innocence until proved guilty according to law was likewise not infringed nor denied. Capt. Rasmussen was not found to be guilty at all. He was acquitted. The seizure of the fish cannot be regarded as infringement or denial of the presumption and, in any event, the plaintiffs' counsel made it quite clear at the trial that the plaintiffs are not now alleging that the fisheries officers, the defendants' servants lacked reasonable and probable grounds for apprehending the vessel and laying the charge. He asserted, indeed, that they had such grounds, and denied any allegation of bad faith. Moreover, the plaintiffs' counsel admitted that they do not allege that the seizure or even refusal of a bond was unlawful, but rather only that the sale of the fish was unlawful. Those admissions by counsel are recorded at pages 113 to 117 of the first day's transcript of proceedings.
