On August 4, 1996, the applicant arrived in Canada using a false passport, because as he says, feared he would be apprehended by police if he were to use his real passport. The respondent asserts that he did it to avoid detection by Canadian immigration authorities. He made a claim to refugee status on November 1, 1996, using the mail-in program. On January 3, 1997, the applicant reported to the immigration department for an interview, at which time he was arrested.
