A similar approach was taken by Mr. Justice Rothstein in
Shubenacadie Indian Band v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.
, [1998] 2 F.C. 198; 138 F.T.R. 275 (T.D.), in which he wrote at paragraph 40:
"Given that a decision of an administrative tribunal in excess of its jurisdiction 'is not a decision at all', it seems paradoxical that the same 'decision' would be immunized from review where jurisdiction is never raised and the tribunal's jurisdiction and/or the constitutionality of its enabling legislation is assumed. This is tantamount to saying that parties to an administrative proceeding may, by waiver or acquiescence, confer jurisdiction on a tribunal that was not, or could not be, conferred by Parliament, and that this conferral of authority by the parties is unreviewable once the decision is made."
