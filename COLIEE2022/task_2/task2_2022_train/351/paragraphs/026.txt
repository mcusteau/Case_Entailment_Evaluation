In the case at bar, as was the case before Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer, at issue is the
jurisdiction
of the SIO to apply this section due to alleged constitutional invalidity. The Supreme Court of Canada in
Crevier v. Quebec (Attorney General) and Aubry; Crevier v. Quebec (Attorney General) and Cofsky and Alberta (Attorney General)
, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 220; 38 N.R. 541, held that a tribunal cannot be immunized from review for jurisdictional errors. Chief Justice Laskin quoted at p. 236 from Mr. Justice Martland in
Woodward Estates v. Minister of Finance
, [1973] S.C.R. 120:
"... if such a tribunal has acted beyond its jurisdiction in making a decision, it is not a decision at all within the meaning of the statute which defines its powers because Parliament could not have intended to clothe such tribunal with the power to expand its statutory jurisdiction by an erroneous decision as to the scope of its own powers."
