The matter of a certifiable question or questions arose at the end of the hearing. Both sides' counsel agreed that the first two questions certified by Mr. Justice Dub√© in
Raman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 125 F.T.R. 50 (T.D.), would be apt here, because they have not been presented to the Appeal Division of this court. They run as follows:
"1. Does a senior immigration officer have jurisdiction, either at common law or pursuant to s. 7 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and s. 52(1) of the
Constitution Act
, 1982, to consider re-opening a hearing which resulted in the issuance of a removal order in order for a person to claim protection as a Convention refugee?
"2. If a senior immigration officer does have jurisdiction to reopen is this jurisdiction limited to instances where there has been a breach of natural justice in respect of the original decision?" (p. 56, para. [27])
