In support of this argument, counsel cites
Sivaraj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 107 F.T.R. 64 (T.D.), affirmed in
Nagarajah v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
(A-42-96) (May 23, 1996 F.C.A.) for the proposition that the applicant must raise the constitutional arguments by way of action rather than by way of application for judicial review as the SIO did not have the authority to make constitutional determinations. In particular, the respondent quotes the following passage from the first instance decision in which Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer writes, beginning at paragraph 5:
"In their statements of claim, the applicants seek declaratory relief that the Minister's decision to remove the applicants to Sri Lanka violates the
Charter
. They argue that the only proper recourse for them is by way of action since under judicial review this court could not examine the
Charter
.
"I must disagree with that assertion. Unlike the facts in
TÃ©treault-Gadoury
, the Minister in this case was not asked to find a provision of the
Act
unconstitutional. If that were the situation, and if the enabling statute did not permit the federal board to determine the constitutionality of provisions of the
Act
, then it would be true that this court would not have the jurisdiction on judicial review to entertain such a request for relief but could only examine it under an action. Those are not the circumstances before me.
"However, this does not mean that the Minister may act contrary to the
Charter
. In
Davidson v. Slaight Communications Inc.
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038, the Supreme Court of Canada has expressly stated that a tribunal's powers are restricted by the
Charter
, at p. 1078:
'As the
Constitution
is the supreme law of Canada and any law that is inconsistent with its provisions is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect, it is impossible to interpret legislation conferring discretion as conferring a power to infringe the
Charter
[...] Accordingly, an adjudicator exercising delegated powers does not have the power to make an order that would result in an infringement of the
Charter
, and he exceeds his jurisdiction if he does so.'
"The Minister has a constant obligation to act within the
Charter
, and the court, under the rules of judicial review, must ensure that the federal boards act within constitutional standards. Unconstitutional conduct is presumed to be prohibited and therefore, a federal tribunal engages the
Charter
as part of its general responsibility. This court has often, under the rules of judicial review, examined the constitutionality under the
Charter
of decisions made by federal boards. In
Mobarakizadeh v. Canada
(1993), 72 F.T.R. 30, the Federal Court, by striking a claim which sought declaratory relief under the
Charter
, confirmed the court's jurisdiction to decide the constitutionality of a federal action by way of judicial review. I agree with the findings in
Mobarakizadeh
where Nadon, J., stated at p. 33:
'Section 18(3) makes it clear that the remedies provided for in subs. 1 and 2 can only be obtained by way of a judicial review application made under s. 18.1. Consequently, any application to obtain a declaratory relief or a writ of mandamus against any federal board, commission or other tribunal must be made pursuant to s. 18.1.'
"I therefore find that the applicants should not have proceeded by way of action to obtain declaratory relief under the
Charter
. The proper procedure is by way of applications for judicial review."
