If this court does not accept that the documents were delivered before February 1, 1993, the applicant argues that his application was so nearly completed that fairness dictates that his application be processed according to the provision in force at the time of the completion of the substantial parts of his application. He submits that the only step left to complete was the provisions of the applicant's conviction record and that such a step is minor in character as evidenced by the fact that it is not prescribed in either the
Act
or the
Regulations
. He submits that each situation should be examined on its own facts to determine if the steps taken by the applicant resulted in the vesting of the rights sought. He further submits that the final step was just by way of investigation and did not affect his right to have his application processed according to the pre-amendment provisions.
