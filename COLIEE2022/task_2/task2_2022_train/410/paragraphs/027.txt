The evidence shows that the application was accepted and that the receipt of the confirmation of the applicant's summary conviction was just the last step required to formalize his status as a landed immigrant. It was clearly admitted by Ms. Jeethan, on behalf of the respondent, that the only reason the applicant was denied status was that he was considered criminally inadmissible. As I explained above, this would not have been the case had the provision not been amended. Therefore, given that the document demonstrating his criminal admissibility to the country was delivered prior to the change in the legislation, I see no reason why the respondent can then contend that he was not able to be admitted to Canada. Thus, I am convinced that a final decision had been made to grant the application for residence and the application was not still pending at the time the legislation was changed.
