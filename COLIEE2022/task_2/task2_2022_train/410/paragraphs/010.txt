[10]
The remainder of subs. (2) is not relevant to this application, nor is subs. (3). Subsequent to the amendments of the
Act
under Bill C-86, and particularly s. 11(5), this provision now reads, in part.
"(2) No immigrant and, except as provided in subs. (3), no visitor shall be granted admission if the immigrant or visitor is a member of any of the following classes:
(a) persons who have been convicted in Canada of an indictable offence, or of an offence for which the offender may be prosecuted by indictment
or for which the offender is punishable on summary conviction, that may be punishable by way of indictment
under any Act of Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than ten years;" (emphasis added)
Again, the remainder of the subsection is not relevant to this application. Thus, by virtue of the fact that the applicant was convicted of a summary conviction offence which could have proceeded by way of indictment, he would not be eligible for admission to Canada under the amended provision. This is the basis for the Immigration Officer's refusal of his application.
