The RPD found that, despite a negative environment for homosexuals in St. Lucia, the Applicant had not reported any harassment by St. Lucian society at large. The Applicant has to establish a connection between his claim and the objective situation in St. Lucia. He has not made any allegations of persecution other than the 2002 attack by the assailant whom the RPD found was no longer interested in the Applicant. The Applicant has not shown he was or would be persecuted by the St. Lucian public at large.
