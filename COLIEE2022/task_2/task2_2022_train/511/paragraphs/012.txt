The RPD noted several substantial inconsistencies in the Applicant's evidence and found the Applicant not credible. The RPD noted discrepancies between the Applicant's evidence and testimony about the timing of his decision to apply for refugee status. It had the opportunity to observe the Applicant when he offered an explanation for the discrepancies. Applying the test in
Khosa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),
2009 SCC 12, the RPD's finding that the Applicant himself was not credible is within the range of reasonable outcomes given the evidence before it.
