[143]
At paragraph 119 of his reasons, Justice Blanchard found that the language of Guideline 7 left little doubt that the thrust of the Guideline indicates to Board members a mandatory process rather than a recommended but optional process: paragraph 19 provides that the standard practice
will be
for the RPO to begin, and if no RPO is participating at the hearing, the Board member
will
begin. Further, while paragraph 23 allowed for the Board member to vary the order of questioning, the basis for the finding by the Court in
Zaki
that it was sufficiently flexible, Justice Blanchard found that it set a high threshold for what constitutes "exceptional circumstances": the claimant must be "severely" disturbed and the child must be "very" young for an exception to apply. He concluded that while these may be just examples, they restrict the sort of circumstances that may warrant an exception. He went on to state these views on the language used in Guideline 7:
"The use of qualifiers such as 'severely' and 'very' leave little doubt that the scope of 'such circumstances' contemplated by the guideline is limited. There may well be circumstances which do not fit within the scope of those 'exceptional circumstances' contemplated in Guideline 7 which, in the discretion of the Board Member, would warrant proceeding otherwise than by the standard order of questioning. The language of paragraph 23 may leave a member with the impression that he or she has no option but to follow the guideline in such cases. At the very least, in my view, paragraph 23 by requiring 'exceptional circumstances' for straying from the norm deters the member from considering other factors before deciding what order of questioning is appropriate. Guideline 7 would in effect, in such a case, serve to fetter the member's discretion."
