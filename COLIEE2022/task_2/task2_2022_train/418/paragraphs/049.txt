[49]
As held in
Singh
, the
Charter
protects the personal security interests of
Convention
refugee status claimants. Those interests are engaged by the risk of being returned to persecution and claimants are thus entitled to fundamental justice in the determination of their status. "Fundamental justice", as used in
Charter
s. 7, is broader than the administrative law concept of natural justice. It encompasses substantive as well as procedural elements. At a minimum, fundamental justice in the refugee determination context requires that claimants are provided with an adequate opportunity to state their case and to know the case they have to meet. In
Singh
, the Supreme Court found that this requires notice and an oral hearing, although how that hearing was to be conducted was not specified.
