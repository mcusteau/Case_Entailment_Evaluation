As the applicants' argument goes, an examination of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
("the
Rules
") supports this interpretation. The
Rules
clearly and exhaustively set out the procedure to be followed by the RPD. While the
Rules
covered complicated procedural issues such as how claims may be allowed without a hearing (Rule 19), and how to proceed with claims involving issues of inadmissibility and exclusion (Rules 23-25), the
Rules
also spell out lesser aspects such as the procedure for scheduling hearings (Rule 21) and the appropriate size of paper to be used (Rule 27). The specificity of the
Rules
on matters of procedure as minute as paper size leads to the conclusion that something as fundamental as the order of questioning is not the proper subject of a guideline.
