Some of the applicants have submitted that an additional factor in determining the content of the duty of fairness in refugee hearings should be the short time allowed for the preparation of the claimants Personal Information Form (PIF). The argument is that as it is more difficult to present a complete history within the 28-day deadline, this has made it all the more necessary for claimants to present their cases first with the assistance of counsel. Further, they submit, the filing of the PIF and the presentation of the claimant's narrative in written form does not mitigate the need for an examination-in-chief. This is particularly so because of the central role that credibility determinations play in refugee proceedings. Since natural justice requires that credibility be assessed primarily on the basis of viva voce evidence, it follows that presentation of the PIF is not an adequate substitution for an examination-in-chief, the applicants submit.
