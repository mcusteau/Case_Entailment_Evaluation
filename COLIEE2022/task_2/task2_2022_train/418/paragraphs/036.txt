In these proceedings, the applicants' submissions start from Justice Blanchard's finding in
Thamotharem
that RPD members' discretion has been fettered by the manner in which Guideline 7 was defined and imposed. However, as he did not hold that the Guideline order of questioning, in itself, denied procedural fairness, the applicants collectively submit that the Court should recognize that a higher standard of procedural fairness is called for in refugee determination hearings. This, they contend, would include a right to an "examination-in-chief" by their counsel in advance of any questioning by the RPO or Board member. The applicants submit that this should be acknowledged by the Court to be an aspect of fundamental justice in the context of refugee hearings, as contemplated by s. 7 of the
Charter
, or, at the very least, as a principle of natural justice in the common law sense.
