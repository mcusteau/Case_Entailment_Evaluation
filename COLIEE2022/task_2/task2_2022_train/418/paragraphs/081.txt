The fact that the Member conducted what the Court described as a "badgering cross-examination" alone would have been enough, in my view, to send the matter back for a rehearing. However, it is also clear from the decision that the Court was concerned that the RPD had effectively set a trap for the applicant at the outset of the hearing by misdescribing the issues to be addressed. At paragraph 5 he states:
"It is quite clear that at the opening of the hearing the RPD had a suspicion that the Applicant's credibility was seriously in question, given the variance between the two statements which were in the written record. Immediately prior to asking for the Applicant's lawyer to consent to the procedure whereby the RPO would lead the claimant's case, the case was simply called 'a simple outlined claim'. As it turns out, it was anything but."
