[232]
In conclusion, I agree with the respondent that the applicants in this case who did not raise issues of procedural fairness respecting Guideline 7 before the Board and in their Applications for Leave and for Judicial Review should be precluded from doing so by way of written and oral argument at this time. If the objection was made in a timely manner at or before the hearing, the applicants are entitled to raise it as a ground for judicial review in their applications for leave.
