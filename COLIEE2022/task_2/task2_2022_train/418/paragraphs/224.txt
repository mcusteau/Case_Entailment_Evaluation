The applicants rely upon the decision of the Supreme Court in
Native Women's Association of Canada et al. v. Canada et al.
, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 627; 173 N.R. 241; 119 D.L.R.(4th) 224, in which the Court observed that a "basket clause" in the prayer for relief permitted a court to exercise its discretion to grant a declaration even though it was not specifically pleaded. The Court also referred to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Courts Act
, which among other things, sets out the various forms of relief which may be granted an applicant.
