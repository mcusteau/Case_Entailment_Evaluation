In the applicants' submissions, this vulnerability requires that the highest order of procedural protection be applied in refugee determinations and that the application of Guideline 7 be reviewed on fundamental justice standards. In my view, that vulnerability calls for sensitivity and discretion to be exercised by whomever is examining the claimant. Experienced RPOs and Board members may be more adept at it than inexperienced or poorly trained counsel.
