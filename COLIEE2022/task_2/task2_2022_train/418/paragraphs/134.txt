[134]
The factors relied upon by Justice Blanchard in arriving at this conclusion are set out in paragraph 135 of his reasons which I reproduce below in part:
"In the instant case, I am satisfied that there is significant evidence that the IRB made known to its members that they are expected to comply with the guideline save in exceptional cases. The problem is not so much with the expression of this expectation by the IRB, but rather its combination with a number of factors: the monitoring and expectation of compliance, the evidence of compliance, and especially the mandatory language of Guideline 7. These factors, in my view, all serve to fetter Board Members' discretion. As Mr. Aterman acknowledged in testimony given on cross-examination: 'It's a balancing which respects adjudicative independence on the one hand and the public and institutional interests in consistency on the other hand.' In the circumstances of this case, the balancing of these interests, essentially because of the mandatory language used in Guideline 7, results in the interests of consistency outweighing the adjudicative independence of the Board Member. The mandatory language of Guideline 7, the limited and narrow description of exceptional circumstances provided for in the guideline and the not so subtly expressed expectation of compliance by the IRB, all combine to limit a Board Member's discretion. The fact that there are cases where a Board Member has chosen not to follow the guideline does not cure these deficiencies. ..."
