[175]
In this context, I do not believe that there is any ambiguity in the interpretation of the paragraph that might be resolved by reference to a missing comma. The legislative intent from the plain language employed is that the Chairperson is authorized to both issue guidelines and to identify certain decisions of the Board as models for the members to emulate. This is, perhaps, clearer in the French version "... il donne des directives écrites aux commissaires
et
précise les décisions de la Commission qui serviront de guide jurisprudentiel". (Emphasis added) See further,
Policy on the Use of Jurisprudential Guides
, Policy No. 2003-01 (Ottawa: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, March 21, 2003).
