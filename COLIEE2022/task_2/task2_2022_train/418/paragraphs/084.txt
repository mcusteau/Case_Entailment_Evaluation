[84]
It appears that the hearing had commenced with the claimants counsel questioning first when the interruptions from the Board Member began. The issue of whether procedural fairness required that the claimant's counsel go first does not appear to have been squarely addressed in the proceedings as it had not been raised prior to the judicial review hearing. One may infer from the Court's reasons that it was the interruptions by the Board Member that offended my colleague's sense of fairness together with the RPO's extensive questioning.
