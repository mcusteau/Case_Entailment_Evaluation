I agree with the respondent’s reasoning. The fact that each of the documents filed into evidence was not mentioned does not indicate that the panel failed to consider it, given that the panel is assumed to have weighed and considered all of the evidence (Florea v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 598). In this case, the panel stated that it doubted the authenticity of several documents because the applicant’s story lacked credibility. In Singh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] F.C.J. No. 744, at paragraph 19, Mr. Justice Blanchard is of the opinion that this is entirely reasonable:
Since credibility is at the root of testimony before the Refugee Division, this Court has repeatedly taken the position of MacGuigan J.A. in Sheikh, that a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony.
