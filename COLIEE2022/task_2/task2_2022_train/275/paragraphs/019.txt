The applicant’s fear is based on the fact that he is a political opponent and that the documentary evidence on the human rights situation in Togo reports massive and systematic repression of political opponents by the government. The applicant alleges that the panel erred in dismissing the evidence on Togo without explanation. However, the panel reasonably determined that the applicant was not targeted in his country because of his political activities. The applicant’s fear cannot be based on the factors mentioned above unless he is able to connect the objective evidence to his personal situation. In Al-Shammari v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2002), 23 Imm. L.R. (3d) 66, at paragraph 24, Blanchard J. states:
This Court has repeatedly held that a claimant must establish a credible link between his claim and the objective situation prevailing in a country in order to be granted Convention refugee status (Canada (Secretary of State) v. Jules, (1994), 84 F.T.R. 161). Accordingly, it will not suffice for an applicant to present evidence showing problems encountered by some of this fellow-citizens. He must also establish a connection between his claim and the objective situation in his country.
