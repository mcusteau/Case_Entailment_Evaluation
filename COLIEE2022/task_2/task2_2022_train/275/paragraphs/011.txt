[11]
In rereading the transcript, I am of the opinion that the applicant had an interpreter available to him and that he understood the questions asked. Based on his conduct, the panel made unfavourable determinations on the applicant’s credibility when he answered questions saying anything to justify his story. These determinations are reasonable considering that they are supported by the applicant’s conduct at the hearing. The applicant has not succeeded in establishing that the panel’s decision was based on erroneous findings of fact drawn in a perverse and capricious manner and without regard to the evidence before it. The Court need not reassess the evidence, or substitute its opinion for that of the panel. It is the panel’s responsibility to hear the evidence and to assess the credibility of the claimant and the documents filed in support of his claim.
