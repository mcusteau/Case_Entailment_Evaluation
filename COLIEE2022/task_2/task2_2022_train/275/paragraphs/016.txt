It is my opinion that the panel took Togo’s particularities into consideration. The panel was correct to find that the acknowledgements on the card brought an element of negative credibility to the applicant’s story based on his conduct during the hearing. The decision was made after a complete analysis of the evidence and in my opinion the panel did not err in finding that the applicant lacked credibility.
