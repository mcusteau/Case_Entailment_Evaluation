There are many ways to make determinations in matters of credibility. In assessing the reliability of the applicant’s testimony the Board may consider, for example, vagueness, hesitation, inconsistencies, contradictions and demeanour (Ezi-Ashi v. Canada (Secretary of State) [1994] F.C.J. No. 401, at paragraph 4). In El Balazi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 38, [2006] F.C.J. No. 80, at paragraph 6, Mr. Justice Yvon Pinard states that even in some circumstances, the applicant’s conduct may be enough to deny a refugee claim:
The respondent correctly says that the IRB may take into account a claimant’s conduct when assessing his or her statements and actions, and that in certain circumstances a claimant’s conduct may be sufficient, in itself, to dismiss a refugee claim (Huerta v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (March 17, 1993), A-448-91, Ilie v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (November 22, 1994), IMM-462-94 and Riadinskaia v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (January 12, 2001), IMM-4881-99).
