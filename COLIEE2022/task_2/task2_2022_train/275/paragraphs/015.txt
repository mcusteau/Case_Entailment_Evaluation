The applicant argues that the panel erred in refusing to recognize that his mother died because of the abuses committed by the military during an illegal raid of the family home. The applicant alleges that the panel based its refusal on acknowledgements found on the back of his mother’s death announcement. The applicant states that if the panel had taken into account Togo’s particularities, it would have determined that it was normal to put the names of persons in positions of authority on the card. The panel determined:
The panel is of the opinion that it is completely inconsistent, in the alleged context, that people so high up in the Togolese government would appear with their wives and children at the claimant’s mother’s funeral and receive thanks from their hosts. This significant inconsistency, combined with the spontaneous testimony from the claimant that he has a large family, leads the panel to conclude that the claimant’s mother did not die under the alleged circumstances.
