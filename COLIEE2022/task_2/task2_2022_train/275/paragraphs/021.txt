The applicant contends that removing him to his country where his life is in danger would violate his rights to life and to security of the person as well as his right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, guaranteed by sections 7 and 12 of the Charter and by section 3 of the Convention.
[22]
I do not agree with the applicant. As the respondent stated, the argument relating to a breach of sections 7 and 12 of the Charter or of section 3 of the Convention is premature in the sense that the panel’s negative decision does not at all amount to a threat of deportation.
[23]
The Court has established that section 12 of the Charter cannot be raised before the final step of the deportation. The applicant’s argument is premature since the issue before the panel was only to determine whether or not he satisfied the definition of a refugee (Kabengele v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [2000] F.C.J. No. 1866; Plecko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1996] F.C.J. No. 567.

In Jekula v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1999] 1 F.C. 266, at paragraph 33, Mr. Justice John Evans refers to the scope of the rights guaranteed by section 7 of the Charter:
In summary, section 7 rights are not engaged at the eligibility determination and exclusion order stages of the process. However, the applicant cannot be lawfully removed from Canada without an assessment of the risks that she may face if returned to Sierra Leone. And the manner in which that assessment is conducted must comply with the principles of fundamental justice.
[25]
In this case, the panel determined that the applicant was not credible and that his fear of returning to Togo was not justified. Further, the panel made that observation based on the principles of fundamental justice.
