In a case which bears many similarities to the present case,
Merck Frosst Canada Inc. et al. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(1994), 169 N.R. 342 (F.C.A.), the Appeal Division of this court in a most helpfully analyzed and particularized decision dated May 2, 1994, dealt with the very sort of question in contention here. There
Merck
had made the same sort of assertions of infringement in regard to ss. 39.11 and 39.14 of the
Patent Act
. The president of Apotex, which moved to be added as a respondent, was cross-examined on his affidavit wherein he refused to answer certain questions as being irrelevant, and
Merck
moved to compel the answers.
