This is a close-run matter, for the respondent's point of view is not entirely without reason. Indeed it evinces pointedly trenchant observations about future conduct which could be none of the applicants' present business. The respondent's counsel at the hearing of this motion was persuasive, but for all of the foregoing elaborated reasons, including the canvassed jurisprudence, the court allows the applicants' motion and exacts answers on oath to the questions posed on cross-examination to Mr. Dan concerning: location of source and/or supplier of nizatidine; if an overly brief or monosyllabic answer, approaching contempt of court be attempted, then, is and will the source or supplier be located in Canada or outside Canada, that is to say, will Novopharm be importing its nizatidine or will it be manufactured in Canada? In regard to importation or domestic manufacture, the affiant shall answer about the planned dates or times of the commencement of each. In a nutshell, the affiant on behalf of Novopharm shall answer questions 152 through 159 recorded in the transcript of his crossexamination on May 25, 1994, and all proper questions arising from those answers.
