Among the questions posed on behalf of
Merck
were those in this category:
"- the name of the source(s) for the material listed in the [new drug] submission whether obtained in Canada or outside."
The court's decision was written by Mr. Justice Hugessen who stated that the information in "this category comes slightly closer to relevance". He wrote further at p. 361:
"It will also be recalled that in its originating notice of motion Merck has pleaded s. 39.14 of the
Patent Act
and alleged that any importation of norfloxacin by Novopharm prior to July 12, 1996, would be an infringement. A question seeking to know whether any of the sources named in the new drug submission were outside of Canada might therefore be relevant. That, however, is not the question that was asked. A question seeking the 'name of the source(s)' will not, by itself, reveal whether such source is in or out of Canada. Indeed, the name is wholly irrelevant to the question of the location of the source. The motions judge's refusal of this category should also be confirmed."
