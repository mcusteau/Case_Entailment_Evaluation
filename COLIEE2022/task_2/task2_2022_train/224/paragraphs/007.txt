  Compuoffice argues that, in instituting both an action for infringement, and an application for expungement, Compulife is seeking identical relief (i.e., curtailment of Compuoffice's use of the marks at issue), on identical legal grounds (primarily confusion with Compulife's earlier registered marks). Moreover it is submitted that, should both proceedings be permitted to continue, the evidence adduced in each would be identical. It is argued that since Compuoffice has pleaded its registration of the mark "COMPUOFFICE" as a defence to the infringement action, Compulife should simply amend its statement of claim to address the issue of the validity of that registration, rather than proceed with a duplicitous application for expungement.
