 [6] 
  The principal issue in this motion is whether Compulife's application for expungement, under s. 57 of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , should be stayed, pending its existing action for infringement, under s. 55 of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , concerning use of the same marks which are at issue in the expungement proceeding.
