Mr. Fagan's claims on behalf of the applicant were not recorded but instead the Mining Recorder ordered an inspection which was carried out within the next few weeks. On July 17, 1991, the inspector provided the Mining Recorder with a report. He confirmed that there was open ground between the J. Bill and Bull claims but stated that the Jon-Wedge claims overlapped the J. Bill and Bull claims. On July 21, 1991, J.M. Oberg, Acting Mining Recorder, wrote to Mr. Fagan advising him that recording of the Jon-Wedge 1-6 claims had been refused. The reasons given were as follows:
"An inspection indicated that open ground does exist between the claim groups Bull and J. Bill, however your #1 posts were all located within the boundary of claims in good standing. If you wish to stake this area, it should be staked as fractional claims. Please refer to ss. 17 and 26 of the
Yukon Quartz Mining Act
on particulars of staking fractional claims."
It is not disputed that before this decision was rendered the applicant had no opportunity to respond to the inspector's report or otherwise make representations as to the matters of concern to the Acting Mining Recorder. Furthermore there is no procedure for appeal from such decisions, although it is open to the person who has unsuccessfully applied to record a claim to return and stake the claim properly if someone else has not validly staked it in the meantime.
