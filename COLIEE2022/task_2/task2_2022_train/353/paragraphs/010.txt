It appears from the undisputed evidence that Mining Recorders have commonly accepted practices such as those followed by Mr. Fagan in staking and seeking to record the Jon-Wedge claims 1-6 as not invalidating the location. It is true that Mr. Fagan did not seemingly comply with the literal requirements of ss. 16, 17 and 42 of the
Act
in that what he was seeking to claim was irregular shaped open ground of less than 1,500 feet in dimensions yet he applied for a full claim using Form 1 for the purpose. On its face such a claim would be covered by s. 17 with the claim to be submitted on Form 2. The failure to submit it on Form 2 could be seen as a nonobservance of the requirements of s. 42(1). Further, when Mr. Fagan swore the contents of paragraph 6 of Form 1 to the effect that to the best of his knowledge the ground within the boundaries of the Jon-Wedge claims 1-6 is unoccupied and unrecorded this was not literally true because he knew, for example, that he was placing posts within the J. Bill claims. But it is also true that the Mining Recorder has commonly accepted claims in this form, doing so both before and after the rejection of Mr. Fagan's applications on behalf of the applicant herein, presumably exercising his discretion under s. 43(1) to do so.
