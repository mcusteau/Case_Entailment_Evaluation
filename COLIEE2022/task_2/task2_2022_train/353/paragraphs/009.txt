In my view the
Act
gives the Mining Recorder sufficient discretion in s. 43(1) to record claims which involve overlapping either through placing posts on another's claim or by asserting dimensions for the claim which would carry it over the boundaries of other claims. Section 43(1) specifically refers only to waiving failures to comply with the provisions of ss. 39 to 42 (39 and 42 being the relevant sections for our purposes) having to do with actual recording. However the subsection allows the Mining Recorder to validate the location, notwithstanding a failure to observe ss. 39 to 42, if it appears to the satisfaction of the Mining Recorder that the locator has staked as nearly as possible in the manner prescribed, that the locator has made an honest attempt to comply with
all
the provisions of the
Act
, and that the nonobservance of the recording formalities is not calculated to mislead other persons. It will be noted that this leaves considerable discretion in the Mining Recorder to decide whether there has been adequate compliance with the staking requirements, whether the locator has made a genuine effort to follow the
Act
, and that if there are defects, for example in the affidavit filed under s. 42, such defects are not intended to deceive.
