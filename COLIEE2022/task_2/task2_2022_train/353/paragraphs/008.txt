While this is the basic, logical, scheme of the
Act
it appears that for a variety of practical reasons many claims are staked that do not neatly comply with it. As indicated, the evidence suggests that anomalies frequently occur because of the difficulty of determining on the ground where boundaries really are and because of the concern for claiming all open ground available even if this means asserting a claim over land already the subject of a recorded claim. Further, the jurisprudence has sustained such practices. It has been held in respect of this and similar mining legislation that where a later claim overlaps an earlier one, the later one is not thereby rendered invalid but is subject to the earlier claim (See e.g.,
McAvoy v. Herriman
(1958), 27 W.W.R. (N.S.) 105 (N.W.T.T.C.);
Smith v. Yukon Gold Co.
(1911), 19 W.L.R. 8 (Y.T.C.);
Docksteader v. Clark
(1903), 11 B.C.R. 37 (B.C.C.A.), affd. [1905] 36 S.C.R. 622).
