Secondly I would grant certiorari because in these circumstances the respondents should be estopped from relying on the strict technical requirements of the
Act
when those requirements had been commonly and lawfully waived by the Mining Recorder in the past in the exercise of his discretion. The conditions for promissory estoppel are wellestablished (See e.g.,
W. and R. Plumbing & Heating Ltd. v. The Queen
, [1986] 2 F.C. 195; 1 F.T.R. 229 (F.C.T.D.) and the cases referred to therein). First there must be a promise which is clear and unequivocal. I believe that the Mining Recorder by accepting, in a routine fashion, over-staking and the filing of what are really fractional claims as full claims, has in effect promised to the prospecting community that if they stake and claim in this way their claims will not be rejected but will be the subject of a favourable exercise of the discretion under s. 43(1). There was reliance on that representation when Mr. Fagan on behalf of the applicant placed his posts within the J. Bill claims, described the claims as full claims which of necessity would overlap the Bull claims, and applied for the recording of the Jon-Wedge claims as "full claims" on the form appropriate for full claims. As a result he and his principals suffered a detriment when the Acting Mining Recorder suddenly applied the strict letter of the
Act
without the benefit of the discretion typically exercised under s. 43(1). (I can infer a detriment or potential detriment as s. 39 of the
Act
requires that claims must be recorded within a limited number of days after staking, and s. 16(3) makes the first staker's priority dependent on recording within the time specified. That time has long since passed here.) There was a potential legal relationship between Mr. Fagan and the Acting Mining Recorder because he was a prospective applicant for recording when he followed past practice and staked the claims as he did. I believe the Mining Recorder must be taken to have intended to make a representation to all prospectors, through the practice of his office, that staking on other claims and asserting full claims for what in reality would be fractional claims so as to be sure to embrace all open ground would not be invalidated and rejected for recording by the recorder's officer. This is not a matter of using promissory estoppel as a "sword" rather than as a "shield". It is a matter of disallowing the Mining Recorder from raising objections based on technical requirements of the
Act
when he has through past conduct represented that such requirements would not be invoked, such representations leading prospectors to stake and file claims as they have done in the past. Estoppel could not, of course, preclude the respondents from enforcing the strict terms of the law simply because they had not been enforced in the past (See e.g.,
Cohen v. Minister of National Revenue
(1991), 40 F.T.R. 225, at 233). But here the law leaves a discretion in the Mining Recorder to waive certain requirements which he has lawfully done on many occasions. This is not to say that the Mining Recorder was precluded from changing practice and not exercising in the same way the discretionary power provided under s. 43(1). But, given the widespread practice which, according to the evidence, had been going on at least six years, it was incumbent on the Mining Recorder to make reasonable efforts to bring to the attention of prospectors his intention to require strict and literal compliance with the
Act
and not to waive those requirements in future. If he had done this, then prospectors could be expected to govern themselves accordingly and not go out into the field locating claims in accordance with past practice.
