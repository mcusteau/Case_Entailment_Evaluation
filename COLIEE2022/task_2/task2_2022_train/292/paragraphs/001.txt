McKeown, J.
: The applicant, a citizen of Croatia and the former Yugoslavia, applies for judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) dated November 12, 1993, wherein the applicant was found not to be a Convention refugee. The central issue is whether the Board's finding that the applicant was a citizen of Yugoslavia can be supported in the circumstances of this case. The Board stated that:
"The claimant stated that she is a citizen of Croatia and a citizen of Yugoslavia. We accept the fact that she could not accept the protection of the country of Croatia, being an ethnic Serb; therefore, the issue was the fear of persecution from the Yugoslavian government or people therein."
