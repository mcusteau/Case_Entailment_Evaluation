[53]
Vote 58A states that the
Pension Act
shall apply "in respect of" service in a designated area. That expression is often a bone of contention when it is analyzed in the context of facts or circumstances in a particular case. The expression certainly lends itself to a wider interpretation than say "when service is in a designated area" or "in relation to service in a designated area" or any other similar expression which would indicate clearly that the coverage only applies within the strict confines of the designated area to which a peacekeeper is appointed.
