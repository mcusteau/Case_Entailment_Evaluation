It is obvious that each case, as to whether the member was "in service" at the moment the injuries occurred, will fall on its particular facts. But there are certain common elements in s. 21(1)(f) and the cases noted above: the knowledge of or control over the activity of the soldier by the authorities. But again, as stated by the Supreme Court in
Mérineau
relating, as I have said, to peacetime service, that control cannot be too remote. If the member is on leave without pay, for example, the authorities have no control over his activities. But if the member is granted leave with pay from his posting or duties, and the authorities have full knowledge of, or consent to his activities, he is, though not on duty, still in service. Further, if the activities of the member, while on his leisure time, are influenced by his superiors' orders, as was the case in
Chénier
, the member is in service.
