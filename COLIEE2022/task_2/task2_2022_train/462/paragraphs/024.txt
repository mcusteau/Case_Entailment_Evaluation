[24]
Both parties agree that the Veterans Appeal Board decision should be quashed on either of two grounds. First, the Commission breached a principle of natural justice when it accepted outside correspondence and did not allow the applicant to respond. This decision was not cured by the Veterans Appeal Board. Second, by virtue of the principle of "functus officio", the Commission had lost jurisdiction. The parties agreed that the Commission, once it had granted a pension to the applicant, could no longer reverse its decision. Section 88(1.1) of the
Pension Act
provides that the Entitlement Board should have been constituted if the Commission wanted to reverse the entitlement.
