The other element favouring the applicant is that at the moment of the accident, the applicant was on duty, therefore "in service". The applicant's Commandant confirmed that the 60 hour pass authorized leave from November 10 to November 13, 1990, while the three day UN Leave extended it from November 14 to November 16, 1990. Since the accident occurred on November 13, 1990, it happened specifically during the first 60 hour leave that he had been granted. A 60 hour pass is considered, according to Canadian Armed Forces policy, to be duty time. Therefore, the applicant was in service when the accident occurred and he would thereby be entitled to a pension.
