By letter dated April 14, 1992, the Commission informed Col. Forster that it had decided to reject the applicant's request for a pension. This rejection was based upon Col. Forster's reasoning that a member is not entitled to a pension when he is on leave outside the Special Duty Area to which he is assigned.
