Section 21(1) of the
Pension Act
, in turn, makes it evident that a pension is payable when any disability is incurred during military service during World War I and World War II, or as the French text says, "service militaire accompli pendant la Première Guerre Mondiale ou pendant la Deuxième Guerre Mondiale ...". A reading of the whole section leads me to conclude that the entitlement applies in all cases except those outlined in s. 21(1)(f) where again, however, by an exception to the exception, a pension is payable if disability or death under any circumstances is
attributable
to military service.
