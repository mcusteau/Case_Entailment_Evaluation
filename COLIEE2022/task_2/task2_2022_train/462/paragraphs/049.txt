There is evidence before me that the military authorities helped organize the applicant's trip, arranged for him to report to the U.N. Peacekeeping Base in Cyprus, and throughout, indicated interest in the incidence of a contemplated interracial or interfaith marriage. This, in my view, might be said to constitute "service", since the authorities granted the pass with full knowledge that the applicant was on his way to Israel and then Cyprus, with a military loan, and with the intention to marry once he had reported to the U.N. Leave Centre in Cyprus.
