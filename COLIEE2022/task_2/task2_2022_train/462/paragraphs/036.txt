[36]
The term as such has never been defined but a couple of cases may be used as guidelines. In
MÃ©rineau v. R.
, [1981] 1 F.C. 420 (T.D.), affd. [1982] 2 F.C. 376 (F.C.A.), revd. [1983] 2 S.C.R. 362, the plaintiff was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces who suffered a severe cardiac infarction. He underwent two coronary by-pass operations and while he was in convalescence at the National Defence Medical Centre, the plaintiff received an incorrect blood transfusion with the wrong blood type. The transfusional shock aggravated his situation and the plaintiff was declared 80% disabled. The plaintiff sued the Crown in tort. On the facts, at the trial level, Marceau, J. (as he then was), had to contend with two statutes, namely the
Pension Act
and the
Crown Liability Act
