 [7] 
  The applicants made an application for leave and judicial review to this Court on February 8, 2007, challenging the negative H&C decision. The Court allowed the application for judicial review in part, on the grounds that the H&C officer erred by applying the PRRA standard in the risk assessment portion of the H&C request. The Court found no error in the assessment of the best interests of the child or in the assessment of the degree of establishment of the applicants in Canada. The judicial review was granted on July 26, 2007 and the H&C application referred back for redetermination.
