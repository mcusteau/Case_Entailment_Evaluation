  In  
 Nazim v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 125, at paragraph 15, [2005] F.C.J. No. 159, Justice Rouleau writes: 
 
 
 
 [15] The humanitarian and compassionate process is designed to provide relief from unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The test is not whether the applicant would be, or is, a welcome addition to the Canadian community. In determining whether humanitarian and compassionate circumstances exist, immigration officers must examine whether there exists a special situation in the person's home country and whether undue hardship would likely result from removal. The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the officer about a particular situation that exists in their country and that their personal circumstances in relation to that situation make them worthy of positive discretion.
