  After noting the issues raised by the applicant in the appeal, the RAD stated that it focused on four issues: 
 
 
 
 • Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant's allegations of fear of gangs were credible? 
 
 
 
 • Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant did not want to complete military service? 
 
 
 
 • Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant was a supporter of the opposition and that he demonstrated a nexus to the Convention because of his imputed political opinion? 
 
 
 
 • Did the RPD err in its finding of fact that the applicant's delay in claiming undermined his subjective fear, which was fatal to his claim?
