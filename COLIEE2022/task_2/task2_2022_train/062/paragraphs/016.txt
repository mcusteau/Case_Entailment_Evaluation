  The RAD found that the RPD erred in finding that the applicant's allegation of fear of gangs was credible because the RPD omitted to consider evidence central to that claim. The RAD also found that the RPD erred in not exploring omissions in the applicant's testimony about his efforts to seek police protection which were contradicted by the affidavit of the applicant's sister. Given that the RPD did not refer to the totality of the evidence, the RPD's finding about the applicant's allegations of gang recruitment, his fear of gangs and the refusal of the police to protect him were not reasonable.
