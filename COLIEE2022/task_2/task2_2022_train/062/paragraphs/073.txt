  As noted above, the determinative finding for the section 96 claim was not credibility but the applicant's delay in seeking protection. The credibility findings found to be unreasonable by the RAD related to the applicant's fear of gangs and his allegations that the police refused to protect him. The RAD need not have revisited these issues given that the section 96 claim was denied based on the applicant's delay in seeking protection and this finding was not appealed. However, as the applicant notes, the RAD's negative credibility findings could have a negative impact on future decisions regarding his status in Canada.
