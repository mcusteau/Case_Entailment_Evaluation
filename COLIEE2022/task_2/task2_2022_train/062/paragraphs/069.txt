[69] 
  The Court elaborated on the considerations regarding the discretion of appellate courts to raise new issues, including: the jurisdiction of the court to consider the issue; whether there is a sufficient basis in the record on which to resolve the issue; and, whether there would be any procedural prejudice to either party (i.e. whether the parties will have the opportunity to respond) (at paras 50-52).
