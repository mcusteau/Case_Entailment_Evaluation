 [61] 
  Subsection 110(6) gives the RAD discretion to hold a hearing where three conditions are met: 
 
 
 
 (6) The Refugee Appeal Division may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection (3) 
 
 
 
 (a) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal; 
 
 
 
 (b) that is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and 
 
 
 
 (c) that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim.
