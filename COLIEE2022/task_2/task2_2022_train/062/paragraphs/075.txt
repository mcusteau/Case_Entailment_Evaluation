  In  
 Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 SCR 817 at paras 23-28, [1999] FCJ No 39, the Supreme Court of Canada set out a list factors affecting the duty of procedural fairness and emphasized that the content of the duty must be determined in the specific context of each case. The Court noted that the factors were not exhaustive and reiterated that procedural fairness is based on the principle that individuals affected by decisions should have the opportunity to present their case and to have decisions affecting their rights and interests made in a fair and impartial and open process "appropriate to the statutory, institutional, and social context of the decision."
