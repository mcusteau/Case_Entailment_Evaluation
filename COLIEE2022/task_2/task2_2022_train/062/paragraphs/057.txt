 [57] 
  In the present case, the RAD referred to the  
 Raza 
  factors of relevance and materiality, although it misquoted the materiality factor. The RAD stated more generally that the new evidence did not meet the requirements of  
 Raza 
 . The RAD also based its rejection on the wording of subsection 110(4) and Rule 33 which required the applicant to link his new evidence to his appeal.
