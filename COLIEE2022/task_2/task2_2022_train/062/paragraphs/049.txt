  With respect to questions of credibility, the jurisprudence has found that the RAD may or should defer to the RPD because the RPD has heard the witnesses directly, has had an opportunity to probe their testimony or has had some advantage not enjoyed by the RAD; see, for example,  
 Huruglica 
 , at para 55;  
 Iyamuremye 
 , at para 40;  
 Akuffo 
 , at para 27;  
 Nahal v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 1208 at para 25, [2014] FCJ No 1254. In  
 Khachatourian 
 , at para 31, Justice Noël noted that the RAD should assume its appellate role and that the same level of deference may not be applicable to credibility findings in an appeal as in a judicial review. Justice Noël also noted that an independent assessment or analysis of the evidence would be necessary to permit some level of deference. Justice Mosley noted that this was the prevailing view in  
 Balde v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2015 FC 624 at para 23, [2015] FCJ No 641: "The court has been consistent that the RAD ought to defer to findings of fact or credibility made by the RPD but must also conduct its own analysis of those findings."
