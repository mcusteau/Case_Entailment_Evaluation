No Generalized Expectation
: There is no generalized expectation that the bulk of the activity of a racemic quinolone would reside in one enantiomer. Dr. Castagnoli stated emphatically that there
will
be a difference in biological outcome as a result of chirality; however, on cross-examination, he stated that the difference could be so small that it could not be measured.
