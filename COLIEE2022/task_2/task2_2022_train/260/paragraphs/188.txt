[188]
Apotex alleges that the '080 patent is void pursuant to paragraph 40(1)(c) on the basis that: (1) the Applicant's agent failed to respond to an office action requesting particulars of interference proceedings involving the equivalent United States patent resulting in abandonment of the application; and (2) by so doing the Applicants breached their duty of candour with the Commissioner of Patents.
