As Dr. Wentland stated in cross-examination, the discussion about the 5-position in the Rolfing article is not in relation to the difference in potency between the enantiomers of flumequine. Rather, when the article speaks of the importance of the 5-position, it is referring to the fact that the various compounds under discussion share the common structural feature of having two additional carbon atoms attached at a certain place in the molecule.
