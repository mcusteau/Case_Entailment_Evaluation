[194]
The Applicant's patent agent, Mr. Herbert, innocently and inadvertently failed to answer the examiner's eighth requirement - to advise of the existence of any US interference proceeding - within the time to respond to the Office Action; however, the bona fides of his response is shown by the fact that he did notify the examiner of the interference by telephone prior to the examiner issuing the notice of allowance. Mr. Oyen agreed that there was nothing wrong with Mr. Herbert's practice of notifying the examiner by telephone rather than by letter. While Mr. Oyen initially opined that failure to disclose the interference changed the course of the Canadian application, he later admitted on cross-examination that this was based on his own speculation and not on any fact.
