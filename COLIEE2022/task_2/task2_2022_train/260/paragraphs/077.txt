[77]
Apotex' experts variously misconstrued claim 4: they improperly concluded that it does not cover levofloxacin hemihydrate. Dr. Neil Castagnoli did so as only claim 17 has the word hydrate in it; Dr. Erhardt considered that hydrates are not important since only a single claim (claim 17) mentions hydrates specifically; and Dr. Kellogg, did so as claims other than claim 17, as exemplified by claim 2, do not specifically mention the hydrate form and, thus, without considering the disclosure.
