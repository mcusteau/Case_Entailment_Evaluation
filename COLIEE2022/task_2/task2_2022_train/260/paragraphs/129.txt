There are no reports of any of the numerous racemic quinolones being resolved into their enantiomers up until the priority date of June of 1985, with the exception of the Gerster 1982 abstract and two additional Gerster references, which both taught enantiomers of quinolones were not worthwhile. The Gerster 1982 abstract reported the resolution of flumequine by its inventor some ten years after the compound had been discovered.
