A skilled person would not have been able to make predictions on the activity of the enantiomers of ofloxacin based on flumequine and other prior art. The skilled person would not have associated the chiral centre with any significant effect on activity. Instead, the '080 patent teaches that the chiral centre is critical to activity.
