Levofloxacin is in fact less toxic than ofloxacin
: Once levofloxacin was finally made and available for testing, toxicity testing showed that levofloxacin was more active and
less
toxic than ofloxacin. In the
Novopharm
Trial, Justice Hughes so found, based on substantially the same evidence of Dr. Rodricks now before the Court on this application. (Rodricks Affidavit at paras. 87-88, 93-94, 113-115, AR, v. 24, Tab 34, pp. 7140-7143, 7150-7151;
Novopharm
Trial, above at para. 126.)
