Viewed as a whole, the "new evidence" concerning inventive ingenuity is no more than conflicting evidence or a repetition of the evidence before Justice Hughes. As stated above, where the "better evidence" in the second case can be capable of different interpretations, it does not meet the standard set for when a second case can be considered in the face of opposite findings in the first case. The Apotex evidence, at its highest, is capable of different interpretations. In such a case "it would be far preferable to observe the witness at trial". (
