The prior art cited by Apotex (1976 Repta and 1978 Liu & Hurwitz) report that an enantiomer exhibited a fivefold difference in relative water solubility as compared to its racemate. The compounds were not quinolones and were unrelated to ofloxacin or levofloxacin. Liu & Hurwitz note that a fivefold is the upper boundary of difference observed.
