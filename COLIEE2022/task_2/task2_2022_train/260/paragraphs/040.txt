A second person challenging a patent that has previously been upheld in a prohibition proceeding, under section 6 of the
NOC Regulations
, must establish that it has provided either "better evidence or a more appropriate legal argument" than existed in the previous case. (
Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd. et al.
, [2008] 1 F.C.R. 174; 364 N.R. 325; 2007 FCA 163, at paras. 37-38, 50 (
Sanofi-Aventis v. Novopharm
).). As noted by Justice Hughes, in
Eli Lilly Canada Inc. v. Novopharm Ltd. et al.
, [2007] F.T.R. Uned. 828; 58 C.P.R.(4th) 214; 2007 FC 596 (
Eli Lilly v. Novopharm
), and
Pfizer Canada Inc. et al. v. Canada (Minister of Health) et al.
, [2008] F.C.J. No. 3; 322 F.T.R. 86; 2008 FC 11 (
Pfizer v. Novopharm
), it is difficult for the Court to determine if there is better evidence or a more appropriate legal argument, based solely on the reasons for judgment in a prior proceeding.
