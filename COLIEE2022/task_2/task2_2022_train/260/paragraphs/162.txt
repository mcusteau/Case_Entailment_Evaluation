When levofloxacin was obtained, the results of solubility testing were surprising. As of about September 20 1985, Daiichi had measured its solubility. Daiichi found that the solubility of levofloxacin was 22,500 g/ml, approximately ten times the solubility of ofloxacin. Daiichi's surprise was documented in contemporaneous research reports describing levofloxacin's increased solubility as "extraordinary".
