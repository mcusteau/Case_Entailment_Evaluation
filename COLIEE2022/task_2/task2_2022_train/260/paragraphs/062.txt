Claim 4 of the '080 patent has already been construed by Justice Hughes, by Justice Mosley in a proceeding under the Patented Medicines
NOC Regulations
; and by Justice Irene M. Keeley in a United States action involving the U.S. 407 patent counterpart to the '080 patent (in which claim 2 corresponds to '080 claim 4). The Court, in each case, construed claim 4 (or its equivalent) to mean levofloxacin (or S(-) ofloxacin) in a way consistent with Justice Hughes' construction. (
