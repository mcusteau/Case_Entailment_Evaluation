Dr. Kellogg agreed, on cross-examination, that the '840 patent only discloses processes to produce the racemate and that the details for the synthesis of a racemate will not produce a pure enantiomer. Dr. Kellogg also admitted that there are no instructions in the '840 patent that will lead a skilled person to the enantiomers.
