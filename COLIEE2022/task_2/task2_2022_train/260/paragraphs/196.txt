Mr. Oyen agreed on cross-examination that, where several requirements are included in an Office Action and one of those requirements is not answered, it could still be considered a bona fide attempt to advance the application. He agreed that if an inadvertent failure to respond to an Office Action necessitated a finding of no bona fide attempt to advance the application, the effect would be to the eviscerate all meaning from the "bona fide" element of the requirement. This is exactly the circumstance at issue in this application: an agent inadvertently did not respond to one of eight requirements in an Office Action within the time period prescribed, but did so later. Mr. Oyen also agreed that it is the examiner who makes a subjective decision on the bona fides of a response to an Office Action.
