It is noted, however, that levofloxacin may also exist in a form where the individual levofloxacin molecules are very closely associated with water molecules. Different names are assigned to these forms depending on the number of water molecules that are associated with each individual molecule of levofloxacin. A hemihydrate will have two molecules of levofloxacin for each molecule of water.
