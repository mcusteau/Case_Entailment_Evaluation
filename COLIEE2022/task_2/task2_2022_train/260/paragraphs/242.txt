A person of skill would understand from the activity and toxicity tests in the '080 patent that levofloxacin could have a lower toxicity and a higher therapeutic index (a measure of safety as assessed by examining the relationship between the toxic dose and the dose necessary for effectiveness) than ofloxacin in humans. This "expectation" of being a better pharmaceutical than ofloxacin is the promise made on page 2 of the patent.
