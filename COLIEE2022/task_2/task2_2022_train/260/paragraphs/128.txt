Dr. Wentland, the sole quinolone medicinal chemist in these proceedings, provided evidence that medicinal chemists did not follow a strategy of seeking enantiomers of racemic fluoroquinolones as of
1985
. Pharmaceutical companies during this time period focussed on identifying new appendages at various positions on the quinolone core. When asked, Apotex' experts deferred to Dr. Wentland on the views of a practising quinolone medicinal chemist in the relevant time period.
