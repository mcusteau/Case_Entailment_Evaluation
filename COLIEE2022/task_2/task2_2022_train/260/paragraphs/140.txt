The 1985 article co-authored by Dr. Stephen R. Rohlfing and Dr. Gerster (Rohlfing Article) compares various quinolones, including flumequine, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, against a specific bacterial strain, and discusses the 5-position and its relationship to potency (the 5-position is the location of the chiral carbon in flumequine, corresponding to the 3-position in ofloxacin). As ciprofloxacin is achiral, a skilled person would view this article as teaching away from quinolone enantiomeric resolution and instead to focus on substituents at that position as opposed to stereoconfiguration. Furthermore, the authors tested racemic compounds only; the authors did not obtain the enantiomers of flumequine and test them.
