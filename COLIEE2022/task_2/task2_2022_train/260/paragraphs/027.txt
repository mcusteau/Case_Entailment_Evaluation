In mid October, 1985, Dr. Kazuhisa Furuhama (a Daiichi toxicologist) conducted head to head acute toxicity tests and found that, for a group of five male mice intravenously injected at the 200mg/kg dose, for levofloxacin, there were no deaths, for ofloxacin, there were two, and for the (+)-enantiomer, there were three. At that time, Dr. Furuhama conducted further acute toxicity testing and determined the intravenous LD
50
value for levofloxacin in male mice to be 243.8 mg/kg. This was higher than the established LD
50
value for ofloxacin of 208 mg/kg, indicating levofloxacin to be less acutely toxic than ofloxacin. (Hayakawa Affidavit at paras. 59, 65-66, AR, v. 4, Tab 6, pp. 724-727; Kato Affidavit at paras. 15-17, AR, v. 10, Tab 14, pp. 2801-2802.)
