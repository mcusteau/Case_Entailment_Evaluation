Justice Hughes concluded in the
Novopharm
Trial that
the '840 patent did not contain any direction that the enantiomers of ofloxacin would be more active than the racemate nor does it instruct the reader as to how to effect such separation or to produce an enantiomer
. (
Novopharm
Trial, above as described in para. 104.)
