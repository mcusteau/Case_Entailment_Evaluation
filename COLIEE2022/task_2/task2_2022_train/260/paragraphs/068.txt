[68]
This Court finds that claim 4 includes within its scope both anhydrous levofloxacin and levofloxacin hemihydrate. This fact is supported by the '080 patent's disclosure, including the examples. Example 7 teaches levofloxacin hemihydrate, while Example 6 teaches anhydrous levofloxacin. The descriptions in the titles of Examples 6, 7 and 16 match the nomenclature and chemical name for the compound named in claim 4. Claim 17 includes the hemihydrate of all compounds of claim 2, including levofloxacin. Hence, claim 4, the compound claim for levofloxacin, would be understood in this context to include the hemihydrate.
