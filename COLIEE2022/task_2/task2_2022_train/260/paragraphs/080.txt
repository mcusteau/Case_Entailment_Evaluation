Gillette defence:
As an alternative defence, Apotex pleads what is known as the "Gillette Defence" arising out of the decision in
Gillette
. The classic statement of the defence is as follows:
"... The defence that 'the alleged infringement was not novel at the date of the plaintiff's Letters Patent' is a good defence in law, and it would sometimes obviate the great length and expense of Patent cases if the defendant could and would put forth his case in this form, and thus spare himself the trouble of demonstrating on which horn of the well-known dilemma the plaintiff had impaled himself, invalidity or non-infringement."
