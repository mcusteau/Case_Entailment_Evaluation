On appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal expressly found the '080 patent to be valid. It concurred with Justice Hughes' findings in the Federal Court that the patent was valid, that levofloxacin clearly demonstrated a special advantage and that Daiichi's work was more than mere verification. It was ultimately found that the patent was not obvious and that the Applicants had established utility. (
