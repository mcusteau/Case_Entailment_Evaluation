Quinolone Research was a highly competitive field
: In the 1981-1985 time frame, quinolone research was a highly competitive field. A large number of pharmaceutical companies and researchers were devoting a substantial degree of effort to the development of fluoroquinolones. This was particularly fuelled by the development of norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, which demonstrated improved antibacterial properties, and attracted the attention of many prominent pharmaceutical companies in the world.
