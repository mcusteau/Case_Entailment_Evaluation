The overall combination of the properties of levofloxacin
, of
increased activity
,
reduced toxicity
, and
increased solubility, in a single enantiomer could not be predicted
.
Apotex' expert Dr. Erhardt admitted this
. As restated by Justice Hughes in the
Novopharm
Trial:
"[126] ... The S(-) form of Ofloxacin has increased antimicrobial activity, reduced toxicity and markedly high water solubility, giving it an expectation to be a very useful pharmaceutical agent. This statement is correct.
To even find this distribution of attributes, namely, more of the beneficial properties and at least no more of the detrimental, was itself remarkable

Conclusion
Levofloxacin is inventive
