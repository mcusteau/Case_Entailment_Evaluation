[203]
Subsequent to all considerations, on every issue raised, in this NOC proceeding, no demonstration has been made as to invalidity nor infringement. Recognition is given to the previous Federal Court Trial and Federal Court of Appeal proceedings that had, in effect, exhausted all analysis of the asserted '080 patent claims. No better evidence, nor more appropriate legal argument, has been submitted in the present proceeding.
