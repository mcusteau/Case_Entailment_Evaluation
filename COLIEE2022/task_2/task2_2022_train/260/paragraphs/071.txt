"There is no infringement if an essential element is different or omitted in the allegedly infringing device, but there may still be infringement if non-essential elements are substituted or omitted. For an element to be considered non-essential and thus substitutable, it must be shown either that on a purposive construction of the words of the claim it was clearly not intended to be essential, or that at the date of publication of the patent, the skilled addressee would have appreciated that a particular element could be substituted or omitted without affecting the working of the invention."
