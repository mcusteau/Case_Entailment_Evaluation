[121]
Apotex relies on the following Ofloxacin References for obviousness: the '840 patent, the '892 patent and the Osada article. The invention claimed in the '080 Patent is not obvious in light of the Ofloxacin references. The Ofloxacin references disclose only the racemate ofloxacin. That an enantiomer's molecular structure is similar to its racemate does not obviate the enantiomer compound. (
