Levofloxacin's tenfold increase in solubility was surprising and unexpected
: Dr. Myerson's evidence is that the differences in the relative solubility of levofloxacin and ofloxacin would have been unexpected, in June 1985, to a skilled person. Dr. Myerson explained that, in order to determine the relative solubilities of levofloxacin and ofloxacin, a skilled person would first have to determine (1) the stable form of ofloxacin (racemic crystal, conglomerate or solid solution), and (2) whether it was a monotropic system (in which one polymorph is the stable form at all temperatures) or enantiotropic system (in which the stability of the polymorphic forms changes with temperature). Without this information, it would be impossible to determine whether ofloxacin or levofloxacin would be more water soluble at a given temperature.
