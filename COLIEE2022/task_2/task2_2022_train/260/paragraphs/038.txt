In a proceeding under the Patented Medicines
NOC Regulations
, the first person has the burden of establishing that the allegations of infringement and invalidity contained in the NOA are not justified; however, because of the presumption of validity set out in subsection 43(2) of the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4, the first person can meet the initial burden in respect of invalidity merely by proving the existence of the patent. (
