  In early 2007, Ms. Kaur Gill's friends put an advertisement in a newspaper seeking potential candidates for a husband for her. Mr. Gill responded to the advertisement. It appears that in June 2007, after one of Ms. Kaur Gill's friends had many telephone discussions with Mr. Gill, the couple began to have direct telephone conversations. Ms. Kaur Gill then went to India to meet with both families in July 2007. The couple met in person for the first time the following month, in Canada. They married in Canada a few weeks later. At that time, Mr. Gill was under a deportation order.
