  Ms. Kaur Gill submits that it was perverse and unreasonable for the IAD to conclude that her marriage to Mr. Gill was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, given that it also concluded that the marriage is genuine. She also asserts that the IAD unreasonably assessed the evidence she adduced regarding the primary purpose of the marriage. I disagree.
