  Ms. Kaur Gill submits that the IAD's conclusion regarding the primary purpose of the marriage was clearly perverse, given that she and Mr. Gill have been married for over 4.5 years and conceived a child almost three years into their marriage. Ms. Kaur Gill also notes that, in reaching its conclusion on this point, the IAD also unreasonably failed to consider and give weight to other evidence about matters that post-dated the marriage.
