Rothstein, J., noted that it would be reasonable practice for a PCDO to inform an applicant of documentary evidence of country conditions that is being considered, but failure to do so, unless that evidence is not public and is material to the decision, does not breach the rules of procedural fairness. That reasoning has been accepted by Mr. Justice Heald in
Xavier v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 120 F.T.R. 130 (T.D.) and by Mr. Justice Gibson in
Garcia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 122 F.T.R. 37 (T.D.). Fairness dictates that documents or other evidence not readily available to the public ought to be disclosed, but it does not require more. In particular, it does not require that, before a decision of a PCDO, there be disclosure of specific documents that are in the public domain and available to an applicant upon which the PCDO may rely for evidence of current country conditions.
