[27]
In written submissions in advance of the hearing, referred to briefly by counsel for the applicant when the matter was heard, it was urged that the PCDO erred in law in interpretation of the definition of the PDRCC class set out in s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
by referring to the absence of evidence of the authorities in El Salvador acting against former FMLN sympathizers. The applicant inferred from this that the PCDO implied that risk must be due to "authorities" of a country, a limitation not set out in the definition. However, as the respondent points out, the PCDO Decision Record also refers to the applicant's concerns about possible action by former FMLN sympathizers against him, and it specifically notes that the applicant's fears about activities and powers of former FMLN sympathizers is not supported by evidence.
