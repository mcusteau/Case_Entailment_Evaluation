For the applicant it is urged that the principle of disclosure and an opportunity to know and to address the case to be met is as significant in the context of determining a PDRCC claim as it is in criminal law as enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
R. v. Stinchcombe
, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 326; 130 N.R. 277; 120 A.R. 161; 8 W.A.C. 161; 68 C.C.C.(3d) 1. I am not persuaded that the principle of disclosure of evidence against an accused prior to trial is applicable in regard to documentary evidence of country conditions drawn from public documents readily available to an applicant in refugee or related claims such as a PDRCC claim.
