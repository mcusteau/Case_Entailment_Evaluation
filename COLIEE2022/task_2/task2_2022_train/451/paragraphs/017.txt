In regard to documentary evidence referred to in the PCDO Decision Record the applicant also identifies four publications said to be published after the date of his application on September 11, 1995. I discount one of those, the
National Geographic
for September/95, since one of the excerpts on country conditions included in the applicant's own submissions of September 11 is from that same publication. The other three documents are admittedly not from sources available to the applicant at the time of his submissions, and thus they were documents on which he could not have commented unless they were brought to his attention after his application and before the PCDO's decision. Yet they are not documents which are significant in themselves for purposes of the PCDO's decision. They introduce no new information that is not readily available from the other documents listed from published sources available to the public before the application was made. In my opinion, reference to those three documents does not constitute a breach of the duty of fairness that would in itself warrant intervention by the court.
