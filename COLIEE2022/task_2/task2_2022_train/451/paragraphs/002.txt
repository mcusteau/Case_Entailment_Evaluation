The applicant is a citizen of El Salvador who arrived in Canada on April 24, 1992 and claimed to be a Convention refugee. When his claim was considered by the Convention Refugee Determination Division, it was determined that he was not a Convention refugee. His claim was that he feared persecution in El Salvador, in part from former members of the FMLN, once a revolutionary force to which he had belonged but now a political party supporting efforts to establish democratic government in the country. He also claimed to fear persecution from the Army, to which he believed his name as a former FMLN member would have been communicated.
