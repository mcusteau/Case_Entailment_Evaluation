In my opinion, the materials here listed as consulted by the PCDO are publications available to the public, particularly to those knowledgeable about the processing of refugee claims, appeals, applications for leave and for judicial review, and of PDRCC applications. In all these proceedings reference is generally made to reports on country conditions, and those reports are generally from public sources and maintained and accessible through files, indexes and records available from or through the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. If the citations for some such documents appear obscure to the applicant that is unfortunate. I note that here submissions of the applicant himself, for inclusion in the PDRCC class, included an excerpt from Central America Report (CA Report, in the Decision of the PCDO), from Inter/Press Service (IPS Report, in that Decision), and two publications of the Question and Answer Series published by the I.R.B. for April 1994 and for March 1995 each of which has an extensive reference list of Central America Reports, of the Inter Press Service, of Agence France Press (AFP).
