The first concerns documentary evidence relied upon by the PCDO and its disclosure. The documentary evidence is of two kinds. The first kind is articles and published information on general country conditions in El Salvador, relied upon by the PCDO, which was not disclosed or identified to the applicant in advance of the decision, including a few documents published after the applicant had made his submissions. The second kind of information is materials provided to PCDO's by a draft manual and training materials including reference to methodology or guidelines for assessing risk, as is required by the definition of persons qualifying for the PDRCC class. The latter materials had not been seen by counsel for the applicant and were not a part of the record before the court when this matter was heard. Counsel for the respondent was directed to provide any such materials to counsel for the applicant, and an opportunity was provided for further written submissions on this aspect of the general issue of disclosure, and these were received following the hearing.
