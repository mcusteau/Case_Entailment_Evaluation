By letter of February 8, 1996 the applicant was informed that as a result of a post claim review, conducted in accord with
Immigration Regulations
, to assess what, if any, risk he would face if he were returned to El Salvador, it was determined that he was not a member of the PDRCC class. The reasons for that decision are set out in a three page document titled "PCDO Decision Record", a copy of which was sent to the applicant with the letter of February 8, 1996. It is that decision which this application seeks to have set aside.
