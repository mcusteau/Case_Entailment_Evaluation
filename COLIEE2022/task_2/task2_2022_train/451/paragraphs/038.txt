I am not persuaded that the second aspect raised by the applicant's proposed questions, that is, in regard to disclosure of documents on methodology and theoretical principles to be followed in risk assessment for considering applicants for the PDRCC class, raises "a serious question of general importance" within the meaning of those words in s. 83(1) of the
Act
. The questions proposed concern the application of an established principle to a new aspect of matters before the decision maker, that is, the necessity to disclose "extrinsic evidence", but application of that principle to methodology of decision making, rather than to evidence, does not, in my opinion, constitute "a serious question of general importance" within s. 83(1). Moreover, here no request was made by the applicant, in connection with his PDRCC application, for information on methods of risk assessment. No argument was here advanced about a different decision in this case if the manual or guidelines had been provided by the PCDO in advance with an opportunity to make submissions about them. In my opinion, the questions suggested in relation to disclosure of the method of risk assessment are hypothetical, that is, without a basis in the facts of this case that could lead to a different outcome were the Court of Appeal to answer affirmatively the questions posed by the applicant. Answering the questions as posed, in the circumstances of this case, would not dispose of this case. (See
