MacKay, J.
: This application for judicial review seeks an order setting aside the decision of the Post Claims Review Section of the respondent Minister's department in Vancouver, dated February 8, 1996, that the applicant is not a member of the Post Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada Class ("PDRCC"). In the result, since the applicant's claim to be a Convention refugee had earlier been denied, and there is no other apparent basis for his claim to remain in Canada, the applicant may be required to leave Canada at the respondent Minister's initiative.
