The Supreme Court of Canada in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 established the general principles relating to the presumption of state protection. At pages 724-725, LaForest J. stated:
[...] Moreover, it would seem to defeat the purpose of international protection if a claimant would be required to risk his or her life seeking ineffective protection of a state, merely to demonstrate that ineffectiveness [...]
[...] only in situations in which state protection "might reasonably have been forthcoming", will the claimant's failure to approach the state for protection defeat his claim. Put another way, the claimant will not meet the definition of "Convention refugee" where it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection of his home authorities; otherwise, the claimant need not literally approach the state.
He went on to assert that "clear and convincing confirmation" of a state's inability to protect would be required and that absent such proof it is to be presumed that a state can protect its own citizens.
