In the present case, there are many indications in the documentary evidence that state protection may not be effective. For example, there are documents in the National Documentation Package indicating that corruption remains a problem and that Mexican police continue to employ torture as an investigative technique with impunity (see Amnesty International Report 2005 "Mexico"; Amnesty International Report Mexico: Unfair Trials Unsafe Convictions). Moreover, the documentary evidence indicates that complaints mechanisms are weak, and further that when complaints are filed against police officers, the officers are provided with a copy of the complaint (see Country of Origin Research Document Mexico: Police -May 2004; Country of Origin Research document MEX38204.E: Procedure for charging a police officer with assault in Mexico). It is clear that this fact would make an individual reluctant to complain of ill-treatment at the hands of police officers and it has the potential of provoking reprisals. Again the Board was free to find other documentary evidence more reliable. However, it erred in failing to address the existence of relevant and contradictory evidence.
