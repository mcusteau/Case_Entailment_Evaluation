  The Fairness Committee comprised, in this case of a Director, agreed with the CRA Officer's recommendation with the following comments: 
 
 
 
 While the "memo from head office" is not in itself justification to uphold, the facts of the case do not suggest cancellation is warranted. The client relates no attempt other than being "advised by the Calgary TSO" to clarify the reporting. If there had been incorrect handling of the issue this could be considered sufficient however the client did not report the earnings as T4 income on the T1 return while expensing the cost to the corporation as 'salaries and wages'. It would be reasonable to expect this inconsistency to be investigated if there was due diligence in handling of this matter. This is not evident to me. No information included as to any other professional advice he may/may not have sought. The delays are not an issue since all actions were taken within timeframe outlined in the  
 Income Tax Act 
  & related legislation. While his T1 record is in fact good, this by itself is not sufficient to support cancellation.
