  The CRA Officer concluded that the Applicant's situation was "a result of ignorance of the law or third party errors", and "that the Applicant did not have a history of compliance with its tax obligations and had not exercised reasonable care in conducting its affairs."

The CRA Officer recommended that the request be denied.
