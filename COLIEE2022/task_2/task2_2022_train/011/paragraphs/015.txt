  The Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Lanno v. Canada (Customs & Revenue Agency) 
 , 2005 FCA 153 (paragraphs 3-7) conducted a pragmatic and functional analysis with the view of determining the applicable standard of review of a decision of a tax officer exercising discretion under subsection 152(4.2) of the ITA. The Court found the applicable standard to be reasonableness  
 simpliciter. 
  In  
 Comeau v. Canada (Customs and Revenue Agency) 
 , 2005 FCA 271 (paragraphs 15-17), the Federal Court of Appeal adopted the same reasoning and found that the standard of review applicable to a discretionary decision pursuant to subsection 220(3.1) of the ITA was also reasonableness  
 simpliciter 
 . I will adopt and apply this standard in reviewing the Minister's decision in this application.
