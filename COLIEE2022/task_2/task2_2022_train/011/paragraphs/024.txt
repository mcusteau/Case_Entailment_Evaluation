  I note that the CPP contributions were made in a timely manner by Brian Boulton and that the Minister at no time was out of pocket. There is no evidence of bad faith on behalf of the Applicant or Mr. Boulton, nonetheless, the contributions were not remitted by the Applicant on a timely basis as required under the Act.
