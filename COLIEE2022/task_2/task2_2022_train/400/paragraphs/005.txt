The applicant was interviewed by a visa officer at the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong on August 16, 1988. In her affidavit dated August 2, 1990, the applicant deposed at para. 9 that:
"The officer stated to me that I was violating the Hong Kong immigration rules because my employer had migrated [sic] to Canada and the contract indicates that I was employed by the employer in Hong Kong. The visa officer said that by Hong Kong immigration rules that once my employer had migrated to Canada, my contract had to be terminated and transferred to another employer. The officer said that although I was still working for my employer's parents, it is against the law because my employer's parents are not my employer ... The officer then said to me that she had not made her decision of whether to accept my application or not and needed to discuss it with other officials of the Canadian High Commission and would inform me later of their decision."
