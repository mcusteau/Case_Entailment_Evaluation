[19]
Accordingly, as I indicated on November 13, 1990, I granted the applicant's request for an order to set aside the visa officer's refusal and to direct the referral to another visa officer or visa office for a fresh review of this matter. The applicant shall have her costs of this application.
Application allowed.
