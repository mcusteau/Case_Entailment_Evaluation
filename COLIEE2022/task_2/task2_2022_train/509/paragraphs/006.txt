In the case at hand, the applicant argues that it was only upon the decision of Jerome, A.C.J., being rendered in April 1994 in
Deprenyl Research Ltd. et al.
v. Apotex Inc. et al.
(1994), 77 F.T.R. 62 (T.D.) that the new ground in question came to light. This being new law, the applicant argues that the delay is, on the face of it, excusable. That is the only reason advanced. As I read the evidence, the factual origin of this new allegation is the expert evidence of Robert G. Hirons as to the extent and scope of the patents in issue which was only produced on January 28, 1994 in file T-1946-93, and on February 11, 1994 in file T-2247-93, some four months in the first instance, and six months in the second, after the notices of allegation were filed.
