Other good reasons for rejecting speeches in Parliamentary debates are that they are not law, they sometimes misstate the law, and are frequently made for partisan advantage or public effect. In the instant example, whereas the Minister proudly mentioned (Hansard, p. 3075) that dichotomy between persons younger than 21 years and those Â 21 years of age and older, the Opposition spokesman, Hon. Donald Fleming in welcoming the proposed reforms (Hansard, p. 3078) chose to ignore that dichotomy in dealing in his remarks with people "who, having been convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude, have nevertheless established themselves in society or, as the Bill puts it, are rehabilitated". Whose version, in one chamber of the bi-cameral Parliament, can be said to unlock any secrets of interpretation?
