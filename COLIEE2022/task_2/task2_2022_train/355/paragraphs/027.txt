It would be tempting to say that because, when the applicant disclosed his conviction he was in the Canadian High Commission in London, and because the respondents' letter invoking s. 19(2)(a) issued from that place, and because the High Commission is if not de facto, it is in any event de jure Canada, that therefore the applicant circumvents the disability pronounced to apply in his circumstances. (Applicant's affidavit, paras. 12 to 14.) That would surely be a legal fiction in the tradition of the common law. The pronouncements, of the two appellate Courts are however too clear, and in the case of this Court's unanimous Appeal Division, too recent, to be diluted by a legal fiction no matter how worthy the cause. It may be noted that in the case of that half-bench of the Supreme Court of Canada in Singh (Beetz, J., for the other half, refrained from expressing any opinion on this subject) no requirement of citizenship is posited; and indeed it is quite the contrary, for a noncitizen in Canada may invoke all those Charter rights not reserved for citizens.
