The Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, were proclaimed in force as of December 12, 1988, but certain intervening legislation in the field of criminal law actually amended R.S.C. 1985 such that the applicable law here may be conveniently found in ss. 253 and 255 set out in Martin's Annual Criminal Code, 1990. These provisions of the Criminal Code are those offences "under another Act of Parliament" mentioned in s. 19(2)(a):
"253. Every one commits an offence who operates a motor vehicle
....
(b) having consumed alcohol in such a quantity that the concentration in the person's blood exceeds eighty milligrams of alcohol in one hundred millilitres of blood."
The Criminal Code, not being road traffic legislation, does not limit the above offence to being committed only on a highway. It can be committed anywhere including on or along a highway, street or road. So, here one notes the offence in Canada of driving a motor vehicle, on or off a road or other public or private place, after consuming so much alcohol as to concentrate in the blood a proportion exceeding 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood, (or its equivalent in the breath of 35 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath).
