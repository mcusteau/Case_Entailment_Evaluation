Under the approach to the matter of standing, crystallized in Minister of Justice v. Borowski (Borowski No. 1), [1981] 2 S.C.R. 575; 39 N.R. 331; 12 Sask.R. 420, before the emplacement of the Charter but later than that of the Canadian Bill of Rights, the law, according to MacGuigan, J.A., in the Council of Churches case, may be taken to accord litigants the choice between showing that they are personally affected and showing that they are entitled to public-interest standing. Here, it is quite clear that the applicant is indeed personally affected by the operation of s. 19(2)(a) of the Act, and so the other choice does not come into consideration.
