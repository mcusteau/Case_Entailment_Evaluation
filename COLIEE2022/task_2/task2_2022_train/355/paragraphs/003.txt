The relief sought in the applicant's notice of motion filed July 7, 1988, is an apt overture to these reasons. In it the applicant seeks:
"... relief in the nature of certiorari pursuant to s. 18(a) of the Federal Court Act, S.C. 1970-1971-1972, c. 1, quashing the refusal by the respondents dated the 21st day of March, 1988, of the application for permanent residence in Canada of Mayurchandra Khimji Ruparel for reason that the applicant is inadmissible to Canada in that he is a person described in s. 19(2)(a)(i) of the Immigration Act, 1976, for an order in the nature of mandamus pursuant to [said] s. 18(a) ... directing the respondents to reconsider and process the said application for permanent residence in Canada in accordance with the Immigration Act, 1976 (as amended), and the Immigration Regulations, 1978, (as amended), and for an order or remedy pursuant to s. 24(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms declaring that s. 19(2) of the Immigration Act, 1976 (as amended) is inconsistent with the provisions of s. 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to the extent that it constitutes discrimination based on age, which discrimination is not a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, and to the extent of the inconsistency, is of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, or for such other order as may seem just."
