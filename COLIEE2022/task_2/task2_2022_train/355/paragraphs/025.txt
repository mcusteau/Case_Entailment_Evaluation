As mentioned, on the facts of this case the Court would be quite prepared to accord this apparently worthy applicant the relief he seeks, including a declaration. The Court quite readily notes that it is the undoubted right of Canada to bar entry and residence to persons of criminal proclivities, but in the name of common sense and sanity, it is apparent (at least on this record) that the applicant is a good citizen who is devoid of criminal proclivities, or barbarous deeds. (One may note, by contrast, the case of Arduengo Narendo v. M.E.I., T-1985-89, July 24, 1990, F.C.T.D.). The applicant broke the law in the U.K. by driving under the influence of alcohol and, luckily, caused no injury or damage. It would appear that he was probably fully "rehabilitated", never again to transgress in that regard, at the very moment he perceived that a police constable was requiring him to stop his car. In any event it does appear that s. 19(2)(a) of the Act is unconstitutional.
