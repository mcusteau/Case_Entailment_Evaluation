The Council of Churches case is one in which the standing to institute Charter litigation is profoundly explored and the Appeal Division's judgment in part could have been, and in fact was determinative of the law in regard to the applicant's status in these present proceedings. That judgment shed old and new light. The council filed its statement of claim in January, 1989, seeking a declaration that most of the operative provisions of the new Immigration Act, as well as several provisions of the old Act were unconstitutional as breaching the Charter and the Canadian Bill of Rights. The government applied under rule 419(1) for an order striking out the statement of claim on the bases that the Council of Churches lacked standing to seek declarations of legislative invalidity and that the statement of claim, in any event, disclosed no reasonable cause of action.
