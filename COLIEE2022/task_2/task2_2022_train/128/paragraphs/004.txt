  Mr. Barboza submits the Officer erred in not considering evidence of continued employment submitted in August 2010, and that the Officer also erred in not considering submitted immigration forms that recorded his spouse had achieved her Bachelor's Degree after 15 years of education. Mr. Barboza submits in either circumstance, had the Officer considered the additional evidence or forms, the Officer would have awarded Mr. Barboza additional points. The additional points would have qualified Mr. Barboza for a permanent residence visa as a member of the skilled class.
