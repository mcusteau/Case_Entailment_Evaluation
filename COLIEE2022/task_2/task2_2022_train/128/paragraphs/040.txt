  In  
 Huang v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 135 at paragraph 18, J. Zinn of this Court discussed the issue of new evidence brought forward in an officer's affidavit: 
 
 
 
 As noted, the respondent put in evidence an affidavit sworn December 15, 2008 by the visa officer whose decision is under review. I concur with the observations of Justice Gauthier in  
 Jesurobo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , [2007] F.C.J. No. 1680 (F.C.), at paragraph 12, that  
 the respondent cannot rely on new evidence from the officer to change, explain or add to the refusal letter and the CAIPS notes 
 . It is an attempt by the officer to pull himself up by his bootstraps where his CAIPS notes may be deficient or too summary in nature. [Emphasis added]
