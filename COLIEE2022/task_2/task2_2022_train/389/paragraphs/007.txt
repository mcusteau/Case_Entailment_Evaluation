The Board then went on to consider the credibility of the allegations made by the applicant regarding her relationship with Mr. Gonzalez after 1998. The Board noted that there were no documents to establish that she had resumed living with Mr. Gonzalez after 1998. The applicant stated that she did not have documents because she had fled quickly and Mr. Gonzalez had the important documents. The Board did not accept this because she still had two sons living with Mr. Gonzalez and many family members who could have sworn affidavits. The Board also noted that there was no mention in the letters from her family of the time period during which the abuse occurred. Finally, the Board noted that the addresses listed on her port of entry (POE) notes overlap and this error undermines her claim that she lived with Mr. Gonzalez after 1998. The applicant claimed that it was because someone helped her with the forms and that it was wrong. The Board rejected this explanation as she would have had to provide the information to the person helping her with the forms. The applicant also claimed that she informed someone working for her counsel of the error before submitting her PIF, but the Board found it would have been reasonable to have included those errors in the PIF narrative. Thus, the Board was not persuaded that the applicant had a relationship with Mr. Gonzalez after 1998.
