The Board considered letters submitted by neighbours and relatives but the Board assigned little weight to the letters for, among other reasons, they were requested by the applicant and the letters were self-serving. A review of the evidence shows that the applicant did not ask for the letters but only provided her address to the writers. As well, it would seem to me that any letter written to support the applicant's claim would be, by the Board's reasoning, self-serving. This cannot be the case. An applicant has to be able to establish their case.
