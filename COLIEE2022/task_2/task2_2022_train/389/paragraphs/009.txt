Next, the Board found that the applicant did not provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence to support the claim that she had been physically harmed. The applicant asked to submit a document from a doctor after the hearing because it was late being delivered due to the holidays. The Board refused this request because the applicant had had ample time to arrange for the document. The applicant also claimed that her previous lawyer did not tell her she needed to bring a medical report, but the Board rejected this claim as the same lawyer had been the solicitor of record since the PIF was submitted and because the applicant and counsel were aware that documents should be provided as this was the basis for requesting that the first hearing be postponed.
