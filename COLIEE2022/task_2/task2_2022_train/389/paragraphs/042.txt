I would note that there were other credibility findings but in my view, the above mentioned errors are sufficient to cause me to find that the Board's decision with respect to credibility was in error. If the Board had considered all of the evidence on these matters, its decision on credibility may have been different. Based on these findings, I find that the Board made a reviewable error. Its decision was not reasonable and the decision must be set aside and the matter referred to a different panel of the Board for redetermination.
