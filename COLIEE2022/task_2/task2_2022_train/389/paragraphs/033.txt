The respondent finally submits that there is a high threshold that an applicant must meet when challenging a decision based on credibility and plausibility findings. The Federal Court has repeatedly held that even where there are certain credibility or plausibility findings that are not supported on the record, the decision as a whole may still be upheld where the overall findings were not unreasonable. Also, the Board was entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality and may reject evidence if it is not found to be consistent with the case as a whole. Finally, even if the Court finds there is an error, the cumulative effect of the deficiencies is not sufficient to undermine the Board's overall conclusion on credibility.
