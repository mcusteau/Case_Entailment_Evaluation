First, the Board addressed the reasons for denying certain procedural requests made by applicant's counsel prior to the hearing. Counsel had requested permission to submit a psychological report after the hearing as it had been difficult to schedule one due to the holidays prior to the hearing. The Board denied this request, as the applicant had filed her PIF on November 5, 2007 and had also successfully postponed the hearing twice. The first scheduled hearing which was to occur on May 6, 2008, had been postponed to allow the applicant more time to receive documents from Mexico. The Board found it unreasonable that the applicant could not have obtained a psychological report in the seven months when her hearing was postponed for the purpose of obtaining documents, or within the 14 months since her PIF had been filed.
