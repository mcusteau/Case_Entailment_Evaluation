I would state the issues as follows:
1. What is the standard of review?
2. Did the Board fail to articulate its reasons in "clear and unmistakable terms"?
3. Did the Board err in its determination that the applicant was not credible, based on the evidence before it?
4. Did the Board err in requiring corroborating documents?
