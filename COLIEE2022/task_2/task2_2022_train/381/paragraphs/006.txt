The Registrar also made the following findings:
a) The mark used on the invoices is not substantially different from the trademark as registered, even though the square design surrounding the design PANCALDI has been omitted. In this respect, the ap­pellant submits that in the said decision, the registered trademark is shown incor­rectly, that is, minus the rectangle design, which is stated to be the trademark as registered. (Registrar's decision, page 2)
b) Photocopies of labels are sufficient to establish use since there are statements of facts in Ziosi's affidavit indicating that the trademark is associated with the clothing items and accessories. On this basis, the registrar accepted Exhibit B as showing the manner by which the trademark was applied to the wares that were sold during the relevant period as illustrated by the invoices. (Registrar's decision, page 3)
c) That a so-called "pocket scarf" is a foulard, and therefore used in conjunction with the trademark as registered.
