Another issue raised by the applicant is whether the photocopies sufficiently demonstrate the use of the trademark as registered. The appellant relies on
Boutiques ProGolf Inc. v. Canada (Registraire des marques de commerce)
(1989) 35 F.T.R. 66; 27 C.I.P.R. 3 (T.D.), at 10 for the proposition that where only photocopies are available, there is an inevitable inference that only a photocopy was available, and that the labelling in question is no longer in use.
