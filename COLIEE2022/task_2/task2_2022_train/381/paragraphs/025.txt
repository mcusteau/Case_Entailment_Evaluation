Before I conclude, I should say a few words about the standard of review on appeal. The parties have referred me to different case law in their written submissions and I find that they are not inconsistent. In
Beverley Bedding & Upholstery Co. v. Regal Bedding and Upholstery Ltd.
(1982), 60 C.P.R.(2d) 70 (F.C.A.), at page 70, the Court of Appeal held that the standard was not whether "the Registrar has really gone so wrong as to make it necessary to interfere with his decision", but "whether the Registrar has gone wrong". In
88766 Canada Inc. v. Paulaner-Salvator-Thomasbr√§u A.G.
(1996), 115 F.T.R. 43; 68 C.P.R.(3d) 360 (T.D.), I had the opportunity to consider the standard of review on appeal, at page 367:
"In the case of
Classic Door & Millwork Ltd. v. Oakwood Lumber & Millwork Co.
(1996), 63 C.P.R.(3d) 337 (F.C.T.D.), at 339, a case involving an opposition to the registration of a trademark, the Associate Chief Justice states, in relation to the standard of review applicable where a registrar's decision is appealed:
'Before embarking upon an analysis of these alleged errors, I must consider the standard of review applicable to these proceedings.
'In
Kellogg Salada Canada Inc. v. Maximum Nutrition Ltd.
(1987), 14 C.P.R.(3d) 133 at p. 135, 11 C.I.P.R. 1, 9 F.T.R. 136 (T.D.), Strayer, J. (as he then was), commented on the applicable standard:
"in my view the court should be reluctant to reverse the finding of the registrar or chairman unless it is clearly satisfied that he came to the wrong conclusion on the facts or unless there is significant new evidence placed before the court that was not before the registrar."
'This position was further echoed by my colleague Denault, J., in
Mitac Inc. v. Mita Industrial Co.
(1992), 40 C.P.R.(3d) 387, at pp. 391-392, 51 F.T.R. 281; 31 A.C.W.S.(3d) 289 (T.D.), where he stated:
"... in cases such as these, the onus on the appellant is two-fold. First, the appellant must establish that the hearing officer erred in his appreciation of the facts or in his interpretation of the law. It is well-established that such a decision carries considerable weight and is not to be lightly set aside".'"
