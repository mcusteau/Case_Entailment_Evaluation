He made no such finding as to any other witness, nor did he need to state so in his Reasons unless he found them lacking in credibility. The Applicant bears the burden to show that the inferences drawn by the Member could not have reasonably been drawn and has failed to do so. As stated by Décary, J.A., for the Court in
Aguebor v. Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration
(1993), 160 N.R. 315 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 4:
"4 There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review. In
Giron
, the Court merely observed that in the area of plausibility, the unreasonableness of a decision may be more palpable, and so more easily identifiable, since the account appears on the face of the record. In our opinion, Giron in no way reduces the burden that rests on an appellant, of showing that the inferences drawn by the Refugee Division could not reasonably have been drawn. In this case, the appellant has not discharged this burden."
