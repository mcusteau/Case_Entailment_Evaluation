Counsel for the parties have asked that I reserve as to certification of a question for the Federal Court of Appeal. Accordingly, counsel for each party will have five (5) business days from the date of receipt of these Reasons to make submissions as to a question or questions, to me, and exchange these submissions with each other. Counsel will have a further five (5) business days to submit to me, with a copy to each other, comments as to the submissions of opposite counsel. I will then make a determination as to a question or questions, if any.
Application dismissed.
