Applicant's counsel argues that the Member applied the wrong legal test when considering s. 37(1)(a). These arguments are set out by the Member at pages 24 and 25 of his Reasons:
"She offered three legal arguments concerning the standard of proof to be applied.
"First, she argued that the provisions of s. 33 of the
Act
cannot be interpreted as to mean that a decision on inadmissibility can be made on the basis of reasonable grounds to believe, Rather, the wording of the section means that the facts adduced in evidence are subject to that legal standard, leaving the actual decision on that evidence and on those facts as to inadmissibility to be rendered under the usual and higher standard for civil matters, the balance of probabilities.
"Secondly, she argued that paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Act
may apply only in the case of current membership in a criminal organization. The statute omits reference to past or future such membership as a basis for inadmissibility.
"Thirdly, she argued, after describing the nature of the reasonable grounds test, that the test is variable, depending on the consequences. Where the matter under consideration is very important and a decision has grave consequences, a more onerous exacting of the test is appropriate - that is, '... a slightly higher standard of proof of reasonableness should be applied in cases where an interest in liberty is at stake'."
