[34]
I do not read the Member's Report at pages 53 and following under the heading "Criminality" as giving improper weight to charges laid or contemplated to be laid but which never went forward. These circumstances are mentioned in the Report but only in the context of a detailed consideration as to the circumstances themselves that were behind the charges or contemplated charges. It was these circumstances and not the charges or contemplated charges that supported the Member's findings that there were reasonable grounds for finding that s. 37(1)(a) of
IRPA
applied.
