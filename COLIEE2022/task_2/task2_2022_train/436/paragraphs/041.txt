The position of the jurisprudence of this Court is that the delay to ask for refugee status is to be considered amongst other considerations in respect of the situation as a whole. Mitigating circumstances can lead to a situation where women delay applications for refugee status due to having been traumatized and thus fearful of return should they be unsuccessful. That does not mean, by any means, that any, and every delay, is justified; however, reasons for such delay require examination which only subsequently can lead to a conclusion.
