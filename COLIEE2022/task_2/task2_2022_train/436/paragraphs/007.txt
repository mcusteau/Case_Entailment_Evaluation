Reference was made to objective evidence filed in support of the case of Ms. Myle and more particularly to the medical evidence establishing that Ms. Myle suffered from several injuries which, in all likelihood, were due to the abuse. Examples of abuse and murders committed in gender-related cases in St. Vincent do appear in the specific country condition documents included in the file of Ms. Myle relating to the lack of protection for women in St. Vincent.
