A change in attitude is necessary for the authorities to truly protect victims, as stated in the document
UN Government efforts to include women's issues in law stressed by rep of Saint Vincent & Grenadines
, dated January 23, 1997 (Tribunal Record, at page 74):
"In the presentation of the report on 16 January, the representative of the island nation stated that, despite the passage of a domestic violence act, an attitudinal change on the part of law enforcement officials was still necessary to stop the battering of women in her country. The prevailing attitude was that what went on in the home was 'the business of the family involved'. In the minds of many, the belief still lingered that it was the right of the man to beat his spouse. Reflecting the conflicting cultural norms of the region, women in Saint Vincent were expected to achieve their full potential and yet remain subordinate to men. One measure of enforcing subordination continued to be brute force."
