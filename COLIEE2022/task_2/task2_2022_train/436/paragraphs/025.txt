In the case of
Cepeda-Gutierrez et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1425; 157 F.T.R. 35 (T.D.), at paragraph 17, the Court said that the more important evidence must be mentioned specifically and analyzed in the tribunal's decision:
"However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact 'without regard to the evidence':
Bains v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
(1993), 63 F.T.R. 312 (F.C.T.D.). In other words, the agency's burden of explanation increases with the relevance of the evidence in question to the disputed facts. Thus, a blanket statement that the agency has considered all the evidence will not suffice when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons appears squarely to contradict the agency's finding of fact. Moreover, when the agency refers in some detail to evidence supporting its finding, but is silent on evidence pointing to the opposite conclusion, it may be easier to infer that the agency overlooked the contradictory evidence when making its finding of fact."
