As I read the provisions of s. 53.3, they do establish a judicial process whereby, if the taxpayer elects to take the steps open to him or her, the taxpayer may challenge the liability for payment of the tax in question. The Minister may not impose extrajudicial sanctions to collect taxes during the time the taxpayer's challenge is outstanding. There is, therefore, no basis for any argument that payment of taxes was due to compulsion or duress following May 1, 1986.
