Having regard to these rules of statutory construction respecting taxing statutes and to the statutory scheme respecting refunds under the
Excise Tax Act
, I am satisfied that s. 68 imposes a two-year limitation period which is applicable in the case at bar. If that were not the case, any taxpayer who filed a letter of protest, no matter how lacking in merit, could stop the limitation period from running. That is not a reasonable interpretation of s. 68. At a policy level, it may be arguable that the Government should not be able to avoid paying refunds for taxes paid in error by reliance on a limitation period or that the limitation period should be longer. But that is a matter for Parliament and not the court.
