I would first observe that even if some legal significance is to be attached to a letter of protest, such significance would not assist the plaintiff to demonstrate that payment was not made under a mistake of law in this case. The plaintiff's letter of protest states:
"This is a letter of protest, against the portion of Excise tax which we pay on transportation, in the delivery of our product.
"This is an unfair tax, in that, our competitors in the Ready-mix concrete business are exempt from paying this portion of tax which gives them an unfair advantage in production cost.
"
What is noteworthy is that the plaintiff did not argue that the tax charged on transportation costs was unlawful. The argument was that it "is an unfair tax" because it placed the plaintiff at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors who "are exempt from paying this portion of tax". The thrust of the plaintiff's argument was that all competitors should be treated the same, not that the tax was unlawful. As such, the letter of protest does not assist the plaintiff in the argument that the payment of excise tax was not made under a mistake of law.
