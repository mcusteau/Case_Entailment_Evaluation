  On May 9, 2012, the Advisory Body met and considered Mr. Sylvester's application. It concluded that the police report was strong and credible evidence of his involvement in the 1999 thefts and that it suggested that he might be prone to commit an act unlawfully interfering with civil aviation. It found that his written explanation and supporting documents amounted to mere bald denials and did not provide enough information to warrant recommending to the Minister that he receive a clearance. A Ministerial delegate wrote to Mr. Sylvester on June 7, 2012 to advise him that his application had been denied.
