  On March 13, 2012, the Chief of the SSP wrote to Mr. Sylvester to advise him that the SSP had received information which raised concerns about his ability to hold a transportation security clearance and that his application would therefore be referred to the Advisory Body. She laid out the allegations in the RCMP report and encouraged him to provide any additional information on the incidents, including surrounding or extenuating circumstances, and to contact the SSP branch if he had any questions about his clearance. Mr. Sylvester responded with a letter asserting that he had no involvement in the 1999 thefts and providing a court transcript indicating that the reason for the withdrawal of charges was credibility concerns with one witness.
