  It seems to me that more details should have been provided to allow us to conclude that the Board really did place the burden of proof on the Minister. After all, the applicant had already received a positive decision from the Board following an in-depth assessment of her situation. It is therefore only natural to ask the Minister to convince the Board, on the balance of probabilities, of the reasons why it claims that the original decision was erroneous. The Board may very well have been aware of these parameters; however, we cannot be sure simply from reading its decision. Regardless, it is unnecessary to continue analysing this issue, as I have decided to allow the application for judicial review on other grounds.
