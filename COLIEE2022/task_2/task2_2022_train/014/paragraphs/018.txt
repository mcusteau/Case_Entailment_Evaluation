 [18] 
  This application for judicial review essentially raises four issues: 
 
 
 
 ̇• Did the Board err in failing to clearly take into account that the burden of proof was on the Minister and in not applying the balance of probabilities standard? 
 
 
 
 • Did the Board violate the principles of natural justice by relying on its specialized knowledge without advising the parties beforehand, as required by section 18 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules? 
 
 
 
 • Did the Board err in law in finding that the applicant was a Djiboutian citizen? 
 
 
 
 • Was it patently unreasonable to find that the applicant lacked credibility?
