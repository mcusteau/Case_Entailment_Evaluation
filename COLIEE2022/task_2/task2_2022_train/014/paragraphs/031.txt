  Once the applicant's Djiboutian nationality has been ruled out, the only ground left to find that she is not Somali is her lack of credibility and the contradictions between her testimony and that of her sister and brother-in-law. However, the criticisms levelled against the applicant are not, in my view, as serious as they are made out to be and do not take into account local customs or that the applicant is a woman with very little education who left her country almost ten years ago, who experienced the horrors of war and the hardship of refugee camps, and who is from a very complicated family (her father had four wives and nineteen children).
