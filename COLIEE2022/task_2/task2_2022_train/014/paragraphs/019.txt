  It is settled law that the standard of review for questions of fact and credibility is patent unreasonableness. In other words, the Court cannot substitute its decision for that of the Board if the applicant fails to establish that the Board based its decision on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it [section 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. (1985), c. F-7; Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1800; Akinolu v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1997] F.C.J. No. 296; Aguebor v. M.E.I., (1993) 160 N.R. 315 (F.C.A.)]. For questions of law, however, the correctness standard should be applied (Pushpanathan v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 982; Chieu v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 1).
