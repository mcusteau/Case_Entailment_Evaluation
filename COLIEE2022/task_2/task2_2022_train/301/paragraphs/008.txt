It is not of course necessary for the Registrar to find that all of the circumstances specifically listed in subsection 6(5) exist, or exist to an equal degree, to be satisfied that the trademarks in question would be confusing. Looking only at the circumstances listed in paragraphs (a) to (e), I am satisfied that in relation to the evidence before the Chairman and before me it is proper to find the likelihood of confusion between the appellant's proposed trademarks and NUTRI-MAX.
