The Chairman of the Opposition Board on behalf of the Registrar, in decisions dated November 29, 1985, decided in favour of the respondent with respect to possible confusion with its trademark NUTRI-MAX and refused registration of the appellant's proposed trademarks. These are appeals from those decisions. They were argued together and it was agreed that, for the purposes of costs, they should be treated as one appeal.
