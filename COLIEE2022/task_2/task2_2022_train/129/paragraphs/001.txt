 Snider, J. 
 : The male Applicant, Artur Gavoci, his wife Brixhilda Gavoci and their son, Marcel Gavoci are citizens of Albania who arrived in Canada on September 21, 2003. They claim that they will be subjected to serious harm or killed as a result of a blood feud between the Marku family and the Gavoci family. In a decision dated June 16, 2004, a panel of Immigration and Refugee Board (Refugee Protection Division) ("the Board") rejected the Applicants' claim on the basis that state protection was available to them in Albania. The Applicants seek judicial review of that decision.
