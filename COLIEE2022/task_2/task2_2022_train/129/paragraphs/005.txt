  In dealing with the determinative issue of the availability of state protection, the Board acknowledged the existence of blood feuds as a serious problem in Albania. The Board also accepted that "the police and judicial system in Albania is somewhat weak and not as effective as it could be". However, after referring specifically to certain parts of the documentary evidence, the Board concluded, in a series of comments, that: 
 
 
 
 · . . . police and government authorities in Albania are making serious efforts to eliminate the blood feud phenomenon in Albania and to bring those who perpetrate acts of murder in the name of a blood feud to justice, albeit not always successfully; 
 
 
 
 · . . . Albania is in effective control of its territory and has military, police and civil authority in place; 
 
 
 
 · . . . police authorities in Albania are making serious efforts to investigate and bring to justice those persons that become involved in family disputes or blood feuds.
