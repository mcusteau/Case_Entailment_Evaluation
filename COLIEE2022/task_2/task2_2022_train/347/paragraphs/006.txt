The applicant's evidence is that he knew such action would result in his being charged with a disciplinary offence for issuing a threat and being placed in segregation, thereby avoiding the danger of being placed in General Population. The applicant was in fact charged with an offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations. However, the applicant maintains that at no time did he possess the intention of carrying out the threat; it was simply a threat uttered for the secondary purpose of remaining in protective custody.
