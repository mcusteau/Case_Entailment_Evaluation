[8]
During the course of the Disciplinary Court hearing on August 8, 1985, the applicant made a preliminary application to have the respondent stay the charge. Generally in criminal proceedings the decision to stay charges is made by the Crown Attorney. The effect of such a decision is that although the charges are not dealt with immediately it remains open to the crown to proceed with them at some future date. Staying a charge is not equivalent to "dropping" or "dismissing" a charge. My understanding, however, is that the respondent was being requested by applicant's counsel to entertain an application to withdraw or drop the charges. This view is supported by a letter sent to Mr. Guinet by counsel for the applicant dated July 24, 1985, wherein it was requested that he exercise his discretion and agree to drop the charge against the applicant. The respondent declined to entertain the preliminary application at the Disciplinary Court hearing on the grounds that he did not consider himself to be vested with the discretion to deal with such a matter.
