On August 8, 1985, a Disciplinary Court hearing took place wherein the applicant was found by the respondent Independent Chairperson to be guilty of committing a disciplinary offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) of the Penitentiary Service Regulations. The applicant now seeks to have that decision quashed on the grounds that the respondent acted in excess of or without jurisdiction by failing to exercise his discretion to entertain a preliminary application to stay the charge against the applicant or, alternatively, if the respondent has no jurisdiction to stay the charge, that this court has authority to do so in its supervisory capacity over the decision-making process of an inferior tribunal. In addition, the applicant argues that the respondent misdirected himself in law by finding that mens rea was not a necessary element of the charge against the applicant and by failing to consider and apply the defence of necessity and/or duress to the evidence before him.
