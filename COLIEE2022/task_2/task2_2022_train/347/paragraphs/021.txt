In interpreting s. 39 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations one must look at the whole section and not just the particular paragraph in question. In this regard, paragraph 39(b) deals with the offence of an inmate threatening to assault another person. I understand the words of that paragraph to create an offence where an inmate threatens to assault a person even though the threatened person did not hear the inmate threaten him nor was he in the presence of the inmate when the threat was made. Therefore, it would be sufficient for one inmate to say to another that he was going to kill the first officer he saw in order to have committed the offence set out in paragraph 39(b). When one continues to read regulation 39 and comes upon paragraph (g), the question which arises is what offence is created by those words in light of the preceding paragraphs.
