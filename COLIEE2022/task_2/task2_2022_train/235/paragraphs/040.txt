In my opinion, the visa officer did not fetter her discretion merely by obtaining the case notes of the Delhi visa officer. Nor was there any fettering of discretion by the Colombo officer simply considering the earlier Delhi assessment, and particularly the applicant's failure to pursue further studies, as a matter relevant in assessing personal suitability. I note the Colombo officer scored the applicant at 4 points, higher than the earlier assessment by the officer in Delhi. I note also that the applicant's lack of educational initiative was only one among several reasons, and the last one listed, that the visa officer in Colombo identified in discussing how she arrived at the personal suitability score was assigned.
