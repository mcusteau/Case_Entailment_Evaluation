In her affidavit, the visa officer states that when asked about his bookkeeping duties in his current job, the applicant responded that his bookkeeping involved writing down stock in and outflows and keeping track of customer cheques, but formal bookkeeping was done by a chartered accountant. In the visa officer's report of the interview, the applicant did not know the store sold food, though the job offer indicated that the store was a mini-supermarket/convenience store. The visa officer states that the applicant had told her that he and his brother-in-law had not really discussed the job. In her case notes, the officer wrote that "based on what the [applicant] has said I am not satisfied that the [applicant] really had the intention of working in the stated store as he seems to know very little about it. He does not otherwise have an occupation for which there is a demand in Canada."
