The appellant states in his affidavit that the officer told him he had not qualified because he did not meet "the criteria" and did not have the number of points the applicant's consultant said he did. She would not, however, reveal the applicant's point score. The officer, in her affidavit, states that she did not inform the applicant of his point score at the interview because she wanted to make sure she was awarding points correctly. On August 6, 1996, the visa officer wrote to the applicant to report that his residency application had been rejected. The letter indicated that he had been assigned a total of 62 points, 3 less than the 65 required for an assisted relative, including 7 points for specific vocational preparation ("SVP"), 0 points for occupational demand, and 4 points for personal suitability.
