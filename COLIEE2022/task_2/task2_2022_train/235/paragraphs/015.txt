In my opinion, the section as drafted applies only where the applicant for resident status has not been awarded any points for experience. On the facts, the applicant received 4 points for experience and as a consequence, I am of the view that the visa officer made no reviewable error in not relying on s. 11(1) in arriving at her decision. In any event, s. 11(1)(b) does not require the issuance of an immigrant visa; rather it precludes the issue of a visa unless the applicant is one who is without any points for experience and who is prepared to engage in a designated occupation, two conditions that are not applicable in this case.
