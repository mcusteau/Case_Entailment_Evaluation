 [15] 
  In order for a writ of mandamus to issue, there must be a legal duty to act and the applicant for such an order must be one who is owed that legal duty. Mandamus is not available where statutory authority is permissive or discretionary. In this case, action by the Superintendent or the Official Receiver depends upon the discretion of the decision-maker in all the circumstances.
