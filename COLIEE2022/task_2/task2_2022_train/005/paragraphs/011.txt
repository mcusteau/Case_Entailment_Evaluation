  I have already concluded this further application by Mr. Black is vexatious. I agree that the repeated attempts by the appli­cant to litigate essentially the same dispute, by naming slightly different parties, or ap­plying in different capacities and relying on slightly different statutory provisions, when earlier attempts have failed, also constitute an abuse of the process of this Court. Under rule 221(1)(f) of the  
 Federal Court Rules, 1998 
 , a pleading can be struck if it is an abuse of the process of the Court. While this rule only applies to actions, not to applica­tions for judicial review, in my opinion the Court does have inherent jurisdiction to strike an originating document in an applica­tion, at least in a case where the proceedings initiated by the originating motion constitute an abuse of process. That is the situation in this case, and Mr. Black's originating appli­cation shall be ordered struck.
