  The Superintendent submits that this is the fourth application in this Court for mandamus brought by Mr. Black (in various capacities), all concerning various issues connected with the bankruptcy of NsC Diesel Power Incorporated and seeking essentially the same relief. The first proceeding, in Court file T-2700-94, was brought by the bankrupt company and Mr. Black, in his capacity as a "shareholder/creditor" against Her Majesty the Queen. The application was struck without objection because it was held that an application for mandamus does not lie against Her Majesty. The second proceed­ing (T-724-95), referred to above, named as respondents "The Superintendent of Bank­ruptcy and the Official Receiver, as Agents of the Crown". That proceeding was struck on its merits [see footnote 7] following a motion for directions by the Superintendent. Thereafter Mr. Black sought to file a third application for mandamus, but it was not accepted because of failure to comply with the Court's  
 Rules
