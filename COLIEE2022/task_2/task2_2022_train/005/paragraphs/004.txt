  I note that while the order requested by Mr. Black, in the application commencing this proceeding for judicial review, would provide relief against the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the Official Receiver, neither were named as respondents in the notice of application. In addition, when the Superin­tendent intervened in the application, pursu­ant to paragraph 5(4)(a) of the  
 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
  (the " 
 Act 
 "), by Notice filed with the Notice of Motion for Direc­tions, Mr. Black objected in letters filed with the Court. I further note that the above-quoted portion of the notice of Mr. Black's application is remarkably similar to the application filed by the applicant in  
 NsC Diesel Power Inc. (Officer of) v. Canada (Superintendent of Bankruptcy) 
  [see foot­note 2]: 
 
 
 
 "AND TAKE NOTICE THAT the motion is for a Writ of Mandamus, or in the alter­native an Order in lieu of a Writ of Mandamus, against the Respondents, the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the Official Receiver for failure to follow the  
 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 [S.C. 1992, c. 1 and S.C. 1992, c. 27] ( 
 BIA 
 ); and an order, the particulars of which will be filed with the final submissions of the Applicants, direct­ing the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the Official Receiver, to fulfil their statu­tory duties of a regulatory nature in the supervision of the administration of the bankruptcy of NsC Diesel Power Inc., and in particular, to fulfil their duties pursuant to Sections 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 13.3, 13.4, 13.5, 14.01, 14.02, 14.03, 14.06, 14.08, 14.09, 16, 17, 19, 20, 25, 26, 28, 30, 38, 41, 45.(2), 69, 80, 81, 94, 95, 109, 112, 113, 119, 121, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 132, 135, 158, 159, 163, 181, 186, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209 and the  
 Rules 
  of the  
 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
 ." 
 
 
 
 In that application, the Superintendent of Bankruptcy and the Official Receiver were both named as respondents. Mr. Black, as an officer of the bankrupt company, was seek­ing an order, inter alia, to have the Superin­tendent press charges under the  
 Act 
 . On an application for directions brought by the Superintendent, I struck the application in its entirety on the basis that the circumstances before the Court did not support the award of an order in the nature of mandamus. I understand that a Notice of Appeal in rela­tion to that decision was initiated, but the appeal was recently dismissed by the Court of Appeal, for delay [see footnote 3].
