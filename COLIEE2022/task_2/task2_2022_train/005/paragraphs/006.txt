  The history of Mr. Black's various pro­ceedings in this Court is recorded, in part only, in decisions filed by me in 1995 and 1999. The earlier decision [see footnote 4] recorded reasons for dismissing the applica­tion brought in the name of "The Bankrupt, NsC Diesel Power Incorporated and the shareholder/a creditor, NsC Corporation Limited, by their Officer, applicants, and the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, and the Offi­cial Receiver, respondents". In that applica­tion the matter was heard only after Mr. Justice Richard, then a judge of this Court, had dismissed an application by Mr. Black to represent the applicants as an officer of the corporations and further ordered the proceed­ings be stayed until the applicants had a solicitor on the record, a qualification ful­filled by the naming by the applicants of Howard C. Funk, of Ottawa, as Interim Solicitor, whom the applicants advised had been engaged on a pro bono basis. That application, as earlier noted, sought man­da­mus against the Superintendent and the Official Receiver, and it was dismissed on its merits.
