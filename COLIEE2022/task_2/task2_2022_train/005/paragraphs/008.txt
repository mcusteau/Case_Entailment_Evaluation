  In this proceeding, for judicial review, without any authorization or application for leave to represent anybody other than him­self, but joining as applicants with himself, "The Creditors of the Estate of NsC Diesel Power Incorporated as represented by the Trustee of the Estate" Mr. Black has again initiated proceedings, and appeared to be heard before the Court, which I permitted, when the Superintendent's motion for direc­tions came on for hearing. While he may represent himself in proceedings before the Court, he may not represent any other person or corporation without leave of the Court, as I believe he must know. To initiate new proceedings for relief which has previously been denied, joining others as named appli­cants, without authority or leave of the Court is, in my opinion, vexatious.
