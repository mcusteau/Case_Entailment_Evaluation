 MacKay, J. 
 : The applicant in this judi­cial review proceeding, Mr. Frederick W.L. Black, is the principal respondent to this motion, brought by the Superintendent of Bankruptcy (the "Superintendent") as a Statutory Intervenor pursuant to the  
 Bank­ruptcy and Insolvency Act 
  [see footnote 1]. The intervenor, in this Notice of Motion for Directions, seeks orders including the follow­ing relief: 
 
 
 
 (a) to strike the proceeding on the grounds that it discloses no reasonable cause of action, is frivolous or vexatious; 
 
 
 
 (b) to strike the proceeding on the grounds of res judicata, issue estoppel and abuse of the process of the Court; 
 
 
 
 (c) to strike the proceeding on the grounds that the relief requested is too vague for any order of the Court to be issued or to found an application in mandamus; 
 
 
 
 (d) to strike the proceeding on the grounds that the pleadings disclose no evidence that the named Respondents have a statutory public duty, or power, to act; 
 
 
 
 (e) to strike the proceeding on the grounds that mandamus is not available where the  
 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
  contains alternate and adequate remedies available to the Applicant; 
 
 
 
 (f) to strike the proceeding pursuant to rule 59 on the grounds that the relief requested by the Applicant is not adequately de­scribed in the Originating Notice of Mo­tion, contrary to rule 301; 
 
 
 
 (g) restricting the Applicant, either as himself or in some other purported capac­ity, from commencing any further proceed­ings in this Honourable Court dealing with the Estate of NsC Diesel Power Incorpor­ated without prior leave of the Court.
