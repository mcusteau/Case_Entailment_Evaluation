Moreover, many factors must be considered when evaluating the genuineness of the adoption, only one of which is the nature of the relationship with the child's natural parents. It is a very subjective analysis. In L. Waldman,
Immigration Law and Practice
, looseleaf (Markham, Ont.: Butterworths, 1992), the author states at 10.145.24:
"The second issue that will arise in cases involving adoption is whether or not a genuine parent-child relationship has been created, and whether or not the adoption was entered into for the purpose of facilitating the admission to Canada of the applicant. This is clearly a very subjective question. When considering the genuineness of an adoption, the Appeal Division will look at all of the evidence before it to determine whether or not a genuine parent child relationship has been created. Evidence of the ties between the adoptive parents and the child, communication between the adoptive parents and the child, financial support between the adoptive patents and child, and
control exercised by the adoptive parents over the life of the child
will be considered by the Board. An explanation of why the adoption was entered into is also a relevant consideration.
None of these factors is determinative, and the Board will consider all of the factors in order to determine whether of not a parent-child relationship has been created.
