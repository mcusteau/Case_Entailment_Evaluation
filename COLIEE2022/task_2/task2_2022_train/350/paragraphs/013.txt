The Minister submits that the manner in which the visa officer came to her decision is irrelevant because the issue before the Board is whether the final decision was correct. In
Rattan v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 73 F.T.R. 195 (T.D.), Madam Justice Reed stated at page 198:
"[6] The Appeal Division treated the appeal under s. 77 as more than just a review of the immigration officer's decision on the basis of the evidence before him. The Appeal Division heard additional evidence, from the applicant, which was not before the immigration officer who made the initial refusal. It addressed its reasons to the evidence before it and decided the issues on that basis.
"[7]
An appeal under s. 77 is not a judicial review where only the correctness of the immigration officer's decision on the basis of the material before him or her is under consideration.
This is clear from s. 77(3) which allows for appeals on questions of fact and from the procedure followed which allows the sponsor, in Canada, to call witnesses and other evidence.
The Appeal Division's role is not to determine whether the immigration officer's decision was correctly taken, but to determine if the sponsoree is in fact a member of the class of persons excluded by s. 4(3) of the Regulations:
Mohammed v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1986] 3 F.C. 90 (C.A.), at 94, per Thurlow, C.J.
For that purpose the sponsor's evidence, and the immigration officer's decision must be reviewed in coming to the decision. If the sponsor can satisfy the panel that the immigration officer's conclusions were incorrect, an appeal is allowed.
