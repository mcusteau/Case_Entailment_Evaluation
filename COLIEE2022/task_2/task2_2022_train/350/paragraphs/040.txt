The
Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement
provides some background regarding these changes. It states that the
Regulations
seek to reduce the potential of adoptions of convenience, which are defined as adoptions undertaken for immigration purposes, as well as adoptions undertaken for the eventual sponsorship of the birth family. The
RIAS
clarifies that adoptions undertaken for immigration purposes are adoptions undertaken to circumvent immigration requirements. Where, as here, statutory interpretation is in contention, the
RIAS
can help the court to interpret legislation.
