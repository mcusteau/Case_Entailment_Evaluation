The Board stated the following at page 4 of the decision:
"5. The 'best interests' of the child is the primary consideration
"Counsel submits that the
Baker
case, read together with the
Convention on the Rights of the Child
prescribes that the 'best interests' of the child must be a paramount consideration in all actions, including when interpreting 'adopted'.
He proposes no support for this argument, other than the existence of the two authorities he references.
Counsel has provided no analysis or possible application of his assertion.
I am not persuaded by this position. He has not established that the principles established in
Baker
apply to the sponsorship of a foreign resident child. Even if I were to consider the application of this principle, there is no evidence in this case, beyond counsel's speculation, which proves what is in the 'best interests' of the Applicant." (Emphasis added)
