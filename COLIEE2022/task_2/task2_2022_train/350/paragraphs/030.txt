The applicant submits that the current definition of "adopted" has two purposes: to allow the adoption of children who are under the age of 19, and to prevent the circumvention of immigration requirements. The applicant submits that the law tries to prevent two types of immigration abuse. The first is when a child enters Canada to sponsor his or her birth family. The second is when a child is adopted to avoid the more demanding evaluation for independent workers and obtains employment upon arrival in Canada. The applicant submits that it is the latter type of abuse which is targeted by the legislation. The applicant defines the goals of the legislation as preventing the illegal immigration of children who then start working, or who fall into the social system for support, or who are forced by their adoptive parents into the job market, or into the social welfare system.
