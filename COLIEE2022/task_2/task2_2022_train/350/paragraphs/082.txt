In L. Waldman,
Immigration Law and Practice
, supra, the author states the following at 10.145.25:
"There is as yet no jurisprudence in the Federal Court which assists in establishing the parameters for a genuine relationship of parent and child. It is submitted, however, that the visa officer and the Board, on appeal, ought to consider whether or not the adoptive parents have established clear emotional links with the adopted child and have demonstrated genuine love and concern. However, the evaluation of the evidence must be done within the context of the reality that the adoptive child has not been able to be reunited with his adoptive parents because of the requirements of the
Immigration Act
that the child apply for and obtain an immigrant visa before coming to Canada. The distances that separate the adoptive parents from their child are so often such that it makes it extremely difficult to create a close bond prior to the child's arrival in Canada. In some circumstances, notwithstanding the fact that an adoption has taken place, the adoptive parents will determine that it is in the best interest of the child to leave the child with the natural parents.
Immigration Regulations
preclude the adoptive parents from bringing the child to Canada. The adoptive parents, when considering the best interests of the child, may opt to leave the child with the natural parents in circumstances where there is no other more viable alternative.
This fact in and of itself ought not to be determinative of the question of whether of not a genuine parent-child relationship has been created.
