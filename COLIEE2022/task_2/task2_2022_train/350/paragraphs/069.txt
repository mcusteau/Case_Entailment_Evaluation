The applicant submits that under Canadian law the relationship before and after the adoption between the child and her natural parents is irrelevant. The applicant also submits that transferring authority from the natural parents to the adoptive parents is irrelevant. The applicant submits that it is possible for both sets of parents to have a genuine parent/child relationship with the adopted child. The existence of a parent/child relationship with the natural parents should not preclude the existence of a parent/child relationship with the adoptive parents. Parliament did not intend to encourage severing the child's relationship with her natural parents before arriving in Canada.
