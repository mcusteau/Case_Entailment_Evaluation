The applicant submitted in oral argument that if the visa officer's alleged errors of law are irrelevant to the Board, the applicant's remedy from the decision of the visa officer must be a judicial review in the Federal Court. The proposition is incorrect because it is the Board which is enabled under s. 77(3) to review decisions of the visa officer on any ground of appeal involving a question of law or fact, or mixed law and fact; the first step is to appeal the decision of the visa officer to the Board in a hearing de novo. Should it make the same error as the visa officer, or a different error, the remedy is then to seek judicial review of the Board's decision in the Federal Court, trial division.
