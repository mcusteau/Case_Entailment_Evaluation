The applicant submits that the Board erred when it declined to hold whether the visa officer committed the errors of law which were alleged. The Board did so by relying on
Kahlon v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1989), 97 N.R. 349 (F.C.A.), in which the court stated at page 351 that an appeal to the Board is a "hearing de novo in a broad sense." The applicant submits that a hearing before the Board is de novo in that the Board can make different findings of fact based on the evidence which was presented to it because it is not bound by the record which was before the visa officer. However, the hearing remains an appeal from the decision of the visa officer, and the Board must rule whether the visa officer erred. The applicant submits that the Board cannot refuse to pronounce itself regarding errors of law, and the failure to do so constitutes an error which goes to jurisdiction.
