Cansino v. M.C.I.
(January 19, 1996), W94-00057 (I.A.D.), at page 6, a panel of the Board listed indicia to be considered in assessing the existence of a genuine relationship between the adopted parents and child:
(a) the motivation and intentions of the parties to the adoption;
(b) the history of the adoption and the parties to it;
(c) the nature of the pre-adoption and post-adoption relationships between the child and the adoptive and natural parents;
(d) the transfer of authority and responsibility over the adopted child between the adoptive and natural parents;
(e) the arrangements made by the adoptive and natural parents to give effect to the adoption.
"The panel notes that assessment of the indicia of a genuine relationship of parent and child will, of necessity, be contextual. Cultural, social, economic, religious and practical considerations will affect each adoptive family differently. Great care must be taken in addressing and weighing them."
