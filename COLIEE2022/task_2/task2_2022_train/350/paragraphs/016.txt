Statutory Interpretation
(Concord, Ont.: Irwin Law, 1997), at page 41, courts are to use the ordinary meaning of words if there is no reason to reject it in favour of another interpretation.
Black's Law Dictionary
, 6th Ed. (St. Paul, Minn.: West Publishing, 1990), at page 721 defines a "hearing de novo" as follows:
"Generally, a new hearing or a hearing for the second time, contemplating an entire trial in the same manner in which the matter was originally heard and a review of the present hearing. Trying matter anew the same as if it had not been heard before and as if no decision had been previously rendered ... On hearing 'de novo' court hears the matter as a court of original and not appellate jurisdiction."
The
Dictionary of Canadian Law
, 2nd Ed., (Dukelow and Nuse, Scarborough, Ont., Carswell, 1994) at page 549, defines "hearing de novo" thus:
"... [I]s ... an altogether fresh or new hearing and not limited to an enquiry to determine if the tribunal acted properly and correctly on the evidence and material before it ..."
