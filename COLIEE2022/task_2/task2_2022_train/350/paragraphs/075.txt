Finally, in
Pabla v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 2054; 198 F.T.R. 112 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Blais stated at page 12:
"2. Was the Board's assessment of the parent-child relationship reasonable?
"[25] The Board concluded that there was no genuine parent-child relationship based on the following facts:
(a) The inconsistency in the testimony between the applicant and his wife as to when the child came to live with the applicant's wife;
(b) Three different dates were given by the applicant, his wife, and the child's natural father as to when the child went to live with the applicant's wife;
(c) The child's permanent residence application indicated that she lived with her natural parents until the age of nine;
(d) The applicant did not attend the adoption ceremony, with no credible explanation;
(e) The applicant's wife has not visited the child since 1994;
(f) The applicant did not exercise parental control over the child.
"[26] Nevertheless, in my view, the Board failed to consider many other facts that were not contradicted and showed that a genuine parent-child relationship existed between the members of the family.
"[27] I concur with counsel for the applicant that in reaching the conclusion that the adoption did not create a parent-child relationship, the Tribunal ignored the evidence that:
- The child has cut off virtually all contact with its natural parents and had since the adoption lived with the power of attorney of the Applicant. Given this it is doubtful that the child could have maintained a relationship with her parents and as such if the Applicant is not to be considered the parent the child would be left with no parent. This result is of course absurd.
- The Applicant testified that he has supported the child financially since the adoption.
- The Applicant testified in addition that he sent gifts to India.
- The Applicant further testified that he visited twice yearly and stayed with the children during his visits. This is highly unusual and indicates a strong interest on the part of the applicant to maintain a close relationship with the child despite the distance.
- The Applicant testified that, while he was in India, he spent the entire time with his child.
- He testified that his wife maintained contact with the child after the marriage and that the child lived with the applicant's wife during the first years of her life so that a close relationship was established.
- He testified that the natural parents have not assisted in the financial support for the children [sic] since the adoption.
- The documentary evidence included proof of numerous phone calls to the children [sic] consistent with his evidence on this point together with affidavits attesting to the genuineness of the relationship." (Emphasis added)
