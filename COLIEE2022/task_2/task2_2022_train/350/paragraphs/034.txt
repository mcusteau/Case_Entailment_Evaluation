To address potential abuse of the immigration program, urges the Minister at paragraph 22 of her memorandum of argument, legislators specifically directed the Board to consider whether there is a genuine parent/child relationship. It is, therefore, not for the Board to look beyond the statutory test and to decide to admit a child because, notwithstanding the absence of a genuine relationship, her admission would not result in pressures on the social services system. The Immigration Appeal Division is driven to determine whether there be a genuine parent-child relationship and it ought never to duck that duty. The Board resolutely faced it, here.
