The Minister submits that the effect of
Kahlon
, supra, is that the Board may decline to rule on errors which were allegedly made by a visa officer. The Federal Court of Appeal, speaking unanimously through Mr. Justice Mahoney, stated the following at page 350:
"[4] In
Gana v. M.M.I.
, [1970] S.C.R. 699, the nature of the appeal to the Immigration Appeal Board under earlier legislation was considered. I agree with the view expressed by Thurlow, C.J., in his concurring judgment in
Mohamed v. M.E.I.
, [1986] 3 F.C. 90, at 95:
'The language of the applicable statutory provisions has been changed somewhat since the decision of the Supreme Court in
Gana v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration
, [1970] S.C.R. 699, and this court in
Srivastava v. Minister of Manpower & Immigration
, [1973] F.C. 138, were pronounced but
I think the intent of Parliament is still what it was under the former legislation, that is to say, to establish and continue as a court of record a board empowered to decide judicially the facts on which the admissibility of a person depends and not merely to pass on the procedural or substantive supportability of the administrative position on such statutory requirements taken by a visa officer.
'

The effect of that decision is, in my opinion, that the hearing of an appeal by the Immigration Appeal Board is a hearing de novo in a broad sense.
I again agree with the view of Thurlow, C.J., expressed in
Mohamed
, at p. 94:
'
In my opinion the issue to be decided by the Board on an appeal under s. 79 of the
Act
is not whether the administrative decision taken by a visa officer to refuse an application because the information before him indicated that a person seeking admission to Canada was of a prohibited class was correctly taken but the whole question whether when the appeal is being heard, the person is in fact one of the prohibited class.'
