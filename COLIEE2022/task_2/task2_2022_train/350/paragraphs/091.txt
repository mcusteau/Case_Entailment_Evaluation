The Minister submits that
Baker
, supra, does not apply to the case at bar in the manner which is urged by the applicant. The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that international instruments, although signed and ratified by Canada, have no direct application within Canadian law. Those international instruments may help to inform the contextual approach to statutory interpretation. Moreover, the decision in
Baker
was discretionary, and the court used international instruments to inform its opinion regarding a "humanitarian and compassionate" application. Here, the determination that an "adopted" child is the member of the family class is not discretionary because it involves the application of a statutory test. Consequently,
Baker
, supra, does not apply to the determination of adoption sponsorships in the manner urged by the applicant.
