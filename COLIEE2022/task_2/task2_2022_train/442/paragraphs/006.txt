The Applicant initially contacted the Commission by telephone on or about October 24, 1998. She requested the materials necessary to file a complaint. She received the materials on or about November 12, 1998 and returned the completed forms on or about November 27, 1998. In April 1999, the Applicant received a response from the Commission, advising that it could not assist her. The text of that letter provides, in part, as follows:
"Thank you for your letter of November 27, 1998, alleging that you have been discriminated against by Concord Transport and indicating that you wish to file a complaint with the Canadian Human Rights Commission.
I have carefully reviewed your correspondence and must advise you that the Commission cannot offer you assistance in this matter. Under the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, the Commission investigates allegations of discrimination in employment and in the provision of services in federal areas, on the following grounds: disability, age, religion, race, colour, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status and pardoned conviction. Individuals such as yourself may find themselves subject to what they believe to be unfair treatment. However, unless that treatment is related to one of the grounds listed above, it would not constitute discrimination under our
Act
.
Thank you for advising us of your concerns. I regret that my response cannot be more positive."
