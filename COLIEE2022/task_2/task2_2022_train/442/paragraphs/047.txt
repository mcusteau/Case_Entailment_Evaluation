[47]
In the present case, the Respondent raised no new matters in its reply submissions. The question of the timeliness of the Applicant's complaint was always an issue, whether or not it was raised by the Respondent. The
Act
provides that a complaint concerning alleged discrimination on a prohibited ground is to be filed within twelve months of the event in question, unless the Commission in its discretion decides otherwise. This limitation is provided in section 41(1)(e). The Applicant knew, or ought to have known, that she was to file her complaint within one year of the alleged discriminatory act. She was in control of initiating a complaint and she characterized the Respondent's refusal to hire Mr. Love in June 1997, as a junior driver on her truck, as a discriminatory act based on sex, that is her status as a female owner of a truck.
