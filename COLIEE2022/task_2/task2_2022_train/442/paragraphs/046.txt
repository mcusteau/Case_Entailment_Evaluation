Again I refer to
Cape Breton Development Corp.
, supra, where the Court dealt with the issue of whether cross-disclosure between the parties of such submissions is required. At paragraph 32, the Court said as follows:
"When each of the parties was advised of the 'Section 40/41 Analysis' report and of the recommendation to be made to the Commission, and was invited to comment, each was also advised that the written comments of both parties would be submitted to the Commission. In relation to the preliminary decision here in question that process, and the subsequent submission of the comments of both to the Commission, satisfied requirements of procedural fairness, without any necessity of cross-disclosure of submissions of one party to the other before the decision was made."
