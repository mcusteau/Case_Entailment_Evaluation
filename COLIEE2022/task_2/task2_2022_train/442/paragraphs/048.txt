If this refusal was indeed an act of discrimination on the basis of sex, it occurred in June 1997 and not at a later date when Mr. Love was hired by the Respondent, independent of any employment relationship between Mr. Love and the Applicant. The Commission did not address the merits of the Applicant's complaint. In light of its finding on the timeliness of that complaint, it was unnecessary to go into its merits. In dealing with the preliminary issue of timeliness, the Commission was complying with its obligation to decide whether a complaint should be subject to further action, that is an inquiry.
