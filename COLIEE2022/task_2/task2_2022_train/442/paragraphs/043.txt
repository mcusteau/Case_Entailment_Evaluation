The key factor in the Commission's decision here is its finding that the alleged discriminatory act occurred in June 1997 and not at some later date as suggested by the Applicant. The Applicant argues that she was not aware of the subsequent hiring of Mr. Love by the Respondent until May 1998. She also suggests that the date of the alleged discrimination was August 1997 when she signed the contract with the Respondent for the employment of her truck with one driver.
