In my opinion, there is no basis for interfering with the decision of the Commission to decline further inquiry into the Applicant's complaint. Such decision was not patently unreasonable. It is unnecessary to address the Respondent's arguments concerning the alleged introduction of further facts by the Applicant in her affidavit filed in this proceeding.
