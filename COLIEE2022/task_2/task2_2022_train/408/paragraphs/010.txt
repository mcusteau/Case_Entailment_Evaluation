The defendant commenced an action against the plaintiff in the Federal Court on March 21, 1987. The statement of claim in that action is attached as Exhibit F to the Affidavit of Cecile K. Solomon, Assistant General Counsel of the plaintiff. Andres asks for damages and that the registration for the trademark WILDBERRY VODKA COOLER Design be struck out. Andres claims that the trademark was not registrable by virtue of s. 12 of the Trade Marks Act and the registration is therefore invalid by virtue of s. 18 of the Act. The plaintiff apparently has represented to provincial liquor control boards that it owns the trademark WILDBERRY and any sales of Andres WILDBERRY would be an infringement of Seagram's trademark. Liquor control boards refuse to carry Andres' product.
