I have carefully examined the labels on the defendant's Wildberry cooler and the labels for its Splitz cooler "The Original" "Sunshine Splitz" "Orange" "Sunshine" "Wildberry" and carriers used. I found it significant that originally a label for Wildberry had that word to the left but the "only one now used" has moved "Wildberry" to the center of the label. (see below) That did not occur with The Original, Sunshine Splitz, Orange or Sunshine. Wildberry is clearly meant to be the eyecatcher.

The colour scheme used also tends to confusion.
