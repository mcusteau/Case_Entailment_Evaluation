Mr. David E. Hojnoski, an employee of the defendant, is an enologist (enology is the art and science of wine making). He describes "coolers" in his affidavit of April 27, 1987 as,
"Typically a wine cooler is a mixture of wine, fruit juices, fruit flavourings or other fruit substances having a character or style relative to the fruit profile, and in varying degrees of flavour intensities. Most coolers make use of wine, natural and/or artificial fruit flavours and mineral water. All of the coolers produced by the defendant contain wine. Some coolers, such as those produced by the plaintiff contain no wine, but instead distilled spirits."
