However, I am satisfied on the evidence that the defendant was comparatively new in the field with the use of the word Wildberry and has many other possibilities for the sale of coolers. It is true that sale of the defendant's product is in one province where to-date no sales have been made by the plaintiff. The trademark, issued to the plaintiff covers all of Canada and the move into the British Columbia market was imminent, in fact may have been taking place at the time the motion was heard. Sales in British Columbia alone probably wouldn't have caused irreparable harm but if the injunction were not granted, it may have unleashed several other competitors - the so-called "floodgate effect". I have grouped the issues of balance of convenience and potential damage together since the evidence relating to them is interrelated and this decision in any event is only obiter.
