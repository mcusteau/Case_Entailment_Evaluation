Madame Justice Reed, in IBM Corporation v. Spirales Inc., supra at page 199, states it this way:
"In the present case it is hard to conclude that the plaintiff would suffer irreparable harm from the actions of the defendant alone, if an injunction were not granted. This flows from one factor only - the comparative size of the two protagonists. At the same time IBM might directly suffer substantial harm, not from the direct activities of the defendant but because of the encouragement withholding an injunction would give to many others to enter into the field of importing and selling the computers containing the programme in which the plaintiff holds a certificate of copyright - a floodgates effect. Counsel for the plaintiff graphically described this as 'death by 1000 cuts'. I have no doubt that withholding an injunction would open the floodgates to extensive activity by others."
Therefore, having decided that there is arguably an infringement of the proprietary right in a trademark, that is of itself sufficient to constitute irreparable harm not compensable in damages. (Maple Leaf Mills Ltd. v. Quaker Oats Co., supra.)
