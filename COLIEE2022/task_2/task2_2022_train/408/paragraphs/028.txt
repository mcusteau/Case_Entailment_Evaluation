I am satisfied that had the plaintiff secured the trademark Wildberry, the plaintiff would have no difficulty establishing confusion. That is not the situation here. We have WILDBERRY Vodka Cooler as the registered trademark. The plaintiff has disclaimed the right to the exclusive use of vodka and cooler. The defendant makes the point it has not used the registered trademark but only a portion of it. That is sufficient use of the trademark to find infringement.
