  Had the Applicant completed the degree in the 1980s, it appears that he would have completed a three-year degree. The problem for the Applicant is that he did not complete the MBA degree until 2006. While the Applicant may have subsequently received some credit for the earlier courses, he did not complete the program. A similar situation was considered in  
 de Guzman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 1113, where Justice Pinard, at paragraph 14, concluded that, where a program of studies is not completed, the "years do not count towards his total years of education and are not relevant to this application".
