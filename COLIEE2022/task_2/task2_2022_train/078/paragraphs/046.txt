  At the time that the application of permanent residence was submitted, the Applicant's wife had an uncle in Canada. When the application was processed, the Officer noted that the uncle no longer lived in Canada; this is not disputed by the Applicant. The application listed no other relatives in Canada. Accordingly, the Officer did not award the Applicant five points for a relative in Canada.
