 [67] 
  The answer to this question could be determinative in the application before me. The Applicant was given credit for: (a) 10 years of education up to his graduation from secondary school, rather than for the 11 years that he spent in private school achieving the same result; and (b) two years for his MBA, notwithstanding that he spent the equivalent of more than three years to obtain this master's degree. Had the Applicant been awarded credit for even one additional year of education, he would have received 25 points for education and, thus, reached the qualifying threshold. In the circumstances, I am prepared to certify the same question as was certified by Justice Heneghan.
