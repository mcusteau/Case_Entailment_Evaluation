 [61] 
  Regarding the failure of the Officer to provide adequate reasons, I do not deny that  
 Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 SCR 817 suggests that, in the immigration context, generally speaking, written reasons will be required. However, this Court has repeatedly held that on a substituted evaluation, an officer does not have to provide written reasons for declining to exercise their discretion; evidence that the officer has turned his or her mind to such an evaluation is sufficient (see, for example,  
 Fernandes v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 243;  
 Poblano v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 1167;  
 Channa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1996), 124 FTR 290;  
 Feng v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1998), 153 FTR 59).
