  I also reject the Applicant's argument that he should have received credit for 11 years of primary/secondary school education. The Applicant attended a private school for 11 years. The usual course of study leading to graduation from secondary school in the Philippines is 10 years. I appreciate the Applicant's submissions that the quality of education at the private school was higher and that private education is almost an essential for someone in the Applicant's situation. However, the Applicant was awarded credit for 10 years of study because he could have obtained a secondary level of education in the Philippines after 10 years. The mode or manner of how the Applicant completed the studies - or whether the private school may have led to a better quality of education - is not relevant to the question of determining the points to be awarded (see  
 Shahid v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FCA 40 at para 31).
