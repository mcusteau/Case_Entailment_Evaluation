  The first problem that I have with the Applicant's submissions on this issue is that he now provides submissions to the Court that were not made to the Officer. If the Applicant had made those comments in the context of a request for a substituted evaluation, the Officer may have been obliged to provide further analysis and reasons. That was not done. In  
 Eslamieh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 722, Justice Mosley stated: 
 
 
 
 Visa Officers have the authority to consider an alternative evaluation under subsection 76(3) by their own motion, as held by my colleague Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson in  
 Zheng v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and immigration) 
 , 2002 FTR 1115, 26 Imm. L.R. (3d) 72. That said, it is clear from the jurisprudence that they are under no obligation to exercise that discretion unless specifically requested to do so. The applicant concedes that she did not make such a request and I cannot therefore find that the Visa Officer was unreasonable in her decision.
