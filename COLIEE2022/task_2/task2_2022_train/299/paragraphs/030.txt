The Federal Court of Appeal has had occasion to discuss the notion of unjust dismissal within the meaning of the
Code
. In
Hall√© v. Bell Canada
(1989), 99 N.R. 149 (F.C.A.), Pratte, J.A., noted the adjudicator's obligation in the course of his analysis of a dismissal:
"The question presented to him was whether the respondent had been unjustly dismissed.
In order to answer this, he first had to consider the nature, sufficiency and merits of the reasons for dismissal
. Accordingly, in the case at bar the adjudicator should have considered whether the applicant had any basis for complaint about the respondent's performance and whether this provided grounds for dismissal. [See footnote 2] If the adjudicator had answered these questions in the affirmative, he should then
have considered whether the procedure leading to dismissal of the employee was fair
." (Emphasis added)
