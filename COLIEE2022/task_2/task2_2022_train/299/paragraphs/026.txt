[26]
Having regard for the arguments advanced by the applicant, I conclude that three issues are raised in the context of this judicial review:
Did the adjudicator err in law in finding that, in the context of this case, an administrative dismissal was involved?
In the assessment of the evidence, did the adjudicator err in law in applying the legal principles pertaining to the determination of whether a dismissal was for just cause?
Did the adjudicator err in law in that she allegedly imposed on the applicant the onus of proving his employer's bad faith?
