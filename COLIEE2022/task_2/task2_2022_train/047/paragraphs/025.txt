  Based on the decision in  
 Girouard 
 , it is apparent that the standard from  
 Meiorin 
 , supra, is not an appropriate yard-stick for an appeal based on the merit principle. The purpose of an appeal under section 21 of the  
 PSEA 
  is not to identify discriminatory standards and determine whether they can be justified. Rather, its function is to ensure that the selection board made an appointment based on the merit principle. It is an Appeal Board's task to determine whether the accommodations provided to an individual allowed him or her to compete on an equal footing with the other candidates. The accommodations must be fair not only to the individual in question, but also to the other candidates.
