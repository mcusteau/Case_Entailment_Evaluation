  Appeal Board Chairperson Gohier heard testimony from the applicant, Mr. Larose, Mr. Hunter, Dr. Collins and Ms. LÃ©ger and rendered a decision on June 8, 2001. His decision can be divided into four parts. First, he found that the TSB had properly accommodated the applicant by surpassing the modified testing conditions defined by Dr. Collins. He referred to the first set of recommendations from Dr. Collins as an "unfortunate mis-communication". In the end, Dr. Collins concluded the proposed examination could be administered to the applicant if the testing conditions were altered to accommodate his condition. Second, he held that the applicant had not written the test under duress. The applicant failed to take the opportunity provided to him to comment on the accommodations. Third, he found that the TSB could not be faulted for failing to deal with the distractions, as it could not correct a situation when it was not aware of its existence. Finally, with respect to the Krupp report, the Appeal Board Chairperson deferred to the expert opinion of Dr. Collins, who had not taken exception to either the nature or the clarity of any of the exam questions and stated that the use of such questions would have actually made matters easier for the applicant.
