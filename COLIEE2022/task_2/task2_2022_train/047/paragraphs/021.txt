  In support of his position, the applicant has referred the Court to the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in  
 Public Service Employee Relations Commission (B.C.) v. British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union 
 , [1999] 3 S.C.R. 3; 244 N.R. 145; 127 B.C.A.C. 161; 207 W.A.C. 161 (hereinafter  
 Meiorin 
 ), which dealt with application of British Columbia's  
 Human Rights Code 
 , R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 210, to a public service provider. In cases concerning a complaint under provincial or federal human rights legislation, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that an employer is responsible for providing reasonable accommodation for an employee's disability short of undue hardship, see  
 Human Rights Commission (Ont.) and O'Malley v. Simpsons-Sears 
 , [1985] 2 S.C.R. 536; 64 N.R. 161; 12 O.A.C. 241,  
 Central Alberta Dairy Pool v. Human Rights Commission (Alta.) 
 , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489; 113 N.R. 161; 111 A.R. 241 and  
 Renaud v. Board of Education of Central Okanagan No. 23 and Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 523 
 , [1992] 2 S.C.R. 970; 141 N.R. 185; 13 B.C.A.C. 245; 24 W.A.C. 245. In  
 Meiorin 
  the Court undertook a reformulation of the approach used to determine whether a prima facie discriminatory standard is a bona fide occupational requirement ("BFOR"). The applicant refers specifically to step three of the new approach (see para. 54 of  
 Meiorin 
 ), where the Court stated that an employer must demonstrate it is "impossible" to accommodate individual's disability without imposing "undue hardship" upon the employer.
