  The respondent argues the  
 PSEA 
  does not empower a PSC Appeal Board to apply the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 (the " 
 CHRA 
 ") or principles applicable to human rights legislation. Legal issues such as the limits of accommodation and undue hardship are outside of the jurisdiction of a PSC Appeal Board and have been entrusted by Parliament to the Canadian Human Rights Commission. An Appeal Board only deals with the issue of reasonable accommodation from the perspective of its impact on the merit principle. In addition, an Appeal Board must also consider whether the accommodations are fair to the other candidates involved in the competition.
