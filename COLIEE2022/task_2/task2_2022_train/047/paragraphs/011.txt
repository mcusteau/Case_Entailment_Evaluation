  Dr. Collins responded in a letter dated August 25, 2000 and stated it was her belief that "the assessment process itself was inherently disadvantageous to someone like Mr. Tremblay". She went on to say: 
 
 
 
 "The main premise on which my initial recommendations were based was that the highly structured testing and interview  
 process 
  that you were proposing, regardless of its specific  
 content 
 , would place an individual with subtle MS-related information processing deficits at a disadvantage. In making the suggestions that follow, I will assume that the nature and content of your assessment tools have already been established and are not open to modification at this point. Clearly, this limits what I can suggest in the way of accommodations." (Emphasis in original.) 
 
 
 
 Dr. Collins recommended that the applicant be allowed at least double the time allotted for the examination, be given the option of completing it in two sessions on separate days, be permitted to complete the written examination individually rather than in a group to lessen the level of distraction, and to have available an individual familiar with the written examination for consultation.
