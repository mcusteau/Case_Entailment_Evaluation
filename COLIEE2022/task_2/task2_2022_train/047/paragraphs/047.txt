  I also agree with the Appeal Board Chairperson that the wisest decision was to defer to the expert opinion of Dr. Collins on this matter. She had an opportunity to review the test in question and did not find any fault with it. The applicant did not present the Krupp report to either Dr. Collins or the TSB when they were devising accommodations for him. Nor did he object to the use of true/false or multiple-choice questions at that time. The TSB made a reasonable decision based on the advice it obtained from the PPC and Dr. Collins and cannot be faulted for failing to search out and find the Krupp report.
