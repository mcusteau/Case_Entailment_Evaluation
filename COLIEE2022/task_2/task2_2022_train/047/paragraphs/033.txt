  The decision to use an alternative assessment method must also respect the rights of the other candidates to a fair assessment process. The cited guidelines contain language indicating that the use of alternative assessment methods should be limited to cases where no other form of accommodation is adequate. The Court of Appeal in  
 Girouard 
  (F.C.A.), supra, at para. 12, referred to section 1:3 of the  
 Generic Standards 
  as creating a "presumption against different methods of assessment for different candidates." Likewise, the  
 PSC Guidelines 
  stipulate that alternative assessment methods should be used "only when no modifications to a test and/or testing conditions are judged appropriate." The responsibility of balancing these competing interests and deciding if an alternative assessment format is warranted lies with the relevant selection board. As outlined above, it is not a question of whether it is impossible to accommodate a disabled candidate, but rather a question of what method of assessment is needed to ensure a selection based on merit.
