  The Appeal Board Chairperson addressed the substance of the summary of the Krupp report in his decision. He stated: 
 
 
 
 "With respect to the summary of the study conducted by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, I note that the portion entitled 'Study Design' specifically stated that all of the participants in the study were subjected to the  
 exact same 
  testing conditions (a four hour exam). The study then concluded that ' 
 (t)hese findings show that people with MS experience more cognitive fatigue following a continuous, effortful, cognitive task than people who do not have MS. 
 ' That this is so is neither new, nor is it in dispute. In fact, it was this very concept that led to the first appeal being allowed and the ensuing search for appropriate measures to accommodate the appellant. On a separate matter, the record should note that I am not persuaded that this study supports the appellant's contention that true/false questions or multiple-choice questions should not have been used in the written exam he was given. On that particular issue, I will defer to the expert opinion expressed by Dr. Collins that she had not taken exception to either the nature or the clarity of any of the exam questions, and that the use of such questions would actually make matters easier for the appellant, not worse.
