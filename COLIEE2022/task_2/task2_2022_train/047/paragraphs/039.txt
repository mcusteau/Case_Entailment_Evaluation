  The Appeal Board Chairperson dismissed the applicant's argument at para. 46 of his reasons: 
 
 
 
 "I also cannot retain the appellant's contention that he had accepted under duress, the corrective measures described to him in Ms. Henry's letter of September 15th, 2001. If he disagreed with any of these corrective measures, then he should have taken the opportunity offered to him to comment on them and suggested improvements. He did not do so. In any event, the matter is moot since the appellant had an opportunity to present his case fully before me."
