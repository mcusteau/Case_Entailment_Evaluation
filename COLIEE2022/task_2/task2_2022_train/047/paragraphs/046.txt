  The Appeal Board did not make an error when it excluded the full Krupp report. Administrative decision-makers are generally given some discretion as to what evidence will be accepted. On questions concerning the admissibility of evidence before an administrative tribunal, the Court is unlikely to interfere unless the decision constitutes a breach of natural justice, see  
 Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières v. Syndicat des employés professionnels de l'Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières 
 , [1993] 1 S.C.R. 471; 148 N.R. 209; 53 Q.A.C. 171; 101 D.L.R.(4th) 494. In light of the lateness of the request and the fact that a summary had already been provided, the Appeal Board Chairperson properly exercised his discretion in excluding the Krupp report. Between the summary of Krupp report and viva voce evidence of Dr. Collins, the Appeal Board Chairperson had a wealth of evidence the concerning the difficulties faced by MS patients. Consequently, his decision to exclude the Krupp report did not prejudice the applicant's ability to present his case.
