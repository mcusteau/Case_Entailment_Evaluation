  Having said that, human rights principles need not be placed in a separate water-tight compartment from the merit principle as they may have limited applicability in a section 21 appeal. The Appeal Board in  
 Girouard 
  erred by focussing strictly on human rights principles and ignoring the merit principle, see  
 Girouard 
  (F.C.T.D.) at para. 32. However, there is nothing wrong with drawing upon human rights principles, as Cullen, J., did in  
 Schut v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1998] F.T.R. Uned. 327; [1998] F.C.J. No. 806 (T.D.), at para. 14, as long as they are utilised as part of an appropriate analysis under the merit principle. Human rights cases may provide a rich source of jurisprudence for an Appeal Board or a Court to draw upon when determining whether an individual has been provided with reasonable accommodations in light of the merit principle.
