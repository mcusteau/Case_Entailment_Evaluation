  The Public Service Commission's  
 Guidelines for Assessing Persons with Disabilities 
  (the " 
 PSC Guidelines 
 ") also identify alternative assessment methods as an acceptable alternative to standard tests. Dr. Collins was provided with a copy of the  
 PSC Guidelines 
  when conducting her initial assessment and relied upon general guideline number 10, which states: 
 
 
 
 "10. USE ALTERNATIVE ASSESSMENT METHODS, IF NECESSARY 
 
 
 
 "When standard tests cannot be modified to appropriately assess a candidate with a disability, alternative assessment techniques may be used. If a standard paper-and-pencil test cannot be appropriately modified, the qualification may be assessed using other methods such as a structured performance task, questionnaire, interview and/or review of past performance. 
 
 
 
 " 
 It is important to note that this is not an exemption from assessment of qualifications, but an alternative means of assessing the same qualification, and should be used only when no modifications to a test and/or testing conditions are judged appropriate. A test score cannot be assigned in cases where no test is being used, but a judgment could be made regarding the extent to which the qualification assessed by an alternative method meets the requirement for the position.
