  The examination was administered individually to the applicant on October 4 and 5, 2000. On October 4, the applicant was distracted by the clicking noise of an electronically controlled door, but did not mention it to the test administrator. On October 5, the applicant found the noise of the door combined with voices from employees having a discussion nearby too much to handle, and asked to be moved to another room. He was promptly relocated to Mr. Hunter's office. At first, he found the office to be nice and quiet, but was later distracted by noise from construction work taking place on the street below. He did not mention the distraction to anyone as he thought those in charge had done enough already and he did not want to make anyone angry.
