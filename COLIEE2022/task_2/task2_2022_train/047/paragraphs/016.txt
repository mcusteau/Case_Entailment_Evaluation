  The fundamental principle underlying appointments to or from within the federal public service is the merit principle, which is contained in section 10(1) of the  
 PSEA 
 : 
 
 
 
 " 
 Appointments to be based on merit 
 
 
 
 "10(1) Appointments to or from within the Public Service shall be based on selection according to merit, as determined by the Commission, and shall be made by the Commission, at the request of the deputy head concerned, by competition or by such other process of personnel selection designed to establish the merit of candidates as the Commission considers is in the best interests of the Public Service."
