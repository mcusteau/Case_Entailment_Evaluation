On June 10, 2001, Mr. Aslam and his family visited his sister in law. The youngest son, Haseeb, was kidnapped by the SSP while playing outside the house. Mr. Aslam reported this to the police. He then received threatening phone calls at his sister in law's house, telling him that he should not have reported the kidnapping to the police and demanding a ransom. On June 13, 2001, the Shia community members held a rally to demand the return of Haseeb and condemn the killing of Shias. The next day, Mr. Aslam's cousin and brother went to Jhang to pay the ransom and Haseeb was returned to the family. Later, he was informed that he had been charged under section 16 of Maintenance of Public Order because it was alleged he was involved with the rally. Shortly after, he received a phone call telling him that this had been a warning and that if he mentioned the SSP in connection with the kidnapping he would be killed.
