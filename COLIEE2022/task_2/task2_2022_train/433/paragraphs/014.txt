On June 15, 2001, Mr. Aslam returned to Karachiwith his family. He submitted new applications for Canadian Visitor's Visas to the Islamabad High Commission on July 3, 2001. His wife and children were issued Visas and left for Canada on July 12, 2001. As his lawyer advised him that he should travel separately from his family, he joined them in Canada on August 25, 2001. Through his brother and a friend, he was directed to a lawyer to help them file refugee claims. As the lawyer was out of the office on holiday, the refugee claims were not completed until September 18, 2001.
