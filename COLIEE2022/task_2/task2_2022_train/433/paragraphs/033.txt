This Court has had the opportunity to review the assessment of state protection in Pakistan in several recent judicial review applications. These cases reinforce the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration's view that where there is some evidence which supports the Board's conclusions and where the Board has referred to relevant documentary evidence, the Court should not interfere. The Board is not obliged to find that there is perfect state protection available to the Aslam family. (Villafranca; Hussain; Ahmad; Akhtar) [see footnote 11]
