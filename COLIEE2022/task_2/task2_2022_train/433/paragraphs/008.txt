On February 6, 1996, he alleges that a group of people arrived at his factory in the middle of the night. They asked for him and beat up the watchman and some of the workers. They shouted that the factory belonged to Shias and should thus be damaged and destroyed. They broke the gate and entered the factory. They set fire to the factory, burning the cloth and machines and greatly damaging the building. One of the workers called Mr. Aslam at home and he went to the factory which was close to his home. When he arrived on the scene, the factory was on fire and he called the fire brigade. An injured worker was taken to the hospital but he died shortly after. The police arrived on the scene. In the morning, Mr. Aslam went to the police station with some members of his community to report the incident. The police told him they were aware of the incident.
