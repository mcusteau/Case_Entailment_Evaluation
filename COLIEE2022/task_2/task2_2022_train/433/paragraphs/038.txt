There is nothing to indicate that Mr. Aslam could not find adequate employment in Islamabad. He has ten years education and transferable work experience. Ms. Aslam has 14 years education, a BA degree and experience as a teacher. There is no evidence that in Islamabad the children would not be exposed to adequate schooling. There was no evidence before the Board that the Aslam family will lack medical attention or face other physical hardship in Islamabad. The Board found that the kind of hardship the Aslam family may face in moving to Islamabad is the hardship associated with relocation and dislocation and is not the kind of hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable.
