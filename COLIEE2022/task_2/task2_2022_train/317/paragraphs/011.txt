In the present matter, the RPD noted that the Applicants was allegedly threatened and harassed by Mr. Segura's henchmen, but also mentioned that Segura is, according to the Applicants, very well connected to the police (RPD decision, p. 5). In the Applicant's narrative (p. 29, tribunal's file), the Applicant mentioned that "certain government official were co-operating with Comunicon to get rid of [him]". There is no evidence to support these allegations. Further, I understand from the Applicant's narrative that the threats were more likely to be originating from private parties, namely Comunico and Mr. Segura, who had a personal pecuniary interest in excluding the Applicant from the deal with the Mexican government. Having read the evidence, it is hard for me to believe that the Mexican police and government as a whole collaborated to threaten and harass the Applicants. In addition, the RPD cited the documentary evidence on the reliability of the system in place in Mexico and the failure of the Applicant to take any reasonable steps to seek protection. It appears from the evidence that the only remedies sought were of civil nature, not criminal. The lawyer's letter mentions that "related complaints" were made in September 2003, but no details are provided as to the nature of these complains (p. 284 to 291). There is no evidence that any action was taken or any complaint made to the Mexican authorities to prevent violent reprisal against the Applicants.
