[10]
Counsel for the applicant recommended certification of a question on the issue of calculation of net worth under the definition "investor". Counsel for the respondent recommended against certifying a question and urged that the basis for calculation of net worth under the definition "investor" was clear and unambiguous. I am in agreement with the position of counsel for the respondent. No question will be certified.
Application dismissed.
