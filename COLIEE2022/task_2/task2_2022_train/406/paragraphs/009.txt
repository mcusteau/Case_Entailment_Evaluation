As indicated earlier in these reasons, there are three elements to the definition "investor" in the
Immigration Regulations
. They are joined by the conjunctive "and". To qualify in the investor category, the applicant had to satisfy the visa officer that he fulfilled all three elements of the definition "investor". While I am satisfied that the visa officer made a reviewable error in determining, on the basis that he did, that the applicant had not successfully operated a business, I am equally satisfied that the visa officer made no reviewable error in calculating the net worth of the applicant, accumulated by his own endeavours. Thus, I conclude that the visa officer was justified in the decision that he reached and that no basis exists for setting aside the visa officer's decision, taken as a whole. In the result, this application for judicial review will be dismissed.
