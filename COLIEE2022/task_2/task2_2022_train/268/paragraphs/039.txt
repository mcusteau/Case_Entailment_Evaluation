In the First Order, Prothonotary Milczynski's conclusion was that "An order respecting the confidentiality of only certain information shall issue, that being information regarding the comparative bioequivalence of Novopharm's lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg delayed-release capsules, and the specific formulation of the capsules' non-medicinal ingredients." This conclusion determined the scope of paragraph 5 of the Second Order. The basis for this conclusion was that "Novopharm has not established to my satisfaction that all of the material in the ANDS should be treated as confidential." In Novopharm's submission, Prothonotary Milczynski was clearly wrong when she granted a protective order, in the form of the Second Order, that did not include within its scope at least the materials ordered to be produced under the Disclosure Order. The relationship between s. 6(7) and 6(8) of the
Regulations
and, in particular, the mandatory language of s. 6(8), requires that these materials must be treated confidentially. As such, Novopharm says that s. 6(8) should, on its own, have been sufficient to satisfy Prothonotary Milczynski that those materials had to be treated as confidential and protected by a protective order.
