What appears to have troubled Prothonotary Milczynski about Novopharm's approach to the Protective Order is that Novopharm failed to elaborate or specify the type of information for which it sought protection and relied instead upon general assertions that all of the material in an ANDS is necessarily confidential. In fact, it would appear that Mr. Windross did not attest to having reviewed the Novopharm ANDS. He appears to assert that, because an ANDS is always confidential, all of the Novopharm ANDS is confidential.
