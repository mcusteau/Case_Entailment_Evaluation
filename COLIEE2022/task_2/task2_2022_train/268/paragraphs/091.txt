In essence, Novopharm says that the mandatory language of s. 6(8) of the
Regulations
("A document produced under s. (7) shall be treated confidentially") requires that the materials that Prothonotary Lafreni√®re ordered produced under s. 6(7) be treated confidentially. Prothonotary Milczynski should have used s. 6(8) on its own as the basis for a Protective Order that would have covered all of the materials produced under s. 6(7), and the fact that she did not do so means that her decision was clearly wrong.
