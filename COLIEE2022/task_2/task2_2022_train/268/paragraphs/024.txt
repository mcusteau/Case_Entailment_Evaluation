As explained by Mr. Windross, Novopharm takes the position that a significant reason for the confidential treatment of the materials, information and documentation in Novopharm's submission is that if a third party were to obtain this information, particularly a third party pharmaceutical company, Novopharm's business interests could be severely and negatively affected. Until Novopharm is able to take its lansoprazole delayed release capsules to market, Novopharm says it is vital that information relating to those capsules be kept strictly confidential so as not to allow other pharmaceutical companies to use Novopharm's formulation and other information to prepare and market their own generic lansoprazole delayed release capsules.
