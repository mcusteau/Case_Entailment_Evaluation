. In
Merck Frosst Canada & Co. v. Canada (Minister of Health)
(2004), 256 F.T.R. 255; 33 C.P.R.(4th) 211 (F.C.) ("
Merck Frosst
"), this Court stated:
"Basing myself on
AB Hassle
, supra, I have no hesitation in finding that the information when submitted was confidential, was always treated by Merck Frosst as confidential, and that Merck Frosst has a legitimate expectation that the information would be kept in confidence by Health Canada.
"Some of that information appears to be currently in the public domain. However ... the question is not really whether or not there is information in the public domain concerning SINGULAR J (TM), the question is whether the information as presented by Merck Frosst is in the public domain. If that information in the form presented 'comme telle' (as such) is not in the public domain, confidentiality has not, in my opinion, been lost. ...
"What is important here is the context in which the information is situated within the records held by the government."
