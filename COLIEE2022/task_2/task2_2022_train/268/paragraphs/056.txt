As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in
AB Hassle
, protective orders in cases under the
Regulations
do not prevent the parties to the application from having access to the materials in issue, only the public. According to the Federal Court of Appeal, there is
"... little, if any, public interest in knowing the specific content of drug processes and
no one can seriously argue that the issuance of protective orders of the type at issue in NOC proceedings imperils the principle of open justice
." (Emphasis added)
