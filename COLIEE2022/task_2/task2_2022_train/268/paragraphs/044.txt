Novopharm argues that Prothonotary Lafreni√®re inadvertently decided the Protective Order motion by ordering disclosure under s. 6(7) of the
Regulations
. Novopharm claims that such a Disclosure Order automatically justifies a Protective Order. Abbott submits that such a rule would be entirely contrary to
Sierra Club
, which requires that any breach of the open court rule, with the corresponding breach of the right to freedom of expression protected by s. 2(b) of the
Charter
, be specifically justified by close scrutiny of the information that a party seeks to exclude from the public record.
