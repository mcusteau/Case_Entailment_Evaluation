The importance of Dr. Liston's evidence for Prothonotary Milczynski's decision was that he was able to speak to the contents of an ANDS and the general policies of the Ministry. The only point that Prothonotary Milczynski singles out is the one which supports the position that blanket confidentiality comes to an end at some time. Whatever the shortcomings of the evidence (and both sides had difficulty in presenting direct evidence on point) I do not believe they undermine the fundamental decision that Prothonotary Milczynski made to the effect that the onus was on Novopharm to satisfy the

test and Novopharm's own evidence, given by Mr. Windross, was not enough to do this.
