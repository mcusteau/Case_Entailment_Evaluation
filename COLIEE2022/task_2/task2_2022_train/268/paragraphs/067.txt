Justice Iacobucci, in
Sierra Club
, explained at paras. 53, 56 what is required to satisfy the burden on the "commercial interest" part of the test:
"... In order to qualify as an 'important commercial interest', the interest in question cannot merely be specific to the party requesting the order; the interest must be one which can be expressed in terms of a public interest in confidentiality. For example, a private company could not argue simply that the existence of a particular contract should not be made public because to do so would cause the company to lose business, thus harming its commercial interests ... if there is no general principle at stake, there can be no 'important commercial interest' for the purposes of this test. Or, in the words of Binnie, J., in
F.N. (Re)
, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 880; 2000 SCC 35, at para. 10, the open court rule only yields 'where the public interest in confidentiality outweighs the public interest in openness' (emphasis added [by Iacobucci, J.]).
"In addition to the above requirement, courts must be cautious in determining what constitutes an 'important commercial interest'. It must be remembered that a confidentiality order involves an infringement on freedom of expression takes place under the second branch of the test, courts must be alive to the fundamental importance of the open court rule. See generally Muldoon, J., in
Eli Lilly and Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.
(1994), 56 C.P.R.(3d) 437 (F.C.T.D.), at p. 439."
