Furthermore, Novopharm reiterates that the evidence of Dr. Liston and the analysis of Prothonotary Milczynski incorrectly focus on the information within the documents, rather than the documents themselves. As explained by Mr. Windross in his evidence, which Novopharm says was misapprehended by Prothonotary Milczynski, the focus of the inquiry should be on the documents themselves and the context in which the information within those documents can be found. Novopharm says this is the relevant inquiry, as it is the documents that must be produced, not simply the information contained in them. In failing to consider and apply Mr. Windross' evidence, and in preferring the approach of Dr. Liston, Novopharm says that Prothonotary Milczynski made her decision based upon a wrong principle, misapprehended the evidence, and was clearly wrong.
