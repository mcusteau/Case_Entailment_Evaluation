It was the evidence of Mr. Windross, that Form 3011, one of the documents found in Novopharm's ANDS and ordered to be produced in this case, contains strictly confidential information concerning the non-medicinal ingredients used in Novopharm's formulation. At paragraph 13 of his affidavit, sworn April 14, 2005, Mr. Windross stated that:
"... sections of the Form 3011 such as the related submission information, the proposed shelf life,
the non-medicinal ingredients
and the proposed indication/use sections all contain information that is
strictly confidential to Novopharm, has never been public and would not be provided by Novopharm to anyone but Health Canada without the protection of its confidentiality
