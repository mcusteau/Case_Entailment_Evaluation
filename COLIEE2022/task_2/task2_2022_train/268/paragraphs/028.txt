The test on an appeal from the order of a prothonotary was recently confirmed and clarified by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Merck & Co. v. Apotex Inc.
(2003), 30 C.P.R.(4th) 40 (F.C.A.), where it stated that:
"Discretionary orders of prothonotaries ought not be disturbed on appeal to a judge unless:
a) The questions raised in the motion are vital to the final issue of the case, or
b) The orders are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts."
