Important passages of the reasons in the First Order are found at pages 6 and 9 and read as follows:
"In this case, I find that with limited exceptions, Novopharm has failed to discharge its onus. As discussed further below, the motion is granted only in part. An order respecting the confidentiality of only certain information shall issue, that being information regarding the comparative bioequivalence of Novopharm's lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg delayed-release capsules, and the specific formulation of the capsules non-medicinal ingredients.
"Novopharm has not established to my satisfaction that all of the material in the ANDS should be treated as confidential, the only exceptions being information about the comparative bioequivalence of Novopharm's lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg delayed-release capsules, and the specific formulation of the capsules' non-medicinal ingredients, exceptions that appeared to be acknowledged (if not conceded) by Abbott."
