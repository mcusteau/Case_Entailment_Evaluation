Elsewhere in the May 6th Order, Prothonotary Milczynski specifically finds that Novopharm has met its evidentiary onus with respect to certain information. At page 6 of the May 6th Order, she writes:
"In this case, I find that
with limited exceptions
, Novopharm has failed to discharge its onus. As discussed further below, the motion is granted only in part. An order respecting the confidentiality of only certain information shall issue, that being information regarding the comparative bioequivalence of Novopharm's lansoprazole 15 mg and 30 mg delayed-release capsules, and the specific formulation of the capsules non-medicinal ingredients."
