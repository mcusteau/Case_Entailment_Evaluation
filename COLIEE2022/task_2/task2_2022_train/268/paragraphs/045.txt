Abbott says that s. 6(8) deals with the obligation of a party receiving information pursuant to s. 6(7) to treat it confidentially. It does not indicate whether documents will be accessible to the public when filed in Court. Abbott argues that the subsection merely creates an obligation of confidence akin to an implied undertaking which prevents the recipient of the compelled information from disclosing it. It does not create a general public policy that every piece of paper in a submission is confidential.
