The Band Council claims that it would have prevailed had the proceedings gone to hearing. However, the fact is that the two proceedings were settled by the parties without any concessions having been made by the parties. In the absence of a hearing on the merits, “success” is an elusive concept, and capable of being measured quite differently by the parties. The Minutes of Settlement cannot be construed as evidence of an admission or concession of liability for costs or wrongdoing by the Claimants.
