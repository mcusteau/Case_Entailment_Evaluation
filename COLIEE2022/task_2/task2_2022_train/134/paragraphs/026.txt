  I have not been persuaded that the PRRA officer correctly assessed the applicant's particular circumstances. She disagreed that he would be particularly vulnerable as a result of the car injuries he has sustained. She also found that he would be able to prove his identity which would facilitate his travel to Sri Lanka and his residency in Colombo. She then stated: "It is reasonable to expect the applicant to seek the support of the more than 250,000 Tamils who live in the capital city" (T.R., p. 15).
