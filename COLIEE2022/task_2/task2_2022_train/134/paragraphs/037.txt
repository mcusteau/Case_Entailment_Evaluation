 [37] 
  The Federal Court of Appeal dealt with this issue at length in  
 Mancia 
   
 v. 
   
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1998] F.C.J. No. 565 (QL) [ 
 Mancia 
 ]. Called upon to determine whether a Post Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada officer violates the principle of fairness when he or she fails to disclose, in advance of determining the matter, documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions, Justice DÃ©cary first summarized the case law with the following two propositions: 
 
 
 
 [22] [...] First, an applicant is deemed to know from his past experience with the refugee process what type of evidence of general country conditions the immigration officer will be relying on and where to find that evidence; consequently, fairness does not dictate that he be informed of what is available to him in documentation centres. Secondly, where the immigration officer intends to rely on evidence which is not normally found, or was not available at the time the applicant filed his submissions, in documentation centres, fairness dictates that the applicant be informed of any novel and significant information which evidences a change in the general country conditions that may affect the disposition of the case.
