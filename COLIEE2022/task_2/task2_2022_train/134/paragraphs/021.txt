  A PRRA officer's decision considered globally and as a whole should be assessed on a standard of reasonableness  
 simpliciter 
 , as determined in  
 Figurado 
   
 v. 
   
 Canada (Solicitor General) 
 , 2005 FC 347. That being said, each particular finding must be reviewed according to its nature. Considering the specialized expertise in risk assessment of PRRA officers, their findings of fact should therefore be reviewed on a standard of patent unreasonableness, while questions of mixed law and fact will be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness and questions of law on a standard of correctness:
