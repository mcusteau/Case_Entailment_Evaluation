  The applicant asserts that the PRRA officer did not apply the correct standard in her section 96 analysis. It is true, as stated by the respondent, that the officer knew what the proper standard is. Indeed, she concludes her assessment with the following paragraph: 
 
 
 
 Based on the totality of evidence before me, I find that there is less than a serious possibility that the applicant would be subjected to persecution as described in Section 96 of the IRPA. The applicant can safely return to Sri Lanka to reside in Colombo. Similarly, there are no substantial grounds to believe that the applicant would face a risk of torture; nor are there reasonable grounds to believe he would face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment as described in paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of IRPA, if returned to Sri Lanka.
