  In the case at bar, I believe the PRRA officer was entitled to rely on the UK Home Office Operational Guidance Note for Sri Lanka, since this is a publicly available document from a reliable and well-known website. The fact that the report is not contained in the IRB reference material does not mean that it is not publicly available. While I am not prepared to accept that every document available on the internet is "publicly available" for the purpose of determining what fairness requires in the context of a PRRA, since this would impose an insurmountable burden on the applicant as virtually everything is nowadays accessible on line, I am of the view that the specific document under challenge here could be consulted by the PRRA officer without advising the applicant. In many respects, it merely confirms and collects the evidence available from other sources. It does not reveal novel and significant changes in the general country conditions, even if it is not entirely parallel with the findings reported in the UNHCR document. Indeed, it seems to me the PRRA officer erred not so much in considering the Home Office document, but in not discussing the contradictory findings of the UNHCR.
