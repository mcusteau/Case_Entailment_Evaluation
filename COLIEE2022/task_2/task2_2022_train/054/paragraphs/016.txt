  Had the Panel properly found that the marriage between Ms. Ouk and Mr. Thorn was not genuine, it would have had to find also that the second step of the  
 Donkor 
  test was not met in order to refuse the sponsorship on the grounds of s. 4 of the  
 Regulations 
 . In order for the Panel to find that Ms. Ouk and Mr. Thorn's marriage was primarily entered into for the purpose of gaining status or privilege under the 
   
 Act 
 , it must be able to show that that finding is based on the evidence. I can find no analysis or reasoning in the transcript or reasons for the decision, which supports a finding that the primary purpose of this marriage was to gain status or privilege under the 
   
 Act 
 .
