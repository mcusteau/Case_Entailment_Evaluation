  The evaluation of a marriage for the purpose of Regulation 4 was recently revisited in  
 Donkor 
 , supra, in which the test from  
 Horbas v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1985] 2 F.C. 359 (T.D.), was restated in these terms: 
 
 
 
 "1. The genuineness of relationship must be considered in the present tense such that a relationship that may not have been 'genuine' at the outset may have become genuine; and 
 
 
 
 2. Consideration must be given as to whether the relationship was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the 
   
 Act 
 ." 
 
 
 
 This is a cumulative test, such that both prongs must be found to be true before a marriage will be found not to be genuine for the purposes of Regulation 4.
