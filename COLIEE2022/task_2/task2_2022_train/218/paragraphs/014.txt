  The difficulty with the Board's emphasis on the actions of these applicants is this: the evidence on the record was that the persecution suffered by the applicants was from a right-wing movement, and that the particular acts of violence and harassment were perpetrated indiscriminately. As a result, one must ask: "What difference would it have made if the applicants had more diligently reported and followed up with the police, and the individuals responsible for the various acts of violence had been caught?" Based on the record, one can only conclude nothing, or at the very most very little would have changed: persecution against the Roma in Hungary is widespread and in most cases indiscriminate. As a result, the state would be offering no more "protection" than it did prior the particular acts of persecution.
