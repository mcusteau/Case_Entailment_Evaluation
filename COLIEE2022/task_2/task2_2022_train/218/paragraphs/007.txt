  In September 2009, Mr. Majoros "and his wife were spat upon and assaulted by 5-6 large men while waiting for a bus. Luckily, people passing by called the police however, because the police could not find the assailants, they started a case against 'unknown assailants' and never contacted the claimants afterwards." The applicants were unable to provide a description of the attackers or a license plate number to assist the police.
