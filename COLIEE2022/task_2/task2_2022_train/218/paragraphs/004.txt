  In 2007, Mr. Majoros and some of his Roma friends attended a disco in the town of Hars√°ny, Hungary, and fled when a group of racists armed with "bats, kaszas, swords and other farm implements came in looking for a fight." He and twelve others fled in a car, "some inside, some hanging onto the outside," and were stopped by a police car for speeding and having too many people in the car. Although those stopped explained they were merely fleeing the scene at the disco, which they described to the police, the police fined them anyway but said that they "would go to the disco and ask around and get back to them." Mr. Majoros did not follow up with the police about this incident, nor did he hear back from the police.
