  In 2008, Mr. Majoros "attended a Roma celebration during which the Guardists broke in and started a brawl. The Guardists were outnumbered but during this altercation [Mr. Majoros'] godfather was stabbed. By the time the police arrived, the assailants were gone." Mr. Majoros wrote in his Personal Information Form that because they were gone, "the police said they could not act."
