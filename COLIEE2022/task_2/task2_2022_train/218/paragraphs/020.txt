  As I stated above, what the Board fails to address is the question: how would state protection be more forthcoming if the applicants had followed up with, e.g., the Minorities Ombudsman's Office? Would they be  
 any 
  safer or any more protected? Again, instead of treating the applicants' interactions with the police as having evidentiary relevance to the legal issue -  
 Is state protection available? 
  - the Board treated the applicants' (in its view) inadequate efforts in relation to the police as a disqualifier for refugee protection. To repeat: that was an error.
