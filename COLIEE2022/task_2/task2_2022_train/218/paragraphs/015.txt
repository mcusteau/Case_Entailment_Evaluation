  Justice Kane offered a similar observation in  
 Ferko v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2012 FC 1284 at para 49: 
 
 
 
 The applicant reported every incident of violence to the police, yet he and his family continued to be victims of violence in each community they moved to. The Board accepted that the applicant's reports to the police did not result in any suspect being apprehended. Even if they had, this would not necessarily have resulted in any future protection for the applicant's family since nothing suggests that they were repeatedly targeted by the same individual(s). Rather, the applicant and his family were the victims of a broader pattern of violence by 'skin heads' against the Roma.  
 It is, therefore, not apparent what the purpose would be for the applicant to continue to request status reports from the police about the incidents reported. It is not apparent how that would have increased state protection to him and his family
