  The applicant does not contest the Board's credibility findings. However, she strongly contests the correctness of the Board's legal approach and reasonableness of its analysis of the evidence regarding the political nature of gang violence in Haiti and the gender-targeted nature of rape in Haiti. The standard of review for questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law is reasonableness ( 
 New Brunswick (Board of Management) v. Dunsmuir 
 , [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190; 372 N.R. 1; 329 N.B.R.(2d) 1; 844 A.P.R. 1; 2008 SCC 9, at paragraph 51). However, the Board's legal interpretation of sections 96 and 97 of the  
 Act 
 , including key elements inherent in the Refugee definition (i.e. persecution and nexus), is reviewable under a correctness standard.
