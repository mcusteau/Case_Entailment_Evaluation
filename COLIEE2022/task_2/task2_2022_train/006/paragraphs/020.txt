 [20] 
  Disagreeing with the respondent's assertion that the judgment in  
 Soimin 
 , above, was determinative, the Court stated in  
 Dezameau 
 , above, at paragraph 22, that the question "is whether the Board's finding that the applicant faced a risk of general criminality such that there is no nexus between her risk and her social group is defensible in law or in fact". In allowing the judicial review application, the Court concluded that "the error of the Board was to use its finding of widespread risk of violence to rebut the assertion that there is a nexus between the applicant's social group and the risk of rape" ( 
 Dezameau 
 , above, at paragraph 23).
