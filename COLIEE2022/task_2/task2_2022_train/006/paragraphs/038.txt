  The impugned decision was made on May 25, 2010, that is only four months after the earthquake of January 12, 2010 in Haiti. Before this Court, the applicant alleges that "[t]here is a rape epidemic in Haiti, exacerbated by the earthquake". It would appear that since the earthquake, some 1.5 million persons have been displaced and are living in close proximity in camps or elsewhere in extreme conditions and without adequate protection, as the case may be. Considering that fear of persecution is forward-looking, the Court expects that there will be a complete and objective evaluation of the most up-to-date documentation with respect to rape and sexual abuse committed against women and children in Haiti in light of the particular situation of the applicant and increasingly worsening country conditions.
