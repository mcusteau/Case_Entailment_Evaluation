  Canadian jurisprudence is also emphatic on the point. For example, in  
 R. v. Osolin 
 , [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595; 162 N.R. 1; 38 B.C.A.C. 81; 62 W.A.C. 81, Justice Cory for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada stated that "it cannot be forgotten that a sexual assault is very different from other assaults. It is true that it, like all the other forms of assault, is an act of violence. Yet it is something more than a simple act of violence. Sexual assault is in the vast majority of cases gender based. It is an assault upon human dignity and constitutes a denial of any concept of equality for women" ( 
 Osolin 
 , above, at paragraph 165).
