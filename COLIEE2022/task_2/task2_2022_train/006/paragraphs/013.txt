  In dismissing the judicial review application, the Court in  
 Soimin 
 , above, simply accepted that in light of section 97 of the  
 Act 
 , the claimant was not a "person in need of protection". Apparently, her risk of being kidnapped and raped was no different from that faced by other individuals from her country, but in the Court's decision, there was no specific mention or analysis of the documentary evidence. Moreover, there was no analysis by the Court of relevant legal principles or case law with respect to gender-related claims under section 96 of the  
 Act 
 .
