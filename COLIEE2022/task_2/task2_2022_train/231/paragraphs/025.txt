Finally, with respect to the October 21, 1992 decisions, I would observe that it was the Acting Deputy Commissioner who was deciding not to alter the September 10, 1992 decisions of his superior, the Deputy Commissioner. My decision that the October 21, 1992 decisions of the Acting Deputy Commissioner did not conform with normal standards of procedural fairness is not based on this point. However, I must say that I have serious doubt that a subordinate can approach the question of altering his superior's prior decision with the objectivity and independence that is required for a fair decision.
