Subsequent to filing the responses, Ms. Pawliuk obtained further particulars of the alleged conspiracy. These further particulars had been made available by prison officials to another of the alleged co-conspirators Martino Rocha. As a result of coming into possession of this further information, Ms. Pawliuk filed further submissions on October 6, 1992. In the case of Mr. Lee the further submission was sent to the National Review Committee because of the advise given to Ms. Pawliuk by the respondent that her earlier submission had been forwarded to the National Review Committee. In the case of Mr. Mathieson the further submission was made to the respondent.
