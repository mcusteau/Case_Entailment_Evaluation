The question then arises whether, notwithstanding the deficiencies associated with the September 10, 1992 decisions, the situation was cured by the subsequent decisions of Mr. Sawatzky on October 21, 1992, after which submissions on behalf of the applicants had been filed. I am of the view that it was not. First, additional information was provided to counsel with the October 21, 1992 decisions. Although Mr. Sawatzky was of the view that the substance of the information he was providing with these decisions was not inconsistent with information already given to the applicants, there are some apparent differences. For example, the name of an additional alleged conspirator was included in the subsequent information but not in the original information. A more detailed explanation of the alleged arrangements for the prison escape was also given. This was information Mr. Sawatzky had when he made his decision not to alter the original decisions. The applicants did not have that information and were therefore unable to use it in formulating their responses. "The burden is always on the authorities to demonstrate that they have withheld only such information as is strictly necessary for that purpose" (
Demaria v. Regional Classification Board
, [1987] 1 F.C. 74; 69 N.R. 135 at pp. 77-78 F.C.). It is not for the decision-maker to pick and choose the information that will be disclosed to various inmates. All information in his possession that is relevant must be disclosed unless to do so would reveal the identity of informants. When he made his October 21, 1992 decisions, Mr. Sawatsky did not have the benefit of the applicants' submissions on the additional information which he provided to Ms. Pawliuk with those decisions. Again, the applicants were denied a fair hearing and decisions were made contrary to the principles of procedural fairness.
