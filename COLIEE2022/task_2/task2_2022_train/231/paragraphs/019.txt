As I have indicated, the commissioner's directives themselves do not have the force of law. While nothing in the material suggests that the Acting Warden was not, in good faith, trying to adhere to the guidelines in the commissioner's directives, I am nonetheless forced to conclude that the decision to refuse an extension of time was unnecessary and arbitrary and had the result of denying to the applicants their rights to have their positions considered by the respondent before making his transfer decisions. I come to this decision bearing in mind the admonitions in the jurisprudence that prisons are not "choir schools" and that there is a heavy responsibility on prison administrators to have regard for the safety and security of prison guards and other personnel in an institution and, indeed, the prisoners themselves as well as the public. While, there may well be good reason for a 48-hour deadline for the filing of responses in some cases, the 48-hour provision should be treated, at most, as a guideline. What procedural fairness requires is that inmates be given a reasonable opportunity to file a meaningful response. In non-emergency situations, a few extra days may be involved. Where this cannot be accommodated, there is an obligation on the official refusing the extension request to give precise reasons as to why it cannot be accommodated. A general assertion about the risk to safety and security is insufficient.
