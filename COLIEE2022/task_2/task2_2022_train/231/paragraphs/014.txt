Section 13 of the
Transfer of Inmates
directive provides:
"The inmate shall be informed, in writing, that he or she has the right to respond to the proposed transfer, in writing, within 48 hours of the notification."
It was pursuant to this directive that the Acting Warden provided information to the applicants on September 8, 1992, and established a 48-hour period for them to file their responses. The Acting Warden explained his reasons for refusing to allow the extension to file responses requested by Ms. Pawliuk in the cross-examination of his affidavit:
"I can't recall specifically, but I believe the - I believe I indicated we thought these people were a real and present threat and it was an eminent threat; that it wasn't changed significantly by their being in segregation; that indeed it can, could be made even more dangerous or at least that is what my thoughts were at the time and that in, in numerous other cases of involuntary transfers - not numerous, we don't do very many involuntary transfers, but in other cases extensions have gone for I believe sometimes weeks or I think even months or more than a month. In this case I believe the danger was, was present. I believe it was imminent and I expressed - I had a high, high degree of concern for the security and safety of both the institution and the community in this regard. That's to the best of my recollection that phone call."
In insisting on the 48-hour deadline and refusing the extension of time request, I am of the opinion that the Acting Warden denied the applicants the opportunity to make effective responses. The result was that the respondent, when making his transfer decisions on September 10, 1992, had only the information supplied by the Acting Warden upon which to base those decisions.
