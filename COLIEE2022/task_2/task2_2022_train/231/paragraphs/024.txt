Counsel for the respondent argued that because the applicants had allowed the September 10, 1992 decisions to be made without making submissions, adherence to the rules of procedural fairness should not be strictly required with respect to the October 21, 1992 decisions. I have some doubt about the validity of this proposition generally but, in any event, I have found the September 10, 1992 decisions to be invalid. For the October 21, 1992 decisions to have cured the deficiency would require that at least they be made in accordance with minimum standards of procedural fairness.
