Procedural fairness required that Lee and Mathieson be given the right to a fair hearing in respect of their proposed involuntary transfer to Prince Albert. In respect of the September 10, 1992 decisions, they were given no hearing at all. The September 10, 1992 decisions were not made in compliance with requirements of procedural fairness and were therefore invalid.
