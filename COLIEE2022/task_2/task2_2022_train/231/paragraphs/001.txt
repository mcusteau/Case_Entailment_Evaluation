Rothstein, J.
: These are two applications for certiorari to quash decisions of the respondent transferring each of the applicants from Kent, a maximum security penitentiary, to the Special Housing Unit at the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at Prince Albert. A decision to transfer a prisoner to a penal institution where his freedom will be more severely restricted, as was the case here, is a committal to a "prison within a prison" which deprives the prisoner of his residual liberty. Such a decision must be made "in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice" under s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
(See
Gallant Correctional Service v. Canada (Pacific Region)
, [1989] 3 F.C. 329; 92 N.R. 292 at p. 337 F.C.). The issues in this case pertain to whether the transfer decisions were made in accordance with principles of natural justice or procedural fairness which are embraced in the broader concept of fundamental justice. (See Reference re s. 94(2)
