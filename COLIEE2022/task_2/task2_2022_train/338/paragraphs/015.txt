With respect to s. 7, in
Canada (Secretary of State) v. Luitjens
(1992), 142 N.R. 173 (F.C.A.), Mr. Justice Linden, in the context of a proceeding under s. 18 of the
Citizenship Act
such as this, wrote:
"I am of the view that s. 7 [of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
] does not render s. 18(3) of no force and effect. First,
at the time of the decision of the court, at least,
s. 7 was not engaged in that there was not yet any deprivation of Mr. Luitjens' 'life, liberty and security of the person'. All that was decided by the trial judge was the fact that Mr. Luitjens obtained his Canadian citizenship by false representations. This finding may well form the basis of decisions by others, which
may
interfere with those rights
at some future time
, but this decision does not do so. Therefore, it is merely one stage of a proceeding which may or may not result in a final revocation of citizenship and deportation or extradition."
