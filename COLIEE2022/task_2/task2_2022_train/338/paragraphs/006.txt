Counsel for the respondent argued: that the Notice of Reference was defective in that it provided insufficient particulars to enable the respondent to effectively know the case he had to meet and thus the duty of fairness owed to the respondent was breached; that the applicant had failed to prove that the respondent "knowingly" concealed circumstances material to his application for citizenship; that the failure to disclose absences was effectively irrelevant considering the amount of time that the respondent has been in Canada; and that the applicant had failed to specify the alleged periods of absence from Canada with sufficient particularity. Counsel further argued that the evidence adduced on behalf of the applicant failed to meet the burden of proof on her, or, put another way, that no prima facie case had been made out against the respondent and thus it was unnecessary for the respondent to testify and no negative inference should be drawn from the failure of the respondent to testify.
