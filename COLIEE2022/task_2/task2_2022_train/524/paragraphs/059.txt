[59]
Based on the evidence before the Court, I find the Defendants' dismissive attitude towards this proceeding and past judgments of this Court and the continued flagrant infringement of the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights to be worthy of rebuke. The conduct of the Defendants is reprehensible, scandalous and outrageous. Further, the public interest in this case justifies an award of solicitor-client costs. Accordingly, I find this Court should award solicitor-client costs.
