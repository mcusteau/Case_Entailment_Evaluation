As noted, Mr. Yang was not personally served with the Statement of Claim. Since he was served substitutionally, I must be satisfied, having regard to all of the circumstances, that it would be just to order default judgment (Rule 211,
Federal Courts Rules
). Mr. Yang's connection to both Ms. Lin and to K2 Fashions is evident from the affidavits filed in support of this motion. His role in the continuing sale of the Louis Vuitton counterfeit goods is apparent. It is, in my view, inconceivable that Mr. Yang is not aware of this action by the Plaintiffs. It would be just to order default judgment against Mr. Yang.
