Using the foregoing analysis, I project a profit of approximately $76,000 for the period commencing March 17, 2006. This, in my view, would be the minimum award to be awarded against the Defendants for their infringement of the trade-mark rights of the Plaintiffs. The true profit is almost certainly higher, although how much higher is almost impossible to assess.
