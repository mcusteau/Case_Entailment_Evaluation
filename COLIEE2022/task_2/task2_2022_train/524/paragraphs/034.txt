The Plaintiffs have presented affidavit evidence which, in their opinion, provides a strong evidentiary basis for the Court to find that the Defendants' profits have been at least $60,000 to $90,000 per year since December 2003. Thus, they submit that the total profits are in the range of $240,000 to $360,000 for the four-year period. The totals are calculated by determining an approximate average profit for the two batches of inventory delivered up (roughly $15,000) and assuming that this amount would be realized in profits at least four - and up to six - times per year.
