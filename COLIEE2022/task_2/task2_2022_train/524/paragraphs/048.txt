Justice Binnie also developed general principles in
Whiten
relating to punitive damages. Having regard to the factors cited in the jurisprudence, I find the following facts indicate that that the Defendants have acted in a "malicious, oppressive and high-handed" manner in the case at bar and that punitive damages should therefore be awarded:
• The Defendants have been aware since December 2001, when an Anton Piller Order was executed against them, that their sale of counterfeit LV products was in violation of the Plaintiff's intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, they have persisted in selling infringing products;
• In spite of two previous judgments, the first on April 26, 2002, the second on June 8, 2004, the infringing activities have continued;
• The monetary awards contained in the April 26, 2002 and the June 8, 2004 judgments have not been paid;
• The Defendants have been advised numerous times to stop the sale of products infringing on the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights since the June 8, 2004, judgment, but have nevertheless persisted in their infringing activity;
• The Defendants have attempted to conceal and cover-up their actions by placing the counterfeit products in hidden displays and drawers; and
• As discussed above, the Plaintiffs are unable, due to the actions of the Defendants in failing to defend their actions, to provide the evidence necessary to establish adequate compensatory damages.
