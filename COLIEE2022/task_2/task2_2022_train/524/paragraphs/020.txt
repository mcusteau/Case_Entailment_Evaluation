Courts, including this Court, have had some opportunity to establish an appropriate level of statutory damages. I have had regard to this jurisprudence (see, for example,
L.S. Entertainment Group Inc. v. Formosa Video (Canada) Ltd
., 2005 FC 1347;
Wing v. Van Velthuizen
(2000), 9 C.P.R. (4th) 449 (F.C.T.D.);
Ritchie v. Sawmill Creek Golf & Country Club Ltd.,
[2003] O.J. No. 3144 (S.C.J.);
Telewizja Polsat S.A. v. Radiopol Inc
., 2006 FC 584).
