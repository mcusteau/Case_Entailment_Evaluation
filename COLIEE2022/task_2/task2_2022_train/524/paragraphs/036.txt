I can agree with the sales calculations for each of the occasions when counterfeit goods were delivered up. The Plaintiffs have put forward evidence as to the value of the LV goods that were delivered up on March 17, 2006. The total sale price of the items with price tags was $10,664. I accept these numbers. I also accept that, adding in conservative approximate values to the goods without price tags, the total sale value of the 130 counterfeit items delivered up on March 17, 2006 would have been approximately $14,000. The Plaintiffs carried out similar calculations for the 193 saleable items delivered up on March 12, 2007. I am satisfied that a reasonable total sale value for the items seized on March 12, 2007 would have been approximately $14,970 or $23,000 adding in conservative approximate values without price tags.
