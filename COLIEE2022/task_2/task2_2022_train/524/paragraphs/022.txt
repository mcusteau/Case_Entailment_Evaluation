A review of all the relevant facts in this case, in light of the jurisprudence referred to above, leads me to a conclusion that the maximum statutory award of $20,000 for each of the discrete acts of infringement of the Copyrighted Works is appropriate. In this case, there are many factors that justify the maximum allowable award.
