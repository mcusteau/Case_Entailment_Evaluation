The first problem is the calculations begin before the date of the last judgment of this Court. On June 8, 2004, this Court granted judgment to the Plaintiffs and awarded injunctive relief and damages in respect of the infringements up to that date. Admittedly, the Defendants have ignored the Order, have continued to infringe and have failed to pay the amounts awarded. The Plaintiffs may have had recourse to the Court to enforce the earlier judgment. However, failure to comply with earlier injunctions and awards of damages does not permit the Plaintiffs to bring forward amounts of alleged profits from before the earlier judgment. On the other hand, the Defendants' conduct is certainly something to consider in assessing the appropriateness of punitive damages; that is considered later in these reasons. The evidence before me in this action can only establish that the infringing activities commenced on March 17, 2006; an accounting of profits can only begin from that date. The period of infringement is, therefore, approximately 18 months or 1.5 years. Based on the Plaintiffs' calculations on an annual basis, that would reduce the total profits claimed to a range of $90,000 to $135,000.
