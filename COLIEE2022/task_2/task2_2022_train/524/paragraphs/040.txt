The next difficulty that I have with the Plaintiffs' submissions is their assumption that the Defendants turn over their stock of counterfeit LV inventory at least four to six times per year. I have carefully reviewed the affidavits on this point and cannot identify any evidence that would support such a statement. While I am prepared to assume that the goods seized or delivered up would, at some point, have been sold, I am not persuaded that I ought to make an assumption that the same volume of counterfeit goods would be sold some four to six times per year.
