The second aspect of damages would be the sales that the Defendants have made that would have been made by the Plaintiffs. Given the nature of this counterfeit business, it is simply not reasonable to assume that someone who buys an LV "knock-off" from K2 Fashions would otherwise have bought a product with the genuine LV Trade-mark. I would think it reasonable to assume that a person buying one the counterfeit LV products would be motivated almost exclusively by price and would not likely pay the full price of the genuine article.
