As submitted by the Plaintiffs, the Court has, as an alternative, applied a "nominal" award per infringing activity. In this case, that calculation would result in an award of $72,000 (at $6000 per infringing activity for each Plaintiff). The $6000 was first set in 1997 to represent a fair approximation of damages (
Nike Canada Ltd. v. Goldstar Design Ltd. et al.
, T-1951-95 (F.C.T.D.)). The Plaintiffs have presented evidence to demonstrate that the $6000 scale amount, when adjusted for inflation, would now be approximately $7250. I agree with their calculations of the inflation adjustment. Accordingly, on the basis of a "nominal" award, I would assess the damages as $87,000.
