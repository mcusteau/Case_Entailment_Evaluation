I agree with the Registrar that the proposed trademark Orchard Blends is not
clearly
descriptive of the applicant's associated wares. At best it is suggestive (See e.g.
G.W.G. Ltd. v. Registrar of Trademarks
(1981), 55 C.P.R.(2d), 1 at p. 67 (F.C.T.D.)) of fruit juices, but no more than that. In this respect I agree with the position taken by the applicant and reject the efforts of the opponent to have the Registrar reversed on this point.
