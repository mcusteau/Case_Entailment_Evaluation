I have concluded, however, that the hearing Member was correct in his conclusions that the register evidence in this case is not by itself sufficient to show that the state of the marketplace was such in August 1985 that the introduction of another Orchard trademark would not cause confusion with the opponent's trademark. I believe the
Park Avenue
and
Kellogg
cases are distinguishable. In
Park Avenue
I take it there was other evidence of use by the registered trademark owners: Desjardins, J.A., states that these marks "were shown on the evidence to have been used by such owners ..." (Ibid, at 428 C.P.R.). In
Kellogg
there were not nine (as in the present case) but over ninety registered trademarks using Nutri, the word in question, at the relevant time. The court also found that there was evidence that Nutri "has been generally adopted and used in the food trade in Canada" (Supra note 3 at 12) [para. 14 of N.R. report]. In my view there was insufficient evidence before the member or before me to demonstrate such use of Orchard in the food trade as in the words of Desjardins, J.A., in
Park Avenue
, to render that word "open to the trade to use". In this I see no reason to depart from the Member's conclusions on the facts.
