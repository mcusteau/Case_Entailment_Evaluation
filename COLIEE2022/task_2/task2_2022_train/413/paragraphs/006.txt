With respect to confusion I agree with the Registrar that the applicant has not met the burden of proof on it to demonstrate that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion. In this respect I believe the Registrar has correctly assessed the various criteria specified in s. 6(5) of the
Act
and I think that the additional evidence filed before me does not justify a different result.
