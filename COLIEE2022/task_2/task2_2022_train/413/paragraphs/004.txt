I am entitled to determine whether the Registrar was wrong, but I must also have regard to the knowledge and expertise of the Registrar
in reaching the decision he did. (
Mcdonald Corp. v. Silcorp Ltd.
(1992), 139 N.R. 319; 41 C.P.R.(3d) 67, at p. 68 (F.C.A.).) This is particularly important where no new significant evidence has been produced before the court on appeal. In this case I do not think that anything seriously bringing into question the decision of the Registrar has been filed on appeal. Considering all the circumstances and the new evidence, I am not satisfied that the Registrar was wrong in reaching the conclusions he did.
