  Ms. Kaur Gill submitted her evidence to the IAD beginning in early 2011, well after the existing version of section 4 came into force. It does not appear that she made any written submissions to the IAD. However, she had an opportunity to make oral submissions during the IAD's hearings on March 18, 2011, at which the Respondent raised the change in the wording of section 4 as a potential issue, and on October 25, 2011.
