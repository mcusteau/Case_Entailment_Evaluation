  With respect to Mr. Gill's immigration history, the IAD noted that he first arrived in Canada in 2000 on a false passport. It observed that he then made an unsuccessful claim for refugee protection. It declined to draw a negative inference from this fact, because it did not have evidence regarding the basis for the rejection of that claim. It then turned to his first marriage, which occurred in May 2003. In this regard, it noted that there was little, if any, vetting of compatibility between Mr. Gill and his first wife; and that Mr. Gill's explanation for this was that her family was located in Canada. The IAD observed that this explanation was not credible, because there was no evidence which supported the proposition that marrying in Canada made background checks impractical, unnecessary or onerous. It added that Mr. Gill provided no plausible explanation for why such background checks were not conducted. It found that this was significant, because (i) such background checks would have turned up the fact that his first wife was illiterate, (ii) he testified that Ms. Kaur Gill's high level of education was an important consideration for him and his family at the time he was courting her, and (iii) the evidence did not establish that the importance of finding a well educated bride changed over time, for him and his family, between the time he married his first wife and the time he married Ms. Kaur Gill. In addition, the IAD noted that background checks may well have disclosed the fact that his first wife was still married at the time of his marriage to her. It then observed that, rather than waiting for her divorce, so that he could legally marry her, he separated from her, apparently, because she could no longer sponsor him. Later on in its decision, the IAD observed that the evidence suggested that his first marriage "was likely motivated by his desire to gain admission to Canada."
