  I disagree. A plain reading of section 4 of the Regulations reflects that these are two distinct tests. If a finding that a marriage is genuine precluded the possibility of a finding that the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, the latter test would be superfluous. This would offend the presumption against statutory surplusage. (
