The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board is an administrative tribunal that has specialized knowledge of immigration and refugee protection matters. The members of the Refugee Protection Division are appointed by the Governor in Council (paragraph 153(1)(a) of the
Act
). They need not be career civil servants and do not necessarily have extensive expertise or knowledge. The Board, however, does have institutional expertise, since it is a specialized tribunal that deals with immigration and refugee protection matters every day.
