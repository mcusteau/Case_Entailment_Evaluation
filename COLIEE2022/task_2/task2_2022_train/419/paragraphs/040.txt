The contentious issue in this case is whether, under the circumstances, the applicants can be deemed Convention refugees under section 96 of the
Act
, which sets out specific persecution grounds, namely race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group and political opinion. The Refugee Protection Division is to examine the facts in the record and determine whether, in law, claimants have been persecuted on one of the grounds. Determining whether there is a nexus between the facts in the record and the persecution grounds described in section 96 of the
Act
clearly involves questions of mixed fact and law.
