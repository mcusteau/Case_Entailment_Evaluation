In my view, the Board's decision to exclude the male applicant from application of the Convention cannot be upheld because it found he lacked credibility. The burden, however, is on the Crown to establish that there are "serious reasons for considering" that the male applicant committed acts described in section 1F. In this case, the Board seems to have concluded that the male applicant should be excluded because he did not provide convincing evidence that he did not commit these acts. This burden is not on the male applicant. The Board's reasoning on this matter is erroneous and warrants the intervention of this Court, since it erred in law.
