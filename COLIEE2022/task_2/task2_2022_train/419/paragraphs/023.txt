The evidence must show that there are serious reasons for considering that the male applicant committed crimes against humanity. The Board did not address this issue. It did not establish which war crimes the male applicant allegedly committed. It simply referred to war crimes in broad terms and found that the Peruvian army frequently uses torture and commits acts of violence against civilians in areas where Tupac Amaru and Shining Path rebels are found. Since it ruled that the male applicant's testimony was not credible, the Board concluded that, because he was a member of the Peruvian army, he was responsible for these crimes. In my view, these reasons are not sufficient to establish that the male applicant committed crimes against humanity.
