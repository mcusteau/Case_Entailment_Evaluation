In this case, the male applicant's fear is based on the fear of being persecuted by two soldiers involved in drug trafficking, which the male applicant reported. Since the female applicant's allegation that high-ranked individuals were involved and used their official positions to persecute the applicants has not been established by the evidence, I feel it was reasonable for the Board to find that there was no nexus between the applicants' fear and the Convention grounds. As stated by the respondent, victims of criminal acts are not a social group under the Convention:
