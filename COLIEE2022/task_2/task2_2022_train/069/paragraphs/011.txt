  More insidious, is a letter of 14 May 2003 from the Kitasoo Band Council, signed by Percy Starr, who styles himself as Chief Councillor/Band Manager, and also swears affidavit material in this action as "Chief of the Kitasoo Band Council, Hereditary Chief of the Kitasoo-Xaixais Band and Member of the Order of Canada". The effect of the 14 May 2003 letter is to order a termination of her employment with an entity called Co-Management. Here we have a decision going beyond mere harassment, a decision which cuts away the income of Ms. Edgar, a step taken without her being able to have any input or to address the decision-maker, a point made by Mr. Justice Lemieux in his reasons staying the initial banishment Resolution. The letters certainly broaden the scope of the judicial review beyond that as characterize by counsel for the respondents: indeed, both letters can be read in terms of ongoing harassment and in breach of the sort of fairness referred to by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Nicholson v. Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Board of Commissioners of Police and Ontario (Attorney General) 
 , [1979] 1 S.C.R. 311; 23 N.R. 410 and  
 Martineau v. Matsqui Institution Disciplinary Board 
 , [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602; 30 N.R. 119, cases relied upon by Mr. Justice Lemieux.
