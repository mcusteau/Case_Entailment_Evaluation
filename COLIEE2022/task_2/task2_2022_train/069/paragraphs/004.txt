  The standard to apply, in determining whether a judicial review proceeding ought to be converted into an action pursuant to Rule 18.4(2) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 , is whether evidence by affidavit will be inadequate, not that viva voce evidence at trial might be superior, and even then the conversion should only be allowed in the clearest of circumstances: see  
 MacInnis v. Canada (Attorney General) et al. 
  (1994), 166 N.R. 57 (F.C.A.), at 60. The Court of Appeal in  
 MacInnis 
  set out various elements which might and might not meet this standard, but made the observation that: 
 
 
 
 "It is, in general, only where facts of whatever nature cannot be satisfactorily established or weighed through affidavit evidence that consideration should be given to using s. 18.4(2) of the  
 Act 
 . (loc. cit.)" 
 
 
 
 The Court of Appeal also observed that a conversion might occur "... where there is a need for viva voce evidence, either to assess demeanour and credibility of witnesses or to allow the Court to have a full grasp of the whole of the evidence whenever it feels the case cries out for the full panoply of a trial ..." (loc. cit.) What I take from  
 MacInnis 
  is that if sufficient facts to enable the Court to decide the issue or issues can be generated by affidavit evidence, the conversion ought not to occur. In the present instance Mr. Justice Lemieux seemed to easily find sufficient facts to enable him to issue strongly worded reasons arising out of the successful application for an interlocutory injunction staying the impugned Band Council Resolution.
