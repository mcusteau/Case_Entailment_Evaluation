 Hargrave, Prothonotary 
 : This judicial review application, commenced 23 December 2002 and which has now proceeded as far as the serving and filing of affidavits, involves the challenge of an in-camera Band Council Resolution of 21 November 2002 ("Resolution"). That Resolution banned the applicant from the central coast British Columbia Community of Klemtu, by reason of an as yet unproven charge involving $20 worth of marihuana. The applicant wishes to convert the application to an action pursuant to s. 18.4(2) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 .
