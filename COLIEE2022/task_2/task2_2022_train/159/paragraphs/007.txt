  The evidence tendered by the Defendant in support of its first argument is unconvincing. It rests solely on hearsay statements and appears contradicted by such documentary evidence as has been adduced so far by the Plaintiff. The Defendant has not succeeded in establishing that there exists an agreement between the parties superseding the written terms and conditions of the agreement.
