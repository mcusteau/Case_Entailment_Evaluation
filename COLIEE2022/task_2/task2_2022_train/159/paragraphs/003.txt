  It is trite law that the general rule which governs the amount of bail to be provided in order to obtain the release of a ship or prevent its arrest is that bail must be sufficient to cover the Plaintiff's reasonably arguable best case, including interest and costs, but limited by the value of the arrested vessel. Here, the value of the vessel that might be arrested does not come into play, being vastly superior to the claim asserted by the Plaintiff.
