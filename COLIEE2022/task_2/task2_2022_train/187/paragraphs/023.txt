  The Court observes, for instance, that the Officer noticed that the letters at pages 72, 73 and 74 of the Tribunal Record have the same font. He also noticed that the business cards make reference to a @yahoo.com and a @gmail.com email addresses, but not to a corporate email. Two (2) letters from two (2) different employers are signed on the same day, using the same type of paper with both letterheads printed in poor quality ink-jet and are otherwise quite alike (Tribunal Record, pp 72 and 73). The Officer further noticed that the duties enumerated in the letter from Cirico are nearly copied from the NOC. The applicant's comparative table between the NOC and the reference letters submitted to the Court failed to convince this Court (Applicant's Reply, para 6). Furthermore, the Officer noted that it would be unlikely for a company to hire the applicant for a position (Construction Project Manager) for which he had no apparent previous experience (Tribunal Record, p 8). Thus, on the basis of this information, the Court is of the opinion that the Officer's decision was reasonable.
