 [9] 
  Given the lack of satisfactory evidence concerning the applicant's work experience under the NOC code 0711 and NOC code 0111, the application was deemed ineligible for processing and was refused. The letter sent to the applicant, dated March 14, 2012, informed the applicant that he had "not provided sufficient evidence that [he] performed the actions described in the lead statement for those occupations" (Tribunal Record, p 9). The applicant requested reconsideration of the refusal decision on March 23, 2012. Attached to this request was a more detailed letter of employment from Cirico (Applicant's Record, Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibits H and I, pp 37-43). The applicant having received no response to his request for reconsideration, a reminder was sent via email by his counsel on April 3, 2012, which has also allegedly remained unanswered (Applicant's Record, Applicant's Affidavit, Exhibit J, p 46). The applicant therefore filed this application for judicial review.
