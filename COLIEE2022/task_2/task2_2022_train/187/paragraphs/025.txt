  As explained earlier, the burden of providing sufficient information rests on the applicant, and where the Officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the Act or its Regulations, there is no duty on the Officer to raise doubts or concerns with the applicant ( 
 Kaur v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 442 at para 11, [2010] FCJ No 587 (QL) [ 
 Kaur 
 ];  
 Hassani 
 , above, at para 24). Also, and contrary to the applicant's submission, there is no such absolute duty on the Officer where the application, on its face, is void of credibility. In terms of sufficient information, the onus will not shift on the Officer simply on the basis that the application is "complete". The applicant has the burden to put together an application that is not only "complete" but relevant, convincing and unambiguous ( 
 Singh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  2012 FC 526, [2012] FCJ No 548;  
 Kamchibekov 
 , above, at para 26). Despite the distinction that the applicant attempts to make between sufficiency and authenticity, the fact of the matter is that a complete application is in fact insufficient if the information it includes is irrelevant, unconvincing or ambiguous.
