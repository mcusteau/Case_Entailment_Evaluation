  The applicant in this case agrees that an Officer is under no obligation to allow a given applicant to make further submissions if the concern is one that arises from the legislation or regulation. However, the applicant submits that his application was complete as it included the information required. As such, the applicant contends that he complied with the legislation and regulation and provided  
 sufficient 
  information. As indicated above, the applicant alleges that this case is not one that raises an issue of  
 sufficiency 
  of information - where no duty is owed by the Officer - but of  
 authenticity 
  of information. On the basis of this distinction, the applicant relies strongly on paragraph 24 in  
 Hassani 
 , and asserts that the Officer had a duty to provide him with an opportunity to address his concerns regarding the authenticity of the documents provided in support of his application. Justice Mosley in  
 Hassani 
 , above, at paragraph 24, observed the following: 
 
 
 
 [24] Having reviewed the factual context of the cases cited above, it is clear that where a concern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns.  
 Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise. This is often the case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer's concern 
 , as was the case in  
 Rukmangathan 
 , and in  
 John 
  and  
 Cornea 
  cited by the Court in  
 Rukmangathan 
 , above. [Emphasis added.]
