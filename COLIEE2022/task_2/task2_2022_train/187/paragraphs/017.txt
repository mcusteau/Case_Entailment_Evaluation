  More particularly, the applicant submits that the Officer should have provided him with a meaningful opportunity to respond to his concerns, and by failing to do so, the Officer committed a breach of procedural fairness ( 
 Li v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 1284, 337 FTR 100;  
 Rahim v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 1252 at para 12, 152 ACWS (3d) 501). In this regard, the applicant relies on  
 Torres v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 818 at para 38, 2 ImmLR (4th) 57 [ 
 Torres 
 ], to argue that "where credibility, accuracy or the genuine nature of information is in question, a duty also exists to give an opportunity to an applicant to disabuse an officer of any concerns that may arise" (also relying on  
 Hassani v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 1283, [2007] 3 FCR 501 [ 
 Hassani 
 ]). The applicant submits that his application was complete and that the issue is accordingly not one of sufficiency, but rather of authenticity, of the documents provided in support of his application. In the applicant's view, it follows that the Officer owed him a duty of fairness.
