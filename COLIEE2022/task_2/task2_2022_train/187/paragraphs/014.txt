  The issue of whether or not the Officer should have brought his concerns to the attention of the applicant and offered him an opportunity to address them is a question of procedural fairness, and is reviewable on a standard of correctness. However, the Officer's concerns themselves, namely his assessment of the evidence and subsequent conclusion that the application was ineligible for processing, are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness ( 
 Kamchibekov v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 1411 at para 12, [2011] FCJ No 1782 (QL) [ 
 Kamchibekov 
 ]). Deference being owed to the Officer in his assessment of the evidence, the Court will only interfere with the Officer's conclusions if they do not fall "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir v New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9 at para 47, [2008] 1 SCR 190 [ 
 Dunsmuir 
 ]).
