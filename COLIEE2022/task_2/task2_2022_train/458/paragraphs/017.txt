In my view, it would be an unusual case in which counsel or a representative would be denied disclosure of confidential information. Some special reason would have to be apparent that would lead to such an extraordinary result. In the ordinary case, unauthorized disclosure should be addressed by the conditions under which counsel or representative receives the confidential information, such as the duty not to copy it or perhaps the requirement to use it only at specified locations.
