In this case, the Appeal Board, in its decision, ignored this role of counsel or representative by limiting disclosure only to a person who could give evidence before the tribunal. In making such a ruling, the Appeal Board erred by denying the applicants the right to have their representative, who was in charge of managing and conducting their case, know the same information that would be known by his potential witness. While the Appeal Board's concern with confidentiality was appropriate, it was an error for the Appeal Board to limit disclosure in the manner it did.
