 [22] 
  The applicant proposed the following serious question of general importance for my consideration for certification: 
 
 
 
 Can a mandatory employment requirement under the National Occupational Classification be fulfilled by a method other than what is listed therein? 
 
 
 
 I am not prepared to certify this question as I do not believe that it is a serious question of general importance that is determinative of this application. I would note that similar questions have been rejected for certification by this Court.
