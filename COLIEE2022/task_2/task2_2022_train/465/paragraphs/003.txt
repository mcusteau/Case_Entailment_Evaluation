The Officer stated at paragraph 10 of her affidavit:
"I considered all of the information provided to me and I believe that I was alert, alive and attentive to the best interests of the children in making my determination. The children ... were 15 and 14 respectively at the time of the interview. I considered that they had been in Canada since December 1991, almost 9 years. I considered that they had gone to school while in Canada and that the children would have to make some real adjustments to living outside Canada but I did not see any evidence that they would not be able to manage the adjustment. The Applicants asserted they did not want their children to have the life that they did but there was no evidence before me that the children would be at risk. The parents concern that they would have to go live in a small village was not reason enough to warrant special consideration."
