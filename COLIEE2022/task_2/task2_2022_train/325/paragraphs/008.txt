Personally, I am proud to have served my country as Minister of Veterans Affairs and Minister of Public Works a quarter of a century ago. In 1975 I was appointed to the Federal Court and took an oath of office to be fair and impartial. For the past twenty-four years I have dealt with trials, appeals, motions and judicial reviews in all ten provinces of Canada, quite often involving the government. Never have I been asked to recuse myself.
