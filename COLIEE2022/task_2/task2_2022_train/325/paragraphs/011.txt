As I mentioned at the end of the hearing of this motion for recusal, I am not seized with the main application for judicial review nor with any of the other motions pending in this matter. The two days set aside in the Vancouver rota for this matter have now been spent. The Associate Chief Justice is free to assign this matter to any judge, including myself, sitting on the Vancouver rota or elsewhere.
