  The Applicant and Hammad Hamit decided to marry on July 19, 2006, two years after they began their romantic relationship. It is a first marriage for both of them. According to the Applicant and Hammad Hamid, the decision to marry was precipitated by the negative decision of his PRRA. The Applicant and her husband realized the only way to ensure their future together was to get married so the Applicant would be able to sponsor Hammad Hamid to return to Canada from Pakistan. Due to their personal circumstances, the Applicant and Hammad Hamid had not been living together full time at the time and were thus not eligible to file a sponsorship application as common law partners.
