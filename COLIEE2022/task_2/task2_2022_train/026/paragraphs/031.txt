  By way of example, the Board ignored documentary evidence which supports the genuineness of both the marriage and Hammad Hamid's intentions to a certain extent, including many photographs of the Applicant and Hammad Hamid together in Canada; various greeting cards exchanged during the relationship covering the period following Mr. Hammid's return to Pakistan; evidence of the couple's telephone communications between 2004 and 2008; evidence of the couple's e-mail correspondence and the solemn affirmations signed by friends and family of the couple including the Applicant's sister. While the Board is presumed to have considered all of the evidence, the presumption is rebutted where the Board fails to mention relevant evidence such as this, which contradicts its findings. As noted above, there was an obligation for the Board to explain why it did not accept that evidence.
