On judicial review, as is well known, the court does not substitute its decision for that made by the tribunal that is under review. It is trite law that one must find that the decision was based on an error of law or on an erroneous finding of fact
made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the Board
; see, for example,
Lalonde v. Canada (Veterans Appeal Board)
June 21, 1995, T-224-94 (F.C.T.D.). Also, in
Johnston v. Canada (Minister of Veterans Affairs)
(1990), 108 N.R. 306 (F.C.A.), it was noted that the weight to be given to evidence must be left to the Board. See also
Tonner v. Canada
(1995), 94 F.T.R. 146 (T.D.).
