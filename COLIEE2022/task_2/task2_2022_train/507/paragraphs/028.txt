On reflection, I have decided that even if the applicant's interpretation of the Board's statements concerning a lack of x-ray documentation is correct, it would not assist the applicant, in the end, because he still has not proven causation. If the Board's reference is to the 1995-1996 diagnosis, then, it relates to the extent of the applicant's present disability and that prognosis. It does not relate to the linkage between his present disability and events occurring during his military service. It is the inability to prove this linkage that is the main reason for the Board's refusal to grant the applicant a disability pension.
