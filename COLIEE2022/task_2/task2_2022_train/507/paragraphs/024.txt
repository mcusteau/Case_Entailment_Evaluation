I cannot conclude that the Board's weighing of the evidence ignored any of the directions set out in s. 39 and the jurisprudence. In the mouths of the doctors the statement that the injury was "assumed" to relate to the 1983-1984 event; or that the doctor "feels" it is "probably" the result of the 1984 injury, is speculation. Neither doctor had any first hand knowledge of the events; they were not treating the applicant in 1983-1984, and had not even been doing so at the commencement of his complaints in 1987-1988. Neither doctor in 1996 had any basis other than the applicant's recitation of events on which to base a conclusion as to the event that caused the injury. And, as noted, the applicant's description of the 1983-1984 event as constituting a cause of injury is contradicted by documentary evidence, signed by him in 1984.
