One aspect of the decision, however, that does give rise to some uncertainty is the assertion by the Board that: "this Board maintains that Dr. Lovell's opinion is not supported by x-ray documentation ...". While the applicant appears not to have attempted to file the 1987-1988 x-rays, he states that the x-rays from 1992 were filed by Dr. Pietrangelo and were subsequently returned to him. Also the applicant asserts that Dr. Lovell took x-rays in 1996 as part of his diagnostic procedure. Dr. Lovell makes reference to x-rays in his report to the Board.
