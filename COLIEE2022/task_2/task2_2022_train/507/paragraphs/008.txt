The applicant's physician, Dr. R. Lovell, had new x-rays taken in 1996. He prepared a statement on January 24, 1996, and a written report dated December 10, 1996. The latter reads as follows:
"Mr. Hall has asked me to write a letter on his behalf with respect to ongoing problems from a neck injury that he sustained in 1984 while in the Armed Forces.
He states
that he went on manoeuvers [sic] carrying a rather heavy backpack when he fell through a surface into a crevice [sic] forcing his neck forward.
He states
that it took sometime [sic] for three of his fellow soldiers to extract him from this crevice [sic]. Immediately following his accident he had minor neck complaints that cleared up and did not really start to bother him until approximately one year later. Since that time he has been complaining of neck pain that over time requires a visit to the chiropractor approximately every two weeks to relieve this pain. He has no family history of arthritis, nor any evidence of arthritis elsewhere.
"
Cervical spine x-ray
showed osteophyte formation at C4-5 and C6 with the rest of the x-ray being reported as normal.
These signs of arthritis
of the cervical spine which in the absence of any other sign of arthritis elsewhere
would lead one to think that this is a condition brought on by his accident since he denies any other injuries to his neck
.
"In summary,
I fell Mr. Hall suffers from mild arthritis to the cervical spine probably as a result of his neck injury in 1984
." (underlining added)
