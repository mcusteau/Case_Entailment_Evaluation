The entitlement review panel of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, in its decision of January 22, 1997, concluded as follows:
"The Review Panel noted there is no medical record of an injury to the applicant during his Reserve Force service. Furthermore, there is no record of the extent of such an injury indicating possible future consequences. The applicant sought medical help for the condition some four year [sic] following the injury and it wasn't until January 1996 that the diagnosis is made by a medical doctor some twelve years following the reported injury.
. . . . .
"The Panel considered all of the medical evidence and opinions presented to it, along with the detailed statement submitted by the applicant. In conclusion,
the Panel has no medical advice or opinion of the occurrence or extent of an injury to the applicant during the winter exercise in 1983/1984. The fact that his seeking medical attention in 1987-1988 suggest that the disability is post-discharge in origin and not related to his Reserve Force service
