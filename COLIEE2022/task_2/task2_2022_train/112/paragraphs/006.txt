  The applicant provided documentary evidence about the scale and nature of official corruption, and the attendant violence, that represent serious social and human rights problems in Mexico. He claimed that municipal government is effectively run by officials of the national government, and that the influence of the governing party, the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (the PRI) was pervasive throughout governmental bodies in Mexico. Thus, while the taxi industry in Mexico City is formally run by municipal officials, they are subject to direction from officials at the national level. As a stark indication of the violence that is endemic in the taxi industry, the applicant stated in his personal information form that in May 1996 35 taxi drivers were murdered in Mexico City, 20 of whom worked from the same base as the applicant.
