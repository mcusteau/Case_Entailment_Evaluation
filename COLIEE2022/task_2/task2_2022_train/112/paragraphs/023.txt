  The applicant also attacked the Board's finding that it would not be unduly harsh to expect the applicant to relocate himself and his family in another part of Mexico. Counsel for the Minister forcefully drew to my attention cases in which it had been held that it is not unreasonable to require a person to live in a part of her country of citizenship where she has no friends or family, the climate might be less favourable, or a different type of employment would have to be sought: see, for example,  
 Thirunavukkarasu v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1993), 163 N.R. 232 (F.C.A.), at pp. 236-237. But I did not understand counsel to maintain that it would be reasonable for a person to be required to return to a country, despite the serious adverse effect that this would have upon the person's psychological well-being, such as the persistence of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Rather, the dispute was whether on the totality of the evidence adduced in this case the Refugee Division had made an erroneous finding of fact "without regard for the material before it".
