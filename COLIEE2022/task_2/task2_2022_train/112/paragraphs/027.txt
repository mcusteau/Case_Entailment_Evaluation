  Finally, I must consider whether the Refugee Division made this erroneous finding of fact "without regard for the material before it". In my view, the evidence was so important to the applicant's case that it can be inferred from the Refugee Division's failure to mention it in its reasons that the finding of fact was made without regard to it. This inference is made easier to draw because the Board's reasons dealt with other items of evidence indicating that a return would not be unduly harsh. The inclusion of the "boilerplate" assertion that the Board considered all the evidence before it is not sufficient to prevent this inference from being drawn, given the importance of the evidence to the applicant's claim.
