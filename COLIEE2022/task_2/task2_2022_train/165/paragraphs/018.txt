  The RPD also drew negative inferences as it seemingly misunderstood the difference between a heart attack and a stroke. The applicant had written in his BOC that his father had suffered a stroke, and had produced a medical report indicating that his father had suffered from facial paralysis in late November 2012, and was advised to seek bed rest for five days. Yet the RPD could not accept that a man suffering from a heart condition would be issued such a medical report. Moreover, the applicant had testified that his father became bedridden, almost paralyzed, and required assistance to complete basic life tasks; yet the medical note does not mention a bedridden person, but rather someone who suffers from facial paralysis and who has to stay in bed for a five-day period.
