 [42] 
  Therefore, I am of the view that both the RAD's interpretation of subsection 110(4) of the Act (as a question of law that is not of general importance to the legal system as a whole and outside the expertise of the RAD) and its application to the facts of this case (as a question of mixed fact and law) are to be reviewed on the reasonableness standard.
