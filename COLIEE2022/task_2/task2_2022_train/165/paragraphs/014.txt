  The applicant claimed to have arrived with some genuine documents, including his birth certificate, a 1998 school report card, as well as two school diplomas (a grade 10 diploma from 2000, and a grade 12 diploma from 2002). The RPD found it noteworthy to add that neither diploma had been examined by the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA]. However, only the grade 10 diploma was before the RPD. In addition to not confirming his identity, the fact that the 2002 diploma was missing could not corroborate that the applicant had studied with Bhupinder Singh until 2002.
