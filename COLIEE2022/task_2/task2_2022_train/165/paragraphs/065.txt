 [65] 
  As indicated above, I am of the view that said question is not determinative of the present case and that it would not be determinative of an appeal. However, I view the following questions as being of general importance and determinative in the case at bar: 
 
 
 
 • What standard of review should be applied by this Court when reviewing the Refugee Appeal Division's interpretation of subsection 110(4) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27? 
 
 
 
 • In considering the role of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment officer and that of the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, sitting in appeal of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division, does the test set out in  
 Raza v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FCA 385 for the interpretation of paragraph 113( 
 a 
 ) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, 
  SC 2001, c 27 apply to its subsection 110(4)?
