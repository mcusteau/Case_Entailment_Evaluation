 : This application for judicial review concerns the power and duties of the newly constituted Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [RAD], not so much with respect to the standard of intervention that it should apply when sitting in appeal of decisions by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD], but rather with respect to the criteria it must consider upon admitting evidence not before the RPD.
