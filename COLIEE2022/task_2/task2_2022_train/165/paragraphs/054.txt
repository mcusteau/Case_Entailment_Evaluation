  Further, a restrictive interpretation of this new section would limit the ability of a claimant to get a "full fact-based appeal," as former Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Jason Kenney intended. I quote his remarks in Hansard (41st Parliament, 1st Session, Tuesday March 6, 2012): 
 
 
 
 "I reiterate that the bill would also create the new refugee appeal division. The vast majority of claimants who are coming from countries that do normally produce refugees would for the first time, if rejected at the refugee protection division, have  
 access to a full fact-based appeal at the refugee appeal division of the IRB 
 . This is the first government to have created a full fact-based appeal." [Emphasis added.]
