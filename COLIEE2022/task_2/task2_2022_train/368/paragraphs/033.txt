The submission that failure to disclose to the applicant, in advance of the officer's decision, the criteria employed under the SVP assessment constitutes a reviewable error is essentially the matter dealt with in
Yu (W.) v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
. [see footnote 14] In finding that there was no breach of procedural fairness in that case, I held that
"... there is no ground for arguing unfairness in the process merely because the visa officer at an interview of the applicant does not stress all of the concerns he may have that arise directly from the
Act
and
Regulations
that he is bound to follow in his assessment of an application. The
Act
and
Regulations
pertinent to admission are available to applicants whose task is to establish to the satisfaction of the visa officer that they meet the criteria set out and that their admission to Canada would not be contrary to the
Act
."
