As for s. 11(1) of the
Regulations
, the applicant submits that this provision requires the officer to consider whether the applicant is able to carry out the proposed job, notwithstanding alleged lack of experience. It is said the visa officer, in basing her decision in part on the applicant's lack of bookkeeping experience failed to apply this provision and, therefore, erred. The relevant parts of the subsection read as follows:
"11(1) Subject to subss. (3) and (5), a visa officer shall not issue an immigrant visa pursuant to s. 9(1) or 10(1) or (1.1) to an immigrant who is assessed on the basis of factors listed in column I of Schedule I and is not awarded any units of assessment for the factor set out in item 3 thereof [i.e., experience] unless the immigrant
. . . . .
(b) is qualified for and is prepared to engage in employment in a designated occupation."
