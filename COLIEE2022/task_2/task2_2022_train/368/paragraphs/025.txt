The applicant submits that the officer's assumption, with no evidentiary basis, that the store sold food affected her opinion of the applicant's ability to take up the job offer. The stores in question here, operated by the applicant's brother-in-law, were "variety/general stores in cottage country in Ontario", in the words of the applicant's immigration consultant in a letter to the Canadian High Commission in Colombo dated August 9, 1996, and a store in Bobcaygeon, Ontario described as a "mini-supermarket/convenience store", according to the memorandum from the CIC office in Orillia, Ontario to the High Commission, dated November 28, 1995. Apparently, based on these descriptions, the visa officer inferred that the stores sold food. I do not find this inference to be unreasonable. I note that the applicant has not since adduced any evidence to show that the stores did not in fact sell food. In any event, this assumption was not a principal factor on which the assessment of the applicant was based, rather it was a factor, not here contradicted, in regard to the applicant's perceived lack of awareness of the business he would be expected to assist with under the job offer made to him.
