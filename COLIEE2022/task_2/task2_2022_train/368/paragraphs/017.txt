The respondent counters that the applicant has not demonstrated that he had any bookkeeping experience. Further, aside from the applicant's assertions in this proceeding, his application requested an assessment under the occupational heading of "assistant manager, retail". At the hearing of this matter there was some confusion about the job requested for assessment of the applicant's experience, apparently arising from closely similar classification numbers for different jobs. Nevertheless, I conclude that the applicant, at the time of his application, failed to adduce evidence demonstrating that he met occupational requirements of the occupation "bookkeeper" as defined by the CCDO, the department's job classification system. At no time did the applicant make representations to the visa officer that he met the requirements of any other occupation defined in the CCDO than the identified "assistant manager, retail", the occupation for which his application was assessed.
