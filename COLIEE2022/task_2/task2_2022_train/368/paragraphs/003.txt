In a letter dated January 25, 1996 accompanying the applicant's residency application, an immigration consultant, who was assisting the applicant, proposed to the visa officer that the applicant's immigration point count should include 11 points for "Special Vocational Preparation" ("SVP"), found under Schedule I of the
Regulations
. He also indicated that the point total for "occupational demand" under Schedule I should be set at 10. With the points proposed, the consultant urged that this would result in a total point allocation of 79, well above the 65 required by the applicant as an assisted relative.
