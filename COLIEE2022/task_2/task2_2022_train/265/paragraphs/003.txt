I have reached the conclusion that the statutory period under section 44(1) of the
Act
is a strict one and that there is no jurisdiction in this court to waive or extend the time. There is no provision in section 44(1) of the
Act
, such as is found under sectionÂ 41 of the same
Act
, which allows the court to extend the time either before or after the expiration of the time for filing an application.
