Blais, J.
: This is a motion for an order granting applicant leave to file an application pursuant to s. 44 of the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1.

On October 5, 1999, the Access to Information, Assistant-coordinator for Health Canada (
Health Protection Branch
) entered a decision advising applicant that it would disclose certain documents to a requester, should review of the matter before October 25, 1999. The applicant was also advised of the 20 days delay, that he had until October 25, 1999 to seek review of the decision.
[3]
The aforementioned decision was received by the applicant on October 7, 1999.
[4]
Pursuant to counsel's error, an application pursuant to s. 44 of the
ATI Act
was not brought before this court by or before October 27, 1999.

On November 3, 1999, counsel for the applicant advised the Director of Regulatory Affairs of Merck Frosst Canada & Co., Mr. W.H. Guy Saheb, that the time limit for filing the application to seek review of the decision entered on October 5, 1998 (October 5, 1999) had been missed and that he was going to prepare, serve and file a motion for an extension to file the present application in order to incorporate in that application a request for review of the decision entered on October 5, 1999.

Section 44(1) of the
Access to Information Act
, L.R. (1985), c. A-1 provides:
"Third party may apply for a review

[7]
Pursuant to the evidence before the court, the applicant was given notice of the decision pursuant to s. 28(1)(b) on October 7, 1999.
[8]

Act
