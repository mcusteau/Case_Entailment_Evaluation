  This being said, it is of essence that I point out that at the hearing, at the beginning of the Applicants’ submissions, I asked whether the Applicants sought leave of this Court to challenge the Minister’s December 12, 2005 finding that the PMNOC Regulations did not apply to Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets and the Minister’s issuance of a NOC to Apotex on February 1, 2007 for Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets in one application. In response to this question, the Applicants’ counsel clearly stated that leave was not sought as the Applicants believe that there is only one decision at issue and thus that Rule 302 of the Federal Court Rules does not apply to the situation at hand.
