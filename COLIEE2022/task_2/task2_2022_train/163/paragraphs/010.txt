  Although Rule 75 does not set out the criteria for amending a document, the Federal Court of Appeal determined in Canderel Ltd v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue), [1994] 1 F.C. 3 (C.A.), that: 
 
 
 
 â€¦ while it is impossible to enumerate all the factors that a judge must take into consideration in determining whether it is just, in a given case, to authorize an amendment,  
 the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice 
 . [Emphasis added] 
 
 
 
 This test has become the norm for determining whether a motion for amending a document will succeed.
