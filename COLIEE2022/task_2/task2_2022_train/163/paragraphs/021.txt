  I have heard the parties on costs. The Applicants ask for costs in the cause, whereas Apotex asks for a delay so that submissions on costs may be made. It is not necessary that a delay be accorded so that submissions on costs may be made. Given my findings above, I order costs of this motion in favour of Apotex.
