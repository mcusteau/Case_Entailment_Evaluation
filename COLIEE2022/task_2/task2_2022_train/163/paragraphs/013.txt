  In what concerns the case at hand, Apotex states that if the amendments sought by the Applicants were allowed, the Applicants’ judicial review application would seek the review of two separate decisions made by the Minister of Health: the first being the Minister’s decision that the PMNOC Regulations do not apply to Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets; and the second being the Minister’s decision under the Food & Drug Regulations to grant a NOC to Apotex in respect of Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets.
