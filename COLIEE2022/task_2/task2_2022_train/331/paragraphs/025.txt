The
Pourghasemi
test, [1993] F.C.J. No. 232 (Lexis), requires an applicant be physically present in Canada for at least 1095 days. The other two tests take more flexible approaches to the residency requirement. For example the
Koo
test, [1992] F.C.J. No. 1107 (Lexis), requires an assessment of an applicant's absences from Canada with the aim of determining what kind of connection an applicant has with Canada and whether the applicant "regularly, normally or customarily lives" in Canada.
