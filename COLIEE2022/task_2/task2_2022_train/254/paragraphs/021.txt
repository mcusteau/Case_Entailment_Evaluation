Bachoo
case the R-2 letter of June 22, 1989 indicates that she would not meet the criteria even taking into consideration assistance that might be available from a relative in Canada, should she make a formal application. (In fact she had already done so, filing the I.M.M. application and prescribed fee on May 29, 1989.) It is contended that on an Assisted Relative Basis, she ought to have been allocated at least 60 points and invited to an interview where ten additional points would have been available on the "Personal Suitability" criteria.
