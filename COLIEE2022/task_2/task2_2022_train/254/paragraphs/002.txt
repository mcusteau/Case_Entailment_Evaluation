The record in the
Yeung
case was that on which the issue was heard and counsel for Yeung made the principal argument, although this was supplemented by counsel for Bachoo and Kwon who pointed out the factual differences in these cases from that of Yeung. The motion in the
Yeung
case seeks:
"1. An order for a writ of certiorari quashing the decision of the immigration officials of the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong on the staff of the respondents Secretary of State for External Affairs, in which the application of Ivan Ho Yeung for permanent residence in Canada was refused, and
"2. An order for a writ of mandamus directing that:
(i) the respondents consider and process the application of Ivan Ho Yeung for permanent residence in Canada as an assisted relative application in accordance with the
Immigration Act
and
Immigration Regulations
and that this order for mandamus be based on:
(a) that the lock-in of demand in assisted relative cases is at the time the process is initiated, which if necessary includes at least the filing of the application and payment of the processing fee or carrying out of an undertaking in Canada by the relative of the applicant;
(b) that an assisted relative application cannot be paper screened as an independent application in any event without crediting the applicant with the undertaking claimed either in the application form or in any other supporting communication;
(c) that the doctrine of fairness applies to each step in the administrative processing of an immigration application;
(d) that the applicant is entitled to the benefit of policies in force at the time his process has been initiated and that any attempt to subject the applicant to contrary policies once his application is filed is unfair and amounts to high handed, arbitrary and excessive conduct, of a kind to be penalized by solicitor and client costs;
(e) that, it having been established in law that the applicant is entitled to be processed in the category claimed by him, a refusal to assess in such category amounts to high handed, arbitrary and excessive conduct, of a kind to penalized by an order of solicitor and client costs;
(ii) the respondents determine, in accordance with the law, whether or not it would be contrary to the said
Immigration Act
and
Immigration Regulations
to grant a visa for permanent residence in Canada to the applicant, Ivan Ho Yeung.
"3. Costs on a solicitor and client basis.
"4. And for such relief as to this Honourable Court may seem fit."
