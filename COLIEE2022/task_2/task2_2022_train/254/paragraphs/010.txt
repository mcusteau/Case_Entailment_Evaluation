Yeung's application was reviewed in February 1991 and by letter dated April 16, 1991 was refused. Yeung was advised that since the occupational demand factor had been set at zero effective January 30, 1991, and his application had not been "completed" as of that date his application could not be approved, since to "complete" an application it must have been received by the overseas office before January 30, 1991, the undertaking of assistance (if required) having been submitted at a Canada Immigration Centre before January 30, 1991, and the prescribed fee paid before that date.
