In the present three cases it is only in the case of Yeung that the AR 1344 Form was not in the file as of the critical date of January 30, 1991, and in fact has not been filed yet. Oddly enough, however, respondent was willing to settle his application on the basis that both his I.M.M.8 and a 1344 Undertaking of Assistance had been received by December 12, 1989, date of his application. It was conceded that he is entitled to an interview pursuant to the
Lau
case (an unreported judgment of Teitelbaum, J., No. 2640-91 dated November 29, 1991) which held that the visa officer was required to grant applicant an interview pursuant to Factor 9 of Schedule 1 of the
Regulations
as to his suitability.
