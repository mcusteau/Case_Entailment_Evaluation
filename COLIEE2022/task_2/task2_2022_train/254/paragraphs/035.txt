A press release of January 21, 1991 issued by the Honourable Barbara McDougall, Minister of Employment and Immigration reads in part as follows:
"Ottawa -- The Honourable Barbara McDougall, Minister of Employment and Immigration announced today that the general occupations list for independent immigrants will be temporarily closed as of January 30, 1991.
"'As announced in October 1990, the five-year immigration plan allows for the general occupations list to be opened and closed at different times during the planning period,' said the Minister. 'By doing so we ensure that we meet our announced immigration objectives, while minimizing processing times and responding to economic fluctuations.'
"The general occupations list is a tool which helps regulate the independent component of the overall immigration movement.
"The temporary closure of the general occupations list will lead to improved program management and better regulation of the system.
"'These changes will not affect our ability to meet our announced immigration target for 1991. However, these measures will prevent continued build-ups of backlogs abroad and ensure that candidates are not faced with undue processing delays,' added the Minister."
