the motion seeks in support of the mandamus an order that the applications not be paper screened as independent applications without taking into consideration the assisted relative (AR) undertaking. With respect to Yeung, it is contended that the office in Hong Kong insisted on screening even AR applicants as if they were in the independent category making no allowance for points which would be available when an Undertaking of Assistance was received. As such undertakings are only valid for two years and the backlog of applicants there often results in delays of longer than this, there would be no point in filing it, even if it could have been obtained, when the application was filed.
