Counsel for respondent was willing to make certain consent judgments, which counsel for applicants were unwilling to accept, however, as they did not fully comply with the relief sought in the notices of motion. In the
Yeung
case, for example, by letter dated March 3, 1992, it is stated that Yeung is entitled to an interview which would proceed on the basis that his I.M.M.8 application, together with a 1344 Undertaking of Assistance (still forthcoming) were both received by December 12, 1989. This date concession was important, being the date of his application and payment of fee and also as accepting that he would be assessed on the basis of an AR application, although there might have been some doubt as to whether his initial application was not in fact as an independent applicant, although the availability of a relative to assist him was referred to therein. It was stated in court that Mrs. Bachoo would also be entitled to an interview, and it is my understanding that all three applications would be consented to, although, in the absence of documented offers, save for the Yeung letter, the terms are not clear.
