This matter was also dealt with by the Court of Appeal in the
Choi
case (supra). Reference was made to the case of

(1977), 15 N.R. 39; 73 D.L.R.(3d) 139, in which LeDain, J.A., at, p. 146 D.L.R. stated:
"A person who seeks to sponsor someone for admission to Canada has a right to make an application for his admission in the prescribed form and to have his right to sponsor determined upon the basis of such an application. Since such a right cannot be exercised unless the prescribed form can be obtained from the immigration authorities there is a correlative duty to provide the form."
