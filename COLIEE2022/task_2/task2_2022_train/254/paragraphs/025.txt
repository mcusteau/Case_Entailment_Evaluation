case what resulted in the rejection of his application was the reduction of points for occupational demand from eight points at the time of his initial application on September 14, 1988, to one point when the Undertaking of Assistance was filed on December 5, 1990. According to the affidavit submitted with his application, the policy of the Department as set out in the Immigration Manual IS 4.25 appears to have been changed between 1988 and 1989. For independent applicants in order to avoid the prejudice which would result if during the delay (frequently up to three years) in processing the application, the point allocation for occupational demand had been reduced to zero, the points allotted would be considered as having been "locked in" at the date of the application and payment of the filing fee, and the assessment based on these points rather than as at the time of the assessment. The same policy was adopted with respect to assisted relative applications, especially in the light of applicant's inability to obtain the Form 1344 Undertaking of Assessment beforehand to file simultaneously with the I.M.M.8 and prescribed fee.
