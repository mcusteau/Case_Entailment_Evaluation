Section 114 of the
Act
gives very wide powers for making of
Regulations
to carry it into effect. Section 8 of the
Regulations
provides that (except for immigrants in specified categories, which is not the issue here) units of assessment established in Schedule 1 of the
Regulations
will be considered in establishing whether the applicant "will be able to become successfully established in Canada".
