  I agree with the respondent. To certify a question the Court must be satisfied that the answer would be dispositive of the appeal: Bath v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1999] F.C.J. No. 1207 (F.C.T.D.) (QL). Even if the Court of Appeal were to determine that a PRRA officer had some obligation to consider the best interests of a Canadian child, that result would not be dispositive of an appeal of this matter. As I have noted above, there was no evidence submitted nor representations made to the officer respecting the child. I therefore decline to certify the proposed question.
