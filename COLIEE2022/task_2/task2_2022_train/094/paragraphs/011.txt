 [11] 
  There are two substantive issues arising from the record and the applicant's submissions: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the PRRA officer err in not considering the interests of the applicant's child in the context of a risk assessment? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the PRRA officer err by not properly assessing the application under section 97 of IRPA?
