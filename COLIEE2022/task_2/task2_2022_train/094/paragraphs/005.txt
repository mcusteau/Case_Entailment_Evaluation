  On November 29, 2005 the applicant filed a PRRA review application presenting additional evidence. This evidence has also been filed in support of this application. The respondent objects to the applicant's attempt to introduce evidence that was not before the decision-maker and to rely on this evidence in his written and oral submissions. In particular, the documents filed in Exhibit F to the applicant's affidavit were not before the PRRA officer when she rendered her decision. The respondent submits that those documents and paragraphs 21-29 of the applicant's affidavit should be struck from the record.
