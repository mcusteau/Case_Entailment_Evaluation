  In Omar, judicial review of a PRRA decision was granted where the Court was satisfied on the basis of fresh evidence that "very exceptional circumstances" required that the matter be remitted for reconsideration. In Salem, the Court, in granting a stay of removal, found that there was a serious issue to be tried and that the risk of irreparable harm had been established due to new evidence of a significant intervening event analogous to the situation in Omar.
