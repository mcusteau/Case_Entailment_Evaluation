Citizenship legislation is the mechanism whereby a society achieves regeneration, retaining its identity while its constituent members are born and die, arrive and depart. In order to determine whether the legislative distinction resulting from the exclusion of a category of individuals from the status of citizenship is discriminatory, a purposive and contextual approach is required. In this regard, the contextual factors which determine whether the impugned legislation has the effect of demeaning a claimant's dignity must be construed and examined from the perspective of the claimant. The focus of the inquiry is both subjective and objective.
