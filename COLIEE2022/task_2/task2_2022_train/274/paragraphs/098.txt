At the time of its adoption, the
Act
served the immediate purpose of securing Canadian participation in the permanent Court of international justice (see Note 14). But clearly Parliament was also pursuing concurrent and broader long-term objectives. The
Act
conferred the status of a "Canadian national" to persons outside Canada who may not have been "Canadian citizens" within the meaning of the
1910 Immigration Act
, such as the wife of a Canadian citizen who may not have landed in Canada (see Note 15). Moreover, by the principle of jus sanguinis, any person born out of Canada, whose father was a Canadian national at the time of that person's birth, was also a Canadian national (see Note 16). This is akin to citizenship by descent as we know it today in citizenship legislation.
