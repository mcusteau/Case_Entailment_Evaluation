[283]
To the extent that subsection 3(1), paragraphs 3(1)(b), (d) and (e), and section 8 of the current
Citizenship Act
, when read together, authorize the dismissal of the Applicant's application for proof of citizenship on the ground that:
(a) the citizenship of a child born out of wedlock before February 15, 1977, outside Canada, can only be derived from the child's mother, or
(b) there is an automatic loss of citizenship if an application for retention of citizenship has not been made by the child born out of wedlock, before February 15, 1977, outside Canada, between the age of 21 and 24 years,
I find that these provisions contravene subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
and are not justified under section 1 of the
Charter
.
