As mentioned by Professor Ruth Sullivan in the introduction of
Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes
, supra, at 1, more than 25 years ago, Elmer Driedger described an approach to the interpretation of statutes which he called the "modern principle":
"Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament."
