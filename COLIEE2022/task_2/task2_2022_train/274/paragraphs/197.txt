[197]
The Supreme Court of Canada allowed Benner's appeal. Justice Iacobucci, writing for a unanimous Court, held that the better way to characterize his complaint was in terms of a status or condition that imposed a disadvantage on him that persisted after the coming into force of the equality provision of the
Charter
. The discrimination occurred when the applicant was refused citizenship on the basis of that status, and the refusal took place in 1987. Therefore, the applicant was entitled to challenge the refusal of citizenship under the
Charter
(the Court went on to hold that there was a breach of Benner's equality rights, and he was successful in challenging the decision and the statutory provision underlying it.).
