From 1921 to 1947 Canada did not adopt any other law affecting nationality. That being said, the concept of "Canadian national" did not prove to be purely "symbolic". For instance, in 1937, it was specifically used to prevent Canadian nationals from enrolling in the Spanish civil war (see
House of Commons Debates
(5 April 1946) at 603). Indeed, the
Foreign Enlistment Act
, S.C. 1937, c. 32, makes it an offence for a "Canadian national" to enlist with a foreign state at war with a friendly state, and to engage in any of the acts prohibited by statute. In so doing, Parliament repealed, insofar as it was a part of the law of Canada, a previous
Imperial Act
dealing with the foreign enrolment of British subjects, that is The
Foreign Enlistment Act 1870
(U.K.), 33 & 34 Vict., c. 90.
