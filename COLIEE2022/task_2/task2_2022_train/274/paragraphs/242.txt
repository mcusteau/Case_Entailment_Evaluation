The third category of cases involving the loss of citizenship occurred where the individual served in the armed forces of a country which was at war with Canada. While the loss of citizenship was "automatic", the law required that the individual be a national or citizen of such country and provided that loss did not occur where the latter, under the law of this other country, became a national or citizen of such country when it was at war with Canada (see section 17 of the
1970 Citizenship Act
). I see no problem with due process.
