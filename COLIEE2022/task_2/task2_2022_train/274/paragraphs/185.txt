[185]
The Respondent notes that paragraph 3(1)(d) of the current
Citizenship Act
simply states that if one was a citizen immediately before February 15, 1977, then one remained a citizen on the coming into force of the current
Citizenship Act
on February 15, 1977. The Respondent then concludes that this provision, "enacted pre-
Charter
, crystallized the status quo for the purposes of assessing a continuous (or continuing) status - it froze the past as the past" (written representations of the Respondent, 31 July 2006, at para. 28).
