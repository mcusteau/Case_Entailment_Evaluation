The fourth category of cases is problematic. Natural-born Canadian citizens by descent (jus sanguinis) of the first generation born outside Canada prior and after 1947 would automatically lose their citizenship (and nationality) unless they had a place of domicile in Canada or had submitted an application for retention of their Canadian citizenship between their 21st and 24th birthdays (see subsections 4(2) and 5(2) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
). Furthermore, there was a registration requirement with respect to the children born after 1947. This also mean that citizenship may be denied to Canadian military's dependents born abroad, in wedlock, between 1947 and 1977 in the case their parents were unaware of the fact that the birth had to be registered at a consulate or with the Minister within two years after its occurrence or within such extended period as the Minister may authorize in special cases (paragraph 5(1)(b)(ii) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
).
