The Applicant submits in this regard that paragraphs 3(1)(b), 3(1)(d), 3(1)(e) and section 8 of the current
Citizenship Act
perpetuate the pre-existing differential treatment of persons that existed in the
1947 Citizenship Act
, the
1952 Citizenship Act
, the
1970 Citizenship Act
, and in the
1977 Citizenship Act
up to this day, which is contrary to section 15(1) of the
Charter
(the equality rights issue). It is also submitted that by necessary implication, the current
Citizenship Act
applies the extinguishment provisions of subsections 4(2) and 5(2) of the
1952 Citizenship Act
up to and including the date of February 14, 1977, which is contrary to paragraphs 1(a) and 1(e) of the
Bill of Rights
and to section 7 of the
Charter
(the due process issue).
