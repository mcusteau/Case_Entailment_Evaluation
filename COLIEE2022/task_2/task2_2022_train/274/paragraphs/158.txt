[158]
The Applicant spent all his life believing that he was "half Canadian" and "half British". That description was based on having had a declaration of Canadian citizenship, a passport, and a father who was a naturally born Canadian. The present recourse is based on the assumption that Canadian law does not prohibit dual nationality or citizenship (an assumption that the Respondent has not challenged here).
