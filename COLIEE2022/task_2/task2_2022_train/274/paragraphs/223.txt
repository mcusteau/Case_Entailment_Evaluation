[223]
The main difficulty with this proposition raised by the Respondent is that the Applicant's citizenship status is not derived from the application of paragraph 4(1)(b) of the 1947, 1952 or the
1970 Citizenship Acts
. As I have already decided, Order in Council, P.C. 858 is tantamount to the issuance or granting of a certificate of citizenship by the Minister or Parliament. I fail to see how a loss of citizenship after January 1, 1954 under the operation of subsection 4(2) of the
1952 Citizenship Act
(as amended by section 13 of the
1953 Citizenship Amendment Act
) or the
1970 Citizenship Act
could have occurred in this case. Indeed, paragraph 4(1)(b) of the
1947, 1952 or 1970 Citizenship Acts
deny citizenship status to children born out of wedlock of non-Canadian mothers, a point that I will address later on in these reasons when disposing of the equality rights issue.
