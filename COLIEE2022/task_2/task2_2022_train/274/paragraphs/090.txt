I also note that the status of British subject did not, by itself, constitute a licence to enter, work, live or remain in Canada (see Notes 1 and 2). In this respect, in an annotation to the
Thirty-Nine Hindus
case (1913), 15 D.L.R. 189 (B.C.S.C.), A. H. F. Lefroy, K.C., provides the following comments and explanations, which bring into light Parliament's objectives in developing, as early as 1910, a concept of "Canadian citizenship":
"But what is of more importance in connection with this subject is that the Imperial Government has officially conceded the right of this Dominion, and the other self-governing Dominions to legislate for the exclusion of immigrants, though British subjects. Lord Crewe, Secretary of State for India, speaking at the last Imperial conference, said:
'I fully recognize, as His Majesty's Government fully recognize, that as the Empire is constituted, the idea that it is possible to have an absolutely free interchange between all individuals who are subjects of the Crown, that is to say, that every subject of the King, whoever he may be, or wherever he may live, has a natural right to travel or still more to settle in any part of the Empire, is a view which we fully admit, and I fully admit as representing the India Office, to be one which cannot be maintained.
As the Empire is constituted it is still impossible that we can have a free coming and going of all the subjects of the King throughout all parts of the Empire. Or to put the thing in another way, nobody can attempt to dispute the right of the self-governing Dominions to decide for themselves whom, in each case, they will admit as citizens of their respective Dominions
