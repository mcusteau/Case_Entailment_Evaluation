[175]
There is no distinction in Order in Council, P.C. 858 between the dependents who have landed before and those who landed after January 1, 1947. The legal distinction introduced by the Respondent has the effect of placing the dependents who landed between January 1, 1947 and May 15, 1947 in a better position than dependents who landed prior to January 1, 1947. This was certainly not the intention of the drafters of Order in Council, P.C. 858 or of the Governor in Council in promulgating the same. Therefore, I cannot accept the restrictive interpretation proposed by the Respondent (by analogy see
Schavernoch v. Foreign Claims Commission
, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 1092; 44 N.R. 166).
