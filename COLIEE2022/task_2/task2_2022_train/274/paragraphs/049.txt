It is submitted by the Respondent that "citizenship" is a creature of statute and that it has no legal meaning apart from statute: see
Solis v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 407; 254 N.R. 362 (F.C.A.). The Respondent concedes that the Applicant was a "British subject" and also a "Canadian national" within the meaning of the
Canadian Nationals Act
, S.C. 1921, c. 4, as revised in R.S.C. 1927, c. 21 (the
Canadian Nationals Act
) at the time of his birth.
