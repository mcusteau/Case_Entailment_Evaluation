In republics, the state has come to be identified with the nation itself and the individuals belonging to the nation owe allegiance to the state. From an historical perspective, this is not true for individuals born in a country where a monarchy exists. They owe allegiance to the sovereign. This is the case in the United Kingdom (see Note 5).
