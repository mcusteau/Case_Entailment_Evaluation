I pause to mention here that the effect of "legitimation" on the citizenship or nationality of a British subject or citizen was no longer an issue in 1949 under English law. Indeed, a person legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents is treated by statute, as from the date of the marriage or 1st January 1949, whichever is later, as if he had been born legitimate, in all questions relating to the determination of whether the legitimate person is a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies, or was a British subject immediately before 1st January 1949: see
British Nationality Act, 1948
(U.K.), 11 & 12 Geo. VI, c. 56, ss. 23(1), 34(2). This overrules the previous law as laid down in
Shedden
, supra, and
Abraham
, supra, (see
Halsbury's Laws of England
, supra, at para. 151).
