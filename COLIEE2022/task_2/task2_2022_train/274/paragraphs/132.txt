It is clear that the purpose of section 6 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
is to regulate the situation of minors born outside Canada who were never lawfully admitted to Canada prior to 1947. Therefore, section 6 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
does not apply to the case at bar (see Note 19). Moreover, under the
1910 Immigration Act
, when the Applicant and his mother left Canada in October 1946, they did not lose the status of "Canadian citizens" that they were deemed to have upon their landing under Order in Council, P.C. 858.
