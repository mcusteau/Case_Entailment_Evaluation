Accordingly, whatever status the Applicant and his mother may have had under the
1947 Citizenship Act
, I find that under Order in Council P.C. 858, the
1910 Immigration Act
and the
1947 Immigration Amendment Act
, they both had the legal right to enter, land, establish a domicile, remain, leave or return to Canada. (At the hearing, the Respondent's counsel conceded that such right existed until the enactment of the
1970 Citizenship Act
.).
