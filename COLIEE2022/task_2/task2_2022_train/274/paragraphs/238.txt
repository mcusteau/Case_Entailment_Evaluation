[238]
Article 15 of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
, GA Res. 217 (III), UN GAOR, 3d Sess., Supp. No. 13, UN Doc. A/810 (1948) 71, recognizes that everyone has the right to nationality and that no one shall be
arbitrarily
deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality. In this regard, I note that subsection 46(1) of the
1947 Canadian Citizenship Act
prescribed that:
"46(1) Notwithstanding the repeal of the Naturalization Act and the Canadian Nationals Act,
this Act is not to be construed or interpreted as depriving any person who is a Canadian National, a British subject or an alien as defined in the said Acts or in any other law in force in Canada of the national status he possesses at the time of the coming into force of this Act
." (Emphasis added)
