Anita Glynos was nevertheless convinced that she had the right under the
1977 Citizenship Act
to pass on her Canadian citizenship to her son Jason and she commenced corresponding with the Secretary of State. She eventually submitted an application for citizenship on behalf of her son Jason on August 6, 1987. On December 1, 1987, the Secretary of State refused to grant the application on the basis, essentially, that paragraph 5(2)(b) of the
1977 Citizenship Act
was in his view applicable only to persons who had never been Canadian citizens. On September 12, 1989, Anita Glynos and Jason Glynos commenced an action before the Trial Division of the Federal Court of Canada and sought a declaration that, on the true construction of paragraph 5(2)(b), Jason Glynos was eligible for a grant of Canadian citizenship. They also asked the Court to issue a writ of mandamus to compel the Secretary of State to grant Canadian citizenship to Jason Glynos. While the relief sought is couched in terms that relate to the
Charter
, the Trial Judge and counsel for all parties addressed the question as being one of statutory interpretation in addition to being one of application of the
Charter
(see
Glynos v. Canada
(1991), 42 F.T.R.183; 13 Imm. L.R.(2d) 83 (T.D.).
