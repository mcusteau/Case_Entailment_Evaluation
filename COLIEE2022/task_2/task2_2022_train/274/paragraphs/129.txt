The provisions defining citizenship in the
1947 Citizenship Act
remained practically the same for more than 30 years. It is noted that a provision was specifically added in 1950 to empower the Minister to grant a certificate of citizenship in case of legal adoption or legitimation if the male adopter or father was a Canadian citizen (see section 6 of the
1950 Citizenship Amendment Act
). The Minister also kept, until the coming into force of the current
Citizenship Act
, his discretionary power to grant a certificate of citizenship to a minor in any special case whether or not the conditions required by the
1947 Citizenship Act
had been complied with.
