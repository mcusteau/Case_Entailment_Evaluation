Based on the evidence on record, I find that notwithstanding the various legal impediments found in the
1910 Immigration Act
, special treatment was afforded to the dependents of the members of the Canadian Armed Forces who served during World War II, including the Applicant and his mother. Indeed, apart from the requirement of a medical examination, other conditions for entry and landing in Canada of war brides and their children were generally waived by the Canadian government. Moreover, where the members of the Canadian Armed Forces were "Canadian citizens" or had "Canadian domicile", their dependents were granted the same status. Reference is made in this regard to two Orders in Council taken under the authority of the
War Measures Act
, R.S.C. 1927, c. 206 (the
War Measures Act
) (see section 3 of Order in Council, P.C. 858, supra; compare to section 2 of Order in Council, P.C. 1944-7318 (21 September 1944), which was revoked by Order in Council, P.C. 858).
