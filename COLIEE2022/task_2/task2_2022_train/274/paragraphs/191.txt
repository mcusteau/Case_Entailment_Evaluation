[191]
The statutory provisions under challenge in
Benner
, supra, were paragraphs 3(1)(e), 5(2)(b) and 22 of the
1977 Citizenship Act
. The Supreme Court of Canada found them to impose more onerous requirements on those claiming Canadian citizenship based on maternal lineage than on those claiming citizenship based on paternal lineage. For children born before February 15, 1977, the
1977 Citizenship Act
distinguished between those born of a Canadian father, who were automatically entitled to register as citizens, and those born of a Canadian mother, who had to apply for citizenship, which involved passing a security check.
