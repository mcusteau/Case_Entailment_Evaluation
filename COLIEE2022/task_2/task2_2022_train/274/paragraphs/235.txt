Loss of citizenship for a person who is currently residing in Canada has great consequences. The content of the procedural guarantees must be directly proportionate to the importance and impact an automatic loss of citizenship can have on the life of the person who is affected. If the person was not a permanent resident in Canada before having obtained citizenship, he or she may be in Canada without any status and subject to removal proceedings under current immigration proceedings. For the person who is residing outside Canada, he or she may be denied entry into Canada (unless he or she comes as a visitor). Such a person will naturally have to obtain a permanent resident visa before being able to establish himself or herself in Canada.
