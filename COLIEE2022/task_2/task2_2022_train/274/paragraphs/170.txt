The Respondent acknowledges that the Citizenship Officer did not consider the effects of Order in Council, P.C. 858. The Order had not been repealed by Parliament and had full force and effect on January 1, 1947 and remained in force until May 15, 1947. However, the Respondent submits that the Citizenship Officer correctly applied section 4 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
and relies, in this respect, on
Minister of Employment and Immigration v. Bell
(1996), 197 N.R. 315; 136 D.L.R.(4th) 286 (F.C.A.) and
Kelly v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1880; 161 F.T.R. 93 (T.D.) (see Note 22). Moreover, the Respondent submits that Order in Council, P.C. 858 is limited to the application of Canadian immigration law and asserts it does not confer Canadian citizenship status to the war brides and their children.
