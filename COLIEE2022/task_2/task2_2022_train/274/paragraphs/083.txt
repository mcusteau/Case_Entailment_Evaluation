Since 1948, the label "British subject" has generally referred to a person who is a "Commonwealth citizen". Therefore, the national and the citizenship status of such a person (who is not actually a British citizen or national) will generally be defined by legislation duly adopted within each country of the Commonwealth (see Note 13).
