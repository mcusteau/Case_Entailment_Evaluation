All states owe protection to their nationals or citizens. The issuance of a passport is closely connected to the concept of State protection and has significant legal consequences, including the security and liberty of movement of the individual. Today's Canadian passports are still issued in the name of Her Majesty the Queen and constitute the single most important domestic and international identity document a Canadian citizen or national can carry when he travels inside or outside Canada.
