That being said, two procedures existed by which an "alien" could become a British subject with some of the rights of citizenship. First, "naturalization" granted all the legal rights of citizenship except political rights (e.g. holding office). Naturalization required that an act of Parliament be passed. Second, "denization", like naturalization, allowed a person to gain the rights of citizenship other than political rights. However, denization was granted by Letters Patent, bestowed by the King as an exercise of royal prerogative. Denization was therefore an exercise of executive power, whereas naturalization was an exercise of legislative power.
