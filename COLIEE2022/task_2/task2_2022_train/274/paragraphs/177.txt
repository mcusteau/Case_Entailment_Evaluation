I conclude that Order in Council, P.C. 858, whose effect was prolonged to May 15, 1947, is tantamount to a statutory grant of Canadian citizenship to the war brides and their children who landed in Canada prior to May 15, 1947, where their husband and their father were born in Canada and became a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947 upon the coming into force of the
1947 Citizenship Act
. Had these Orders in Council been taken after the coming into force of the
1947 Citizenship Act
, I have no doubt that the words used would have reflected the intention of the Governor in Council of conferring to these war brides and children "citizenship status" for all purposes. I therefore conclude that on January 1, 1947, the Applicant's mother and the Applicant himself were Canadian citizens for all purposes.
