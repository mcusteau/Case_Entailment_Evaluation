The general principles governing a section 1
Charter
analysis have been set out many times since the leading case of
Oakes
, supra. In
Benner
, supra, Justice Iacobucci referred to these principles as they were re-stated in
Egan and Nesbit v. Canada
, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513; 182 N.R. 161 at 605:
"... A limitation to a constitutional guarantee will be sustained once two conditions are met. First, the objective of the legislation must be pressing and substantial. Second, the means chosen to attain this legislative end must be reasonable and demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society. In order to satisfy the second requirement, three criteria must be satisfied: (1) the rights violation must be rationally connected to the aim of the legislation; (2) the impugned provision must minimally impair the
Charter
guarantee; and (3) there must be a proportionality between the effect of the measure and its objective so that the attainment of the legislative goal is not outweighed by the abridgement of the right. In all s. 1 cases the burden of proof is with the government to show on a balance of probabilities that the violation is justifiable."
