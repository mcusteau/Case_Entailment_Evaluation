A great number of children of Canadian soldiers born during the war in England and Holland were born out of wedlock: see Melynda Jarratt, supra. In 1946, the fact that the Applicant was born out of wedlock would not have posed a problem in terms of his British nationality or citizenship. He was undoubtedly a British subject by reason of his birth in England (jus soli principle). However, the war children born outside England, such as the 6000 children born in Holland, were not in the same position as the Applicant in terms of British nationality or citizenship. The jus soli principle did not apply to them because their birth was outside His Majesty's allegiance. Unless they were born in wedlock, the children born in Holland would need to be "naturalized" in order to become British subjects (like any other children born outside His Majesty's allegiance).
