[184]
More particularly, the Applicant notes that paragraph 4(1)(b) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
is not referred to in the current
Citizenship Act
, thereby distinguishing the group of people who were born before January 1, 1947 from the group of people who were born after January 1, 1947. The combined effect of paragraphs 3(1)(d) and (e) of the current
Citizenship Act
is to prohibit a person from making an application for resumption of citizenship based on the fact that they had lost their citizenship prior to February 15, 1977 if they were born before January 1, 1947 but not if they were born after January 1, 1947. It is further submitted that the pre-existing differential treatment based on whether the claimant was born within or out of wedlock was perpetuated by requiring that the status had to have been already "acquired" for citizenship in order to be conferred on the claimant.
