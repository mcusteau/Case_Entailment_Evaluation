[186]
With respect to the application of the
Charter
protections in this case, notably the rights guaranteed in sections 7 and 15(1), the Respondent submits that these provisions cannot be invoked by the Applicant to correct any wrong or discrimination that occurred prior to the coming into force of the
Charter
or its equality provision (April 17, 1982 and April 17, 1985 respectively), either under the former citizenship legislation or the current
Citizenship Act
. The Respondent submits that the Applicant, who was born before February 15, 1977, is in the same position as the applicants in
Dubey v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration)
(2002), 222 F.T.R. 1; 2002 FCT 582; and
Wilson v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2003), 244 F.T.R. 148; 2003 FC 1475, in which two judges of this Court confirmed the legality of decisions rendered by Citizenship Officers which denied their applications for proof of citizenship (see Note 23).
