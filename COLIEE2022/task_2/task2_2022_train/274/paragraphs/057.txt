The original concept of citizenship is best described by professor Kaplan, who wrote at 247:
"Athens was the best known of the Greek city-states, and it was a democracy in the sense that all citizens participated in government, as electors and as officials.
However, not all persons could become citizens. Women, slaves, foreigners, and resident aliens were denied this status and enjoyed only limited membership in the community
.
"The status of citizenship was further refined in Rome. Citizenship was more widely granted than had been the case in the Greek city-states but was still quite restrictive.
The Roman Republic distinguished between civil rights, meaning equality before the law without participation in government, and political rights, or membership in the sovereign body with full political participation. Only persons who had both civil and political rights had citizenship rights, also referred to as 'freedom of the city.
' As the boundaries or Rome, and then the Roman Empire, expanded and grew, citizenship was extended to the conquered peoples: 'It is interesting to note that initially it was citizenship as the right of membership within the City of Rome, and only subsequently did it become citizenship in the wider sense of being a member of the Empire.'"
