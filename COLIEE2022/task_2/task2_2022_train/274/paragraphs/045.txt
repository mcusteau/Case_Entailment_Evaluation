The distinction between "citizens" and "non-citizens" is recognized in the
Charter
where citizenship is a required qualification for voting rights (s. 3), mobility rights (s. 6) and minority language educational rights (s. 23). However, it may at the same time constitute an "analogous ground of discrimination" under section 15 of the
Charter
in other instances of legislative preference (see
Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143; 91 N.R. 255), and any such "discrimination" must be justified under section 1 of the
Charter
(
R. v. Oakes
, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103; 65 N.R. 87; 14 O.A.C. 335).
