While
Benner
was rendered before
Law
, it is still useful in the present context (see Note 28). Justice Iacobucci stated in
Benner
, at paragraphs 70, 72:
"The impugned provisions of the
1977 Citizenship Act
expressly distinguish between children born abroad before 1977 to Canadian mothers and children born abroad before 1977 to Canadian fathers.
(. . . . .)
"This appears clearly to demonstrate a lack of equal benefit of the law."
