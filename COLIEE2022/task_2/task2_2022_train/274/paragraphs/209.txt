I have also considered the decision rendered by this Court in
Veleta v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2005] F.C.J. No. 801; 350 N.R. 94; 2006 FCA 138 which is also cited by the parties. The decision under review denied the Applicants' application for proof of citizenship under paragraph 3(1)(b) of the current
Citizenship Act
because they were born outside Canada after February 14, 1977, and neither of their parents were citizens. They were denied citizenship because their grandfather was born out of wedlock. Accordingly, their father could not have been a Canadian citizen as well. In that context, the Court determined that the applicants sought to right a historical wrong that occurred long before section 15 came into effect (see Note 26). That being said, I note that on April 19, 2006, about a month and a half before the present proceeding was heard (which perhaps explains why counsel failed to mention the Federal Court of Appeal judgment), the decision of this Court in
Veleta
was set aside. The Federal Court of Appeal found that procedural fairness demanded that the grandfather be given a chance to appear and make representations as to his right to Canadian citizenship: see
Veleta v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2006 FCA 138. The judgment of the Federal Court of Appeal is discussed in the next section (see XIV. The due process issue).
