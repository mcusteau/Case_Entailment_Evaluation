[269]
With respect to a child born
outside Canada after February 14, 1977
, the current
Citizenship Act
provides that the latter is a citizen, provided that at the time of birth one of his parents, other than a parent who adopted him -, was a citizen. It does not matter that at the time of the child's birth, his parents were married or not. As long as one of the natural parents is a citizen, that child automatically becomes a citizen (see ss. 3(1)(b) of the current
Citizenship Act
). The children born outside Canada of a Canadian citizen who has himself being born outside Canada upon birth is also a Canadian citizen (jus sanguinis). That being said, there is no requirement under the current
Citizenship Act
that a child of the first generation makes an application for retention of citizenship resides or establishes connection with Canada. However, a second generation child ceases to be a citizen on attaining the age of 28, unless he makes an application to retain his citizenship and, registers as a citizen and either resides in Canada for a period at least one year immediately preceding the date of his application or establishes a substantial connection with Canada (see section 8 of the current
Citizenship Act
).
