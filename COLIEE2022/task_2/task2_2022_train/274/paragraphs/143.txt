Part II of the
1970 Citizenship Act
deals with Canadian citizens other than natural-born. For the present proceeding, it is not necessary to review it, except insofar as to mention again that the Applicant's mother was a "Canadian citizen" being a British subject who had "Canadian domicile" and being married to a man who would have been a natural-born Canadian citizen, if this
Act
had come into force immediately before the marriage (see paragraph 9(1)(d) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
).
