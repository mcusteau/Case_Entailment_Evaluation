[163]
In 2006, some sixty years after the end of the Second World War, probably half of the war brides and a large number of their children are still alive and living in Canada. Like the Applicant their claim to Canadian citizenship may be based upon their landing in Canada pursuant to Order in Council, P.C. 858. If the interpretation of the Respondent is correct and the Court is wrong, it follows that the majority of these war children (many who were "born out of wedlock") are not "natural-born Canadian citizens" (despite the fact that they may have lived all their life in Canada). This means that like any other permanent resident in Canada they would all need to apply for a grant of citizenship by the Minister. (For instance, the children born out of wedlock in Holland were "aliens" in 1947 and could not derive Canadian citizenship under the jus soli or jus sanguinis principles.)
