  I will add, however, that this Court must show considerable deference ( 
 Singh v The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2006 FC 565) in determining whether the findings are justified, transparent and intelligible and fall "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , above). It is not up to this Court to reassess the evidence that was before the panel ( 
 Zrig v Canada (The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FCA 178, [2003] 3 FC 761 at paragraph 42).
