  This case is different from  
 Capitaine v The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2008 FC 98, to which the applicant refers, in several respects. Namely, the applicant in the case at bar did not attempt to move to another state in Mexico before claiming refugee protection in Canada. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any other state-or even city-in Mexico would not have been able to protect her. The applicant even stated that her mother had to move to another city in Mexico after her attacker, Mr. Valencia, uttered threats, and that, following that move, her mother did not receive any more threats.
