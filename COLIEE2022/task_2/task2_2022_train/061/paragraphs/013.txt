  One interpretation of these words might be that apparent or perceived contradictions in separate spousal interviews need not, as a matter of procedural fairness, be brought to the attention of an applicant for response and that the failure to do so goes only to weight. However, I do not think this interpretation is consistent with other principles enunciated in the decision or, indeed, consistent with the immediately preceding sentence. If the failure to permit an applicant to respond to any perceived or apparent contradictions arising from information obtained in the absence of the applicant does not constitute a breach of a duty of fairness, it is difficult to see that there are any procedural safeguards applicable to s. 114(2) proceedings at all. Yet Hugessen, J.A., does indicate that a duty of fairness exists, although its content is minimal. Further, Hugessen, J.A., expressly states that an applicant must be given an opportunity to respond to extrinsic evidence, not brought forward by the applicant. I think these words must mean that in a s. 114(2) process, an immigration officer need not confront an applicant with all the impressions and conclusions that the immigration officer has or reaches, nor with contradictions that arise from evidence and information presented by or in the presence of the applicant. But for extrinsic evidence not brought forward by the applicant, the failure to provide an opportunity for a response could constitute a breach of the duty of fairness.
