  The only indication he gives that a duty of fairness exists at all in these cases is that if an immigration officer relies on "extrinsic evidence, not brought forward by the applicant", he must give the applicant the chance to respond to this evidence. At p. 2 Hugessen, J.A., states: 
 
 
 
 "The officer is not required to put before the applicant any tentative conclusions she may be drawing from the material before her, not even as to apparent contradictions that concern her.  
 Of course, if she is going to rely on extrinsic evidence, not brought forward by the applicant, she must give him a chance to respond to such evidence. 
  In the case of perceived contradictions, however, the failure to draw them specifically to the applicant's attention may go to the weight that should later be attached to them but does not affect the fairness of the decision." (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added)
