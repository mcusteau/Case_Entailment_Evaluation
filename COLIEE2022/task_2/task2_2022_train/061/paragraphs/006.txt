  It was open to Mr. Allen to conduct his humanitarian and compassionate review in one of two ways. He could have conducted an entirely independent examination without regard to Ms. Mammoliti's recommendation. Alternatively, he could rely on Ms. Mammoliti's recommendation and determine whether there had been any changes since her recommendation that would result in a different conclusion than the one reached by her. He chose to do the latter. In doing so, he adopted Ms. Mammoliti's recommendations as his own. Any breaches of procedural fairness she may have committed in the process she followed in arriving at her recommendation must affect Mr. Allen's recommendation. If her recommendation is legally in error because of a breach of a duty of fairness, I do not see how it becomes cleansed of that error when it is adopted by Mr. Allen. It was open to the applicant, in my view, to challenge the Finnerty decision based upon the Allen recommendation which adopted the recommendation made by Ms. Mammoliti. The applicant, in challenging the decision of Mr. Finnerty, is not precluded from addressing the process followed by Ms. Mammoliti.
