 [2] 
  There are two issues on this judicial review: 
 
 
 
 (1) Is the application for judicial review brought out of time? 
 
 
 
 (2) Was it necessary for the immigration officer to confront the applicant with  
 
 
 
 (a) contradictions between her evidence and the evidence of her spouse taken separately from the applicant, and 
 
 
 
 (b) prejudicial material contained in the immigration file?
