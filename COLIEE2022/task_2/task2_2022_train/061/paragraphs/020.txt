  The term "extrinsic evidence" is normally used with reference to ambiguous documents. In that context, extrinsic evidence is evidence of statements, facts or circumstances that do not appear on the face of the document or that are not referred to in the document, but which serve to explain, vary or contradict the document. The introduction of such evidence is not often allowed. In the case at bar, having regard to the words "not brought forward by the applicant" used by Hugessen, J.A., to qualify the term "extrinsic evidence", and his reference to  
 Muliadi 
 , I interpret the term "extrinsic evidence not brought forward by the applicant" as evidence of which the applicant is unaware because it comes from an outside source. This would be evidence of which the applicant has no knowledge and on which the immigration officer intends to rely in making a decision affecting the applicant. While this would include information obtained from an outside party as in  
 Muliadi 
 , I fail to see why it would not also include evidence from a spouse obtained separately from the applicant, or other information in the immigration file that did not come from the applicant, of which the applicant could not reasonably be expected to have knowledge.
