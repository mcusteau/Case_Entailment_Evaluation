  Counsel for the respondent submits that the extrinsic evidence referred to by Hugessen, J.A., in  
 Shah 
  is information from outside sources of which the applicant would have no knowledge. He was of the view that the evidence obtained by an immigration officer from an applicant's spouse in a separate interview was not extrinsic evidence. In  
 Muliadi v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1986] 2 F.C. 205; 66 N.R. 8 (F.C.A.), referred to in  
 Shah 
 , the information to which the entrepreneurial immigrant applicant had the right of response was information from the Province of Ontario negatively assessing the applicant's business plan. In  
 Muliadi 
  the Federal Court of Appeal found that the immigration officer, before disposing of the permanent residence application, had a duty to inform the applicant of the negative assessment of the Province of Ontario and give him a fair opportunity of correcting or contradicting it before making a final decision.
