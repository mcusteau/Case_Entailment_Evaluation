 [17] 
  As set out in the trial decision in  
 Shah 
 , 
  (Shah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1992), 55 F.T.R. 87), the issue was whether there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for landing from within Canada based on a marriage between an applicant and a permanent resident of Canada. In that case, the immigration officer concluded that the marriage had been entered into solely for immigration purposes and that there were therefore insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for landing from within Canada.
