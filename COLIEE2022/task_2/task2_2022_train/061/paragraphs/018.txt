  An important distinction from the case at bar, however, is that in  
 Shah 
 , the immigration officer interviewed the applicant and his spouse separately  
 and then together 
 , over a three hour period, while in the case at bar, Ms. Mammoliti only interviewed the spouses separately. At p. 92 of his decision in  
 Shah 
 , Jerome, A.C.J., found: 
 
 
 
 "The applicant and his wife were given ample opportunity to explain the discrepancies in their answers given at their separate interviews." 
 
 
 
 He found no procedural unfairness in the process followed by the immigration officer and dismissed the judicial review.
