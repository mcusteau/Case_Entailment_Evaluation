[26]
Prior to the enactment of ss. 220(3.1) neither the Minister of National Revenue ("Minister") nor the Courts had the authority to waive or cancel interest accrued by operation of statute with regard to unpaid amounts of taxes. This new provision gave the Minister the authority to decide whether or not to cancel or waive interest or penalties.
