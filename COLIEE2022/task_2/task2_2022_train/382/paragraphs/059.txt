I have carefully reviewed the record before the Court and the written and oral submissions of the Applicant and the Respondent. I cannot find a reviewable error in either of the fairness decisions. The Applicant's fairness applications were fully and fairly reviewed at both levels and she was given ample opportunity and assistance to make her case. The relevant factors and the criteria set out in the Guidelines were taken into account and applied.
