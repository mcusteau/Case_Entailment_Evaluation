The liability to pay interest arises by virtue of ss. 161(1) of the Act with regard to the amount of taxes remaining unpaid at the time such taxes are payable. The amount of interest is computed with respect to the unpaid remainder of taxes from the date such taxes are payable until the actual date of payment.
