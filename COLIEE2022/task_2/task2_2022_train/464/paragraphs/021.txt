Perhaps the most instructive provision, concerning the intent of the
Citizenship Act
as it relates to a standard of review, is Par­liament's decision to empower citizenship judges with the duty to determine whether the citizenship requirements have been met. Where this determination is made favour­ably, and absent an appeal, the Minister
shall
grant citizenship pursuant to s. 5. In
Southam Inc.
, Justice Iacobucci suggests that Parliament's delegation of the initial assessment to an administrative tribunal may in itself be an indicia that a standard other than correctness is called for:
"Presumably if Parliament entrusts a cer­tain matter to a tribunal and not (initially at least) to the courts, it is because the tribunal enjoys some advantage that judges do not. For that reason alone, review of the decision of a tribunal should often be on a standard more deferential than correctness." [see footnote 25]
