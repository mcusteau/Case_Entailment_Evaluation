The Governor-in-Council may appoint any citizen to be a citizenship judge. [see footnote 22] In the absence of any other provision in the
Act
, the citizenship judge is deemed to have been appointed to hold office during pleasure only. [see footnote 23] The Governor-in-Council has the same broad latitude to appoint members of the Im­migration and Refugee Board who, however, serve during good behaviour for a term not exceeding seven years. [see footnote 24] There is no evidence before me concerning any screening process which may exist prior to the appointment by the Governor-in-Coun­cil of a citizenship judge or a member of the Immigration and Refugee Board.
