While a citizenship judge may not have the professional expertise of the judges and lay members of the Competition Tribunal, the determination of whether the applicant for citizenship has met the residency re­quirement is substantially less complicated than the issues which were in play in Southam Inc. The hearing before the citizen­ship judge is far less protracted than the forty day proceeding before the Competition Tribunal in
Southam Inc.
The repeated exposure to a straightforward and narrow issue, such as the residency requirement, may also lead to the special experience and knowledge noted in the trademark cases, supra, paragraph 23. The specialization, and perhaps the expertise, of a citizenship judge may be more analogous with that of a non-lawyer member of the Refugee Division or decision maker in a trademark application. It is also relevant that the residency issue to be resolved by the citizenship judge is less complicated than those addressed by tri­bunals with relatively comparable expertise.
