In this case, the Citizenship judge does not appear to have focussed on the cirÂ­cumstances of the applicant's presence in Canada, prior to her joining her husband in China in February 1996. During this time, she remained within Canada except for one short vacation, she married and continued to live in Canada with her husband and was gainfully employed here. These are strong indicia of her having centralized her mode of living in Canada. Since joining her husband on his assignment for Greenpeace Canada, she has returned to Vancouver in June 1996 to settle legal matters concerning their new residence, and, with her husband, to celebrate the holiday season with his family in December 1997 and to attend her father-in-law's swearing in ceremony as a Canadian citizen in July 1997.
