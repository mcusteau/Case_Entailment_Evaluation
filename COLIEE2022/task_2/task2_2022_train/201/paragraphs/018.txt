 [18] 
  Subsection 72(2)( 
 a 
 ) of the IRPA does not apply in this case. The applicant's argument before the Court today is not that Viasna is, in fact, a member of the family class. The applicant submits that the officer's decision, considered as a whole, was unreasonable; the officer arbitrarily disregarded the reasonable and compassionate grounds by basing his refusal on the fact that the applicant abandoned her son because he had a visual handicap and that he was raised by his grandmother since 1996.
