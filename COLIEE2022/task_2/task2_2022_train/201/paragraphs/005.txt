  In his memorandum filed on February 24, 2010, the respondent submits that there is no substantial ground on which this Court could intervene, while opposing the application for leave and an extension of time. In particular, the respondent argues that the applicant cannot rely on ignorance of the law to obtain an extension of time, that the right of appeal to the IAD has not been exhausted and that, although the officer's refusal to grant Viasna permanent residence under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA is subject to judicial review, that application can only be brought by Viasna himself. On March 4, 2010, the applicant attempted to correct the situation and filed a written motion to the Court asking that Viasna's name be added in the style of cause as the co-applicant. However, on April 9, 2010, the Prothonotary of the Court before whom the motion to amend was brought decided on his own initiative to not consider it, but instead to adjourn it. According to the adjournment order, the motion to amend will become moot if the judge dealing with the application for leave and extension of time dismisses the latter at this stage.
