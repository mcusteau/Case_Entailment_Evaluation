  The wording of subsection 18.1(1) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
  is broad and leaves the door open to a wide variety of persons. The applicant's status as Viasna's mother/sponsor justifies granting this status in this case. Also, taking into consideration the wording and the purpose of subsection 18.1(1) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , it seems clear to me that the applicant falls into the category of "anyone directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought", especially since the respondent took no steps to have the applicant's name struck in this proceeding, which is at a very advanced stage.
