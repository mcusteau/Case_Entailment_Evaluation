  The applicant is Cambodian. She arrived in Canada in 2004 as a refugee and became a permanent resident in 2006. When she arrived in Canada, she declared two children as dependants and subsequently sponsored them. However, she did not mention her first child, Viasna. He was born out of wedlock on January 15, 1991. In the Cambodian culture, there was still significant shame associated with illegitimacy; the applicant had to leave Viasna with his maternal grandmother and severed all contact with her family. In fact, Viasna lived with his grandmother until 2006; at that point, she arrived in Canada, sponsored by the applicant's sister, without the applicant's knowledge. In turn, the grandmother attempted to sponsor Viasna in 2007, but the application for residence was rejected because she had not formally adopted Viasna. He has been living with his uncle in Cambodia since 2006.
