 [7] 
  On October 4, 2010, after hearing counsel, Justice Pinard found that the applicant had a continuing intention to pursue her application for judicial review, that the application for judicial review deserved consideration, that there was a reasonable explanation for the delay and that the extension of time would not prejudice the respondent ( 
 Huot 
 , above, at paragraphs 13 to 19). In doing so, he granted the application for an extension of time and adjourned the hearing of the application for judicial review to a later date to be determined by the Judicial Administrator of the Court. At the same time, in a separate order dated October 4, 2010, he dismissed the motion to amend because it was not supported by an affidavit of Viasna himself. On October 20, 2010, on the express direction of the Chief Justice of the Court, the hearing of this matter was set for December 1, 2010.
