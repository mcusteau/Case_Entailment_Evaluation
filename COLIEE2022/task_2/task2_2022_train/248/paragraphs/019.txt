Does s. 82.1(10) deprive the applicant of her life, liberty or security of the person? The applicant submits that the right to freedom of movement is akin to the right to liberty. She claims that the impairment of her right to come to Canada has infringed her right to liberty. Furthermore, the stigma attaching to the allegation of being in a triad and the damage to her reputation has caused the applicant psychological stress and has impaired her security of the person.
