[24]
In the context of s. 82.1(10), the secret information is carefully reviewed by a judge of this court and he or she must consider whether the information could be revealed to the person concerned. While the applicant does not get a summary of the confidential evidence, as in the case of a certificate filed under s. 40.1 of the
Immigration Act
, she is told why she is being denied admission to Canada. The applicant was told that the visa officer considered her a member of an inadmissable class, under s. 19(1)(c.2) of the
Immigration Act
, and that he had reasonable grounds to believe that she was a member of the Sun Yee On triad. There is nothing which prevents the applicant from seeking judicial review of the visa officer's decision and of leading affidavit evidence to show that she is not a member of the triad. Again, I accept that this is not "perfect justice", but when disclosure could be injurious to national security or to the safety of persons, the applicant's rights must be balanced against the state's legitimate interests.
