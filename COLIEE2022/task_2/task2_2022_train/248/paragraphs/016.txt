. The impugned subsection states:
"82.1(10) With respect to any application for judicial review of a decision by a visa officer to refuse to issue a visa to a person on the grounds that the person is a person described in any of paragraphs 19(1)(c.1) to (g), (k) and (l),
(a) the Minister may make an application to the Federal Court - Trial Division, in camera, and in the absence of the person and any counsel representing the person, for the nondisclosure to the person of information obtained in confidence from the government or an institution of a foreign state or from an international organization of states or an institution thereof;
(b) the court shall, in camera, and in the absence of the person and any counsel representing the person,
(i) examine the information, and
(ii) provide counsel representing the Minister with a reasonable opportunity to be heard as to whether the information should not be disclosed to the person on the grounds that the disclosure would be injurious to national security or to the safety of persons;
(c) the information shall be returned to counsel representing the Minister and shall not be considered by the court in making its determination on the judicial review if, in the opinion of the court, the disclosure of the information to the person would not be injurious to national security or to the safety of persons; and
(d) if the court determines that the information should not be disclosed to the person on the grounds that the disclosure would be injurious to national security or to the safety of persons, the information shall not be disclosed but may be considered by the court in making its determination."
