The applicant and the respondent submitted questions for certification and I have decided that the following questions should be certified:
1. Does s. 82.1(10) of the
Immigration Act
infringe s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and, if so, is the infringement demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, pursuant to s. 1 of the
Charter
?
2. Does s. 82.1(10) of the
Immigration Act
infringe s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
?
3. Can a visa officer revoke permanent resident visas, once they have been issued, or is the visa officer "functus officio"?
Application dismissed.
