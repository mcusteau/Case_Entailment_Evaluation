  The Estate alleges that the decision under review was unreasonable and procedurally unfair in the way that the processing delays, Mrs. Dort's mental distress and the amount in issue were treated or not treated, taking into account the Dorts' overall compliance with tax legislation over the years. Furthermore, Mr. Gibson's decision is fatally defective as regards the request that delays in processing be taken into account because he was to review a first level decision. In fact, and in law, it is alleged that there was no first decision on that point.
