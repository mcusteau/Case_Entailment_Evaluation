  Mr. Gibson rightly held that Mrs. Dort as the executrix of the Estate was responsible for ensuring the debt was paid in full from the proceeds of the Estate. The Estate had ample assets. Interest was allowed to accumulate because Mr. Dort gambled that the test case would be successful. When Mrs. Dort later paid the principal amount of the debt, she could also have paid the accrued interest. She never asked for a repayment schedule.
