 Harrington, J. 
 : In this case, the Minister of National Revenue was asked to exercise his discretion by waiving interest owed on an income tax debt. Section 220(3.1) of the Income Tax Act allows him to do this. It provides: 
 
 
 
 The Minister may at any time waive or cancel all or any portion of any penalty or interest otherwise payable under this Act by a taxpayer or partnership and, notwithstanding subsections 152(4) to 152(5), such assessment of the interest and penalties payable by the taxpayer or partnership shall be made as is necessary to take into account the cancellation of the penalty or interest.
