  Paragraph 5(d) of Guidelines IC-92-2 provides: 
 
 
 
 5. Penalties and interest may be waived or cancelled in whole or in part where they result in circumstances beyond a taxpayer's or employer's control. For example, one of the following extraordinary circumstances may have prevented a taxpayer, a taxpayer's agent, the executor of an estate, or an employer from making a payment when due, or otherwise complying with the Income Tax Act: 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 (d) serious emotional or mental distress such as, death in the immediate family. 
 
 
 
 On this point, Mr. Gibson's decision was in review of J.F. Lee's decision. He found that there was no evidence that Mrs. Dort's natural distress upon the death of her husband prevented her from dealing with the Estate's financial matters. She had demonstrated an ability to attend to complex financial matters. Mr. Gibson's decision is not reviewable.
