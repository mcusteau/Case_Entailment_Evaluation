  In accordance with the decisions of the Supreme Court in Dr. Q. v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226 and Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, the judicial review of decisions of administrative tribunals must be approached functionally and pragmatically. Depending on the circumstances, the applicable standard of review is correctness, unreasonableness or patent unreasonableness. In Lanno v. Canada (Customs and Revenue Agency), 2005 FCA 153, [2005] F.C.J. No. 714 (QL), the Federal Court of Appeal overruled the trial judge who had applied the standard of patent unreasonableness, and held that the appropriate standard was reasonableness. The decision under review in that case was a decision of a tax official not to exercise his discretion under section 152(4.2) of the Act so as to permit the reassessment of Mr. Lanno's returns beyond the normal reassessment period, which reassessment would have resulted in a refund. That section, like the section in question in this case, section 220(3.1), was part of the Fairness Package which was introduced in 1991. Mrs. Dort submitted that a discretionary decision with respect to the waiver of interest is likewise subject to a reasonableness standard of review. That submission is correct. The Federal Court of Appeal has just recently specifically extended Lanno, supra, to section 220(3.1) of the Income Tax Act (Comeau c. Agence des douanes et du Revenue du Canada, 2005 CAF 271).
