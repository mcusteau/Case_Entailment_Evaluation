On December 4, 1991, the applicant was sentenced to three years' and two months' imprisonment for offences of breaking, entering and committing a sexual assault, forcible confinement and failure to comply with the terms of a recognizance. The sexual assault was an unprovoked attack on an innocent victim who was sleeping late at night in the privacy of her home. Approximately ten months later, on October 20, 1992, the applicant began day parole at a community residential centre in Hamilton, Ontario. On April 19, 1993, the Board terminated the day parole of the applicant after receiving information that the police were investigating him as a suspect in a number of sexual assaults. On September 10, 1993, the applicant was charged with offences of breaking and entering, sexual assault with a weapon, sexual assault causing bodily harm, forcible confinement, theft and possession of stolen property over $1,000, all relating to an incident which allegedly occurred in 1984. He was denied bail on these charges. The police continued to investigate the applicant for a number of similar offences alleged to have occurred during his day parole in 1993.
