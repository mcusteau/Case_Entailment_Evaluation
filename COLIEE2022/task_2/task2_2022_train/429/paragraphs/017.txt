In the present case, the applicant was entitled by virtue of s. 140(1) of the
Act
to have his review conducted by way of a hearing, as his file had been referred to the Board under s. 129(2)(a)(ii) of the
Act
. However, following the rejection by the Board of the preliminary objections raised at the outset of the hearing by his legal assistant, the applicant "refused to attorn to the jurisdiction of the Board". In doing so, the applicant refused to attend the hearing within the meaning of s. 140(1) of the
Act
, thereby enabling the Board to determine his case by a review of the materials on file. In the circumstances, the Board did not conduct the review of the case of the applicant by way of a hearing within the meaning of s. 143(1) of the
Act
and it had no obligation to maintain a record of the proceedings. The failure of the Board to provide the applicant with a transcript of the proceedings is therefore of no consequence whatsoever in the circumstances of this case. I note in passing that the Board recorded its decision in writing following its review of the case of the applicant, thereby complying with s. 143(2) of the
Act
.
