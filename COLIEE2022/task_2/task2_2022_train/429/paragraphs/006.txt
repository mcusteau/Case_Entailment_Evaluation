The applicant refused to participate in the psychiatric assessment. As a result, the psychiatrist, who was the Chairman of the Division of Forensic and Correctional Psychiatry at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, made his assessment based on the file material and a brief conversation which he had with the case management officer of the applicant. The psychiatrist noted in his report that the sexual assault which led to the conviction and incarceration of the applicant implied "... premeditation and planning and a previous similar act or at least fantasy rehearsal of such an act". Furthermore, he observed that the attendance of the applicant at a sex offender program during his day parole in Hamilton had resulted in "... unsatisfactory therapeutic progress and the therapist expressed little surprise that he was charged with further sexual offences". Although the psychiatrist expressed reluctance to make a diagnosis in the absence of a personal interview with the applicant, he interpreted the reports of the Hamilton therapist as suggesting the possibility of psychopathy. He concluded that
"the overall picture presented from the file information, especially that obtained more recently and which is considered sensitive, is of an individual with well concealed sexual pathology that would make him a high risk to reoffend sexually ... At the present time, for lack of more detailed information and the fact that he now faces charges and is under continuing police investigation, it is difficult to make a satisfactory assessment of his risk. However, given all the available information, I think it very likely that Mr. Giroux could commit further aggressive sexual offences were he to be released at his statutory released (sic) date."
