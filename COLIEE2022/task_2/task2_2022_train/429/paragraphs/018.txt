Alternatively, even if I am wrong in concluding that the Board did not conduct the review of the case of the applicant by way of a hearing, I am nevertheless of the opinion that it did not breach the law or the rules of natural justice in failing to provide a transcript. Although the Board has adopted the prudent practice of tape recording its proceedings, s. 143(1) of the
Act
does not require it to do so. Indeed, the Board is only required by law to "... maintain a record of the proceedings ..." and, in the French version, it must "... tient un dossier des proc√©dures ...". In my opinion, both the English and the French versions of the
Act
fall short of imposing a statutory obligation on the Board to produce a verbatim recording of its proceedings. In the circumstances of this case, the detailed reasons for decision of the Board, which included the objections raised by the legal assistant and the ruling made by the Board, constitute a "... record of the proceedings ..." within the meaning of s. 143(1) of the
Act
. (See
