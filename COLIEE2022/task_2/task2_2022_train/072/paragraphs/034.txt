  Since the Board directed its attention to the degree of hardship associated with the Applicant's return to St. Vincent, it cannot be said to have erred in applying the appropriate test for H&C grounds. To the extent I have already found the Board to have erred, this was in relation to the treatment of important evidence in making the assessment rather than any incorrect statement of the test itself.
