  The material issue is therefore the prospects of the Applicant for receiving similar assistance in St. Vincent. Since this was a significant factor in the overall determination, it is unreasonable for the Officer to have erroneously focused on the Applicant's ability to work and then fail to conduct a thorough analysis of the nature and extent of benefits available to her. The Officer has not provided sufficient justification for its definitive conclusion that the Applicant "will have access to government assistance" should she be returned to St. Vincent and unable to work. This particular finding was not reasonable.
