In her letter of August 1997, a person responsible for human resources in the Greenpeace office in Toronto described the assignment of the applicant's husband in China in these terms:
"Because of Mr. Lam's experience and training with Greenpeace Canada and his understanding of the language and culture in China, we have seconded Mr. Lam to assist the Greenpeace International China Project, which is mandated to establish the offices and activities of our newest office, Greenpeace China, in Hong Kong. The project coordinator is fellow Canadian, Anne Dingwall. Mr. Lam's presence will be essential to the success of the Project.
"In order to perform his services, Mr. Lam is required, on behalf of our organisation, to make a number of overseas trips to Hong Kong and China over the next two years, and will be stationed abroad for extended periods. We understand that Mr. Lam's wife Kit May Phoebe Lam will also be accompanying him during his stays abroad."
This letter sets out the temporary nature of Mr. Lam's assignment in China and the desire of his spouse to be with him during this period.
