Justice and fairness, both for the citizenship applicants and the Minister, require some continuity with respect to the standard of review while the current
Act
is still in force and despite the end of the de novo trials. The appropriate standard, in these circumstances, is one close to the correctness end of the spectrum. However, where citizenship judges, in clear reasons which demonstrate an understanding of the case law, properly decide that the facts satisfy their view of the statutory test in paragraph 5(1)(c), the reviewing judges ought not to substitute arbitrarily their dif­ferent opinion of the residency requirement. It is to this extent that some deference is owed to the special knowledge and ex­perience of the citizenship judge during this period of transition.
