The applicant for citizenship, a per­manent resident who is eighteen years of age or over, must meet the residency, language and knowledge of Canada requirements set out in paragraphs 5(1)(c), (d) and (e). Ac­cording to s. 14(1), the application is con­sidered by a citizenship judge who deter­mines whether the requirements have been met. Where the application is approved, the Minister
shall
issue the certificate of citizen­ship, pursuant to s. 12(2). Sections 14(5) and 14(6) create the right of appeal from the decision of the citizenship judge to the Federal Court - Trial Division, [see footnote 2] whose judgment is not subject to further appeal. [see footnote 3] The Governor-in-Council, under s. 26(1), may appoint any Canadian citizen to be a citizenship judge.
