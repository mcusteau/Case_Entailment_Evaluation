The relevant portions of the letter of decision of the Citizenship judge state:
"Federal Court precedents require that to establish residence, an individual must show in mind and in fact, a centralization of his or her mode of living in Canada. If such residence is established, absences from Canada do not affect this residence, as long as it is demonstrated that the in­dividual left for a temporary purpose only and always maintained in Canada some real and tangible form of residence. I have, therefore, carefully examined your case to determine whether you had established residence in Canada prior to your absences such that those absences could nevertheless be counted as periods of residence.
"Until the date of an application for citizenship on July 21, 1997 you were absent for approximately 482 days leaving you short 474 days of the required 1095 days. A review of the facts of your case and the relevant case law has led me to conclude that you did not maintain suf­ficient ties with Canada during your ab­sences to have those substantive absences count as periods of residence under the [A]ct."
In considering the appeal from this decision, an analysis of the applicable standard of review is in order.
