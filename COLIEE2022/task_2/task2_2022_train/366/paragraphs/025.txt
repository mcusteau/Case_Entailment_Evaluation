As I understand Justice Iacobucci's comments in
Southam Inc.
, he recognized that the standard of review may vary: "De足pending on how the factors play out in a particular instance, the standard may fall somewhere between correctness, at the more exacting end of the spectrum, and patently unreasonable, at the more deferential end." [see footnote 35] In concluding that a third standard should be whether the decision of the tribunal is unreasonable, he added this caution:
"... a reviewer, and even one who has embarked upon review on a standard of reasonableness 'simpliciter', will often be tempted to find some way to intervene when the reviewer him- or herself would have come to a conclusion opposite to the tribunal's. Appellate courts must resist such temptations. My statement that I might not have come to the same con足clusion as the Tribunal should not be taken as an invitation to appellate courts to inter足vene in cases such as this one but rather as a caution against such intervention and a call for restraint. Judicial restraint is needed if a cohesive, rational, and, I be足lieve, sensible system of judicial review is to be fashioned." [see footnote 36]
