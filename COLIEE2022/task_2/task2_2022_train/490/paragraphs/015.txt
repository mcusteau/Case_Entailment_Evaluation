In the case at bar the plaintiffs lost their right to return to Cameroon when they left with forged documents, thereby failing to comply with s. 29 of the Cameroon relevant legislation. If they had tried to return to Cameroon at once, they would have been denied entry under s. 32 of the said law. This means that the plaintiffs did not have the right to return to Cameroon when they appeared at the point of entry to Canada. However, they lost their status in Cameroon through their own fault. They alleged that they used forged documents because of fear of the Cameroon authorities. The IRB found that in view of the evidence before it such a fear was not reasonable.
