The panel did render two decisions, making a distinction between the claims of the plaintiff and Astrid and that of Cédric. It is also true that it was not until the hearing was underway that Cédric's Belgian nationality became known, as the result of new retroactive legislation introduced in Belgium. However, the IRB erred by failing to appoint an independent counsel for Cédric, as required by s. 69(4) of the
Act
and by s. 15 of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
. By not giving Cédric an opportunity to be heard, the panel also infringed the audi alteram partem rule (
Maricic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2002), 219 F.T.R. 229; 2002 FCT 510 (T.D.)). This denial of procedural fairness in my opinion suffices to vitiate the IRB's decision. In
Cardinal and Oswald v. Kent Institution (Director)
, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643; 63 N.R. 353, at 661, the Supreme Court of Canada said:
"If this be a correct view of the implications of the approach of the majority of the British Columbia Court of Appeal to the issue of procedural fairness in this case, I find it necessary to affirm that
the denial of a right to a fair hearing must always render a decision invalid, whether or not it may appear to a reviewing court that the hearing would likely have resulted in a different decision
. The right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent, unqualified right which finds its essential justification in the sense of procedural justice which any person affected by an administrative decision is entitled to have. It is not for a court to deny that right and sense of justice on the basis of speculation as to what the result might have been had there been a hearing." (My emphasis.)
