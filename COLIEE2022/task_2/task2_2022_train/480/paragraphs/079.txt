The issue now is to determine if an order in the nature of quo warranto should issue in the circumstances of this case. Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, set out the following rules in regards to the issuance of a writ of quo warranto:
"According to de Smith's
Judicial Review of Administrative Action
(4th Ed. by J.M. Evans, 1980), the old substantive law rules for quo warranto, with only slight modifications, still apply, as listed below (at pp. 463-464):
1. The office must be one of a public nature.
2. The holder must have already exercised the office; a mere claim to exercise it is not enough.
3. The office must have been created by the Crown, by a Royal Charter, or by an Act of Parliament.
4. The office must not be that of a deputy or servant who can be dismissed at will.
5. A plaintiff will be barred from a remedy if the plaintif [sic] has been guilty of acquiescence in the usurpation of office or undue delay.
6. The plaintiff must have a genuine interest in the proceedings. Nowadays probably any member of the public will have sufficient interest, provided that he has no private interest to serve.
"The following matters are within the discretion of the court (Dussault and Borgeat,
Administrative Law: A Treatise
, 1990, p. 388):
7. Standing of the applicant.
8. The reasonableness of the length of time elapsed since the election.
9. The appropriateness of requiring that all internal relief avenues be first exhausted.
"The following are some additional factors to be considered in a discussion of the remedy of quo warranto:
10. Whether the onus is on the applicant or the respondent to prove his case.
11. Whether the remedy of quo warranto may be granted independent of any other remedy." (
Jock
, supra, at pp. 370-371.)
The above factors must now be applied to the facts of the case at bar.
