Following the election, on March 18, 1994, the applicant appealed the election of the respondent Hall, pursuant to s. 15.1 of the
Code
, on the basis that he had not met the residency requirement set out in the
Code
and
Regulations
. [see footnote 10] Section 7 of the
Code
requires candidates for Band Council to have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months prior to the election. Section 16(4) of the
Regulations
provides for an interpretation of the words "resided on the Reserve" in the
Code
. [see footnote 11] An Election Appeals Board was established pursuant to the provisions of the
Code
, and on or about March 26, 1994, the Board ordered that a new general election be held. Pursuant to s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
, only the Itancan, defined as the Chief and Council, is empowered to call an election. However, the respondent Hall has refused to step down as Chief and the respondent Band Council has refused to call a new election.
