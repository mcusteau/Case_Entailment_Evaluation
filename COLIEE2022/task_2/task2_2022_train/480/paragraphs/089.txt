[89]
In full awareness that the respondent Hall, the applicant's sole competition for the office of Chief, did not meet the residency requirement of the
Code
and
Regulations
, the applicant accepted his own nomination for the office of Chief and participated in the election which followed. The applicant allowed his office as Band Chief, which he had held for the previous eight years, to be contested by a candidate he believed was not even eligible to run. However, the applicant did not draw this to the attention of the electoral officer. Rather, he let the tainted process continue. It was only once the election results were known that the applicant publicly disputed the respondent Hall's eligibility to hold office. I am of the view that in light of these circumstances, it can fairly be said the applicant acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent Hall.
