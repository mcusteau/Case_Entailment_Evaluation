The respondents' position is that the March 14, 1994, election was held in accordance with Band custom. However, the Band's custom was not reflected in the
Code
. Rather, the respondents submitted that the Band Council was elected in accordance with the unwritten custom of the Band. If that proposition is accepted, then I am of the view that such a circumstance in fact supports the applicant's submission that the
Code
reflects the Band's custom. That is, if one accepts that the election proceeded in a manner consistent with the Band's unwritten custom, then since this unwritten custom mirrored the alleged written custom (the
Code
), it follows that the
Code
sets out in writing the custom of the Band. I am of the view that if one accepts the first proposition, it is also necessary to accept the second proposition, namely, that the
Code
reflects the Band's custom.
