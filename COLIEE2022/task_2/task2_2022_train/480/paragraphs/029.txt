The respondents submitted that it is the Band that has the power to determine what the constitution, or electoral procedures, of the Band are, and that this power must be exercised in accordance with s. 2(3)(a), as set out, supra. I agree that it is the Band itself, not the Band Council, that has the power to determine what constitutes the Band's custom. However, I disagree with the respondents' submission that this is a "power conferred on a band" as is contemplated by s. 2(3)(a) of the
Indian Act
