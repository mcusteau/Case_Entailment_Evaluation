The applicant made two submissions. Firstly, the applicant submitted that with respect to the remedy of quo warranto, it is apparent from the Federal Court decision in
Jock v. Canada
, [1991] 2 F.C. 355; 41 F.T.R. 189 (T.D.) [hereinafter
Jock
], that the 30 day limitation period is inapplicable. The
Jock
decision is a 1991 decision of this court that deals with facts similar to those in the case at bar. In
Jock
Justice Teitelbaum declined to make an order in the nature of quo warranto. The applicant submitted that there was no suggestion in the
Jock
decision that one would have to be concerned with the 30 day limitation in s. 18.1(2). Applicant's counsel thus submitted that quo warranto is available under s. 18, arguably independent of the constraints of s. 18.1.
