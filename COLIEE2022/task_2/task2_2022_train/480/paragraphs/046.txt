What is the significance of this noncompliance with the Department's policy? In my view, it has no effect on the validity of the Deputy Minister's order repealing the s. 74 order. A ministerial order is in the discretion of the Minister: this policy was merely directory, not mandatory. However, I do think it weakens the weight to be accorded the inference that the Department's requirements were satisfied and thus there was evidence of Band membership support of the electoral system to be employed following revocation of the s. 74 order.
