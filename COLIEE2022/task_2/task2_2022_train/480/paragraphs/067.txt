Firstly, although it is the
Code
that contains the residency requirement in relation to a candidate for the office of Band Chief, it is the
Regulations
that contain the stringent definition of the words "resided on the Reserve". The respondent Hall has conceded that if the
Regulations
are found to be valid, that he does not meet the residency requirement, as it is defined in the
Regulations
. [see footnote 29] However, the respondent Hall further submitted that if the court determined that the
Code
was valid, but the
Regulations
were invalid, then he maintained his position that he
does
meet the residency requirement, as articulated in the
Code
alone.
