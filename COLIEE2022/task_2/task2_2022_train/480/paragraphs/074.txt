It must therefore be determined whether the respondent Hall is disentitled from holding office by virtue of the residency requirement as set out in the
Code
. Section 7 of the
Code
reads as follows:
"7. Dakota Oyate members who are 18 years of age or over, and have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months prior to the election date may run for Chief and Councillor."
Therefore, if the respondent Hall did not reside on the Reserve for the 12 months prior to the election date, that is during the period of March 14, 1993, to March 14, 1994, then he was not eligible to run for Chief. Unfortunately, the
Code
itself does not provide an interpretation of the words "resided on the Reserve": that interpretation was included in the
Regulations
, which I have concluded are invalid. Accordingly, s. 7 of the
Code
must be interpreted without the assistance of a definition.
