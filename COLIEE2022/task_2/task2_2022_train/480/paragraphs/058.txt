Accordingly, in my view the respondents' find themselves in a difficult position. They have conceded that the
Indian Act
no longer governs the Band Council elections, and they have attacked the validity of the
Code
. As a result, they have taken the position that the legal basis for their election may be found in the unwritten custom of the Band, which they submit the election complied with. There are two difficulties with this argument. The first difficulty is the one referred to supra: if the election was consistent with the
Code
and was also consistent with the unwritten custom, then the
Code
and custom must be one and the same.
