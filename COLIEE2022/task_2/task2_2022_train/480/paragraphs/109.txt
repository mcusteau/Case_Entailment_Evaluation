The aggregate result of the above determinations is as follows. The Band Council finds its legal basis for holding office in the
Code
. The next Band Council election, which by my calculation is due to occur within the next couple of months, may proceed in accordance with the
Code
. If the Band membership is dissatisfied with the present state of the
Code
, s. 22 of the
Code
embodies an amending provision. Although the
Regulations
have been declared invalid, there is nothing preventing the present Band Council from developing valid regulations and submitting them to the community for approval.
