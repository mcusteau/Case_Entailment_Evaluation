It is not disputed that on August 31, 1992, House No. 3700, which is located on the Reserve, was transferred from Louise Hall, the respondent Hall's sister, to the respondent Hall. [see footnote 33] However, it is also not disputed that prior to August 31, 1992, and at least until May 31, 1993, the respondent Hall also held title to a residential property located at 12 Beech Boulevard, in Brandon, Manitoba, which was not on the Reserve. [see footnote 34] The respondent Hall stated, under oath, during cross-examination upon his affidavit that sometime in October of 1992 he moved some furniture into House 3700, in November of 1992 he began eating lunch in House 3700 occasionally, and in April or May of 1993 he began sleeping in House 3700 occasionally on weekends, as he had began renovations. Prior to this he had continued to sleep at his residence in Brandon. The respondent Hall further stated that he had three school-aged children, who attended school in Brandon during the school term of September, 1992 to June, 1993. None of the children ever slept at House 3700 until April or May of 1993. It was not until the later part of May, 1993, that he began sleeping exclusively at House 3700. [see footnote 35]
