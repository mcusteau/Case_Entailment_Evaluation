[34]
The applicant provided evidence to support his submission that the
Code
received Band approval. As was discussed above, it is not disputed that the ministerial order that brought the Band Council elections under the governance of the
Indian Act
, was revoked in February of 1994. Attached as an exhibit to the Affidavit of Robert Bone, filed on behalf of the applicant, is a copy of the policy and procedures to be followed by the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs, for the purpose of recommending to the Minister that an order pursuant to s. 74 be repealed. Paragraph 2 of the policy states:
"Where a band wishes to have a s. 74 order repealed, the department must ensure that the band has, or will have, a system in place which is supported by the band membership and which protects the rights of the individual band members."
The policy further states that evidence of band membership support may be obtained at a public band meeting, by petition, by plebiscite or by other means within the custom of the Band.
