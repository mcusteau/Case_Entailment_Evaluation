, the Court held that a hearing had been unfairly conducted where the applicant's counsel had consented to the RPO questioning first, to be followed by the RPD member. The applicants rely on paragraph 4 of the reasons which reads as follows:
"As argued by Counsel for the Applicant in the present application, a serious due process issue exists as to whether there was a fair hearing before the RPD. At the hearing, the Applicant was not allowed to lead his evidence, but instead, the Refugee Protection Officer was instructed to question first, and then, the RPD followed with what I find is accurately described by Counsel for the Applicant as 'badgering' cross-examination"
