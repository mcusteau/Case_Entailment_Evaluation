That is not to say that fettering could not be made out in a particular case. As held in
So v. Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (Ont.)
(1995), 82 O.A.C. 43; 24 O.R.(3d) 530 (Div. Ct.), the application of a policy guideline may amount to an unlawful fettering of a Board's discretion, if applied without due consideration to the evidence and submissions in a particular case. Such a situation may arise where a member decides to apply the Guideline without exception and ignores the evidence or submissions of counsel that there is reason to vary the procedure.
Is Guideline 7 beyond the scope of the Chairperson's authority?
