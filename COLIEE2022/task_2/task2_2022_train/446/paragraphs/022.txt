In paragraph 19 of Guideline 7, found at Exhibit "I" to the second Aterman affidavit, RPD members and others are advised:
"In a claim for refugee protection, the
standard practice
will be for the [Refugee Protection Officer] RPO to start questioning the claimant. If there is no RPO participating in the hearing, the member
will
begin, followed by counsel for the claimant." (Emphasis added)
