I accept that counsel, generally, have spent considerable time with the claimants prior to the hearings, have gained their trust and know the evidence to be adduced and the claimants' frailties. Many claimants will have been traumatized from their past experiences, as was indicated by Dr. Payne in his evidence. Should the RPO or the Board member, strangers to the claimants, question first, the claimants may be exposed to unnecessary stress that may make it difficult for them to be properly heard.
