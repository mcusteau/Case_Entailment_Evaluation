The applicants submit that while a Board member can and should ask questions to clarify matters that arise in the course of a hearing, it is not appropriate for the member to take on the role of counsel or the RPO and conduct an examination and/or cross-examination of a refugee claimant. The member should remain out of the arena in order to impartially assess the evidence presented in the course of the hearing and intervene only when necessary to clarify or gather evidence necessary to the determination if that evidence has not been elicited by counsel or the RPO. Guideline 7, it is submitted, impedes the adjudicative role of the member and this further contributes to the denial of procedural fairness.
