These provisions indicate to me, a legislative intention to avoid the formalities which are attendant upon court hearings in civil or criminal proceedings. This legislative intention is not inconsistent with the requirements of fundamental justice. I note that the Supreme Court has cautioned against extending the procedural rights provided by the
Charter
for criminal cases to administrative law cases:

, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307; 260 N.R. 1; 141 B.C.A.C. 161; 231 W.A.C. 161; 2000 SCC 44, at para. 88.
