Section 162(2) provides that "[e]ach Division shall deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit". While s. 170 states that the RPD must give the claimant and the Minister a reasonable opportunity to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations, the procedure is not bound by "legal or technical rules of evidence".
