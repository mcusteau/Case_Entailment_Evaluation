, above, at paragraphs 51-57, the Federal Court of Appeal noted three considerations of particular relevance to the question of bias in the context of RPD decision making.

Secondly, that the Board has a particularly difficult mandate of administrative adjudication. And third, that the notion of bias connotes circumstances giving rise to a reasonable and informed belief that the decision maker has been influenced by some extraneous or improper considerations.
