  The Officer made three critical findings which are central to this judicial review: 
 
 
 
 (a) that the Applicants' prolonged stay in Canada was within their control; 
 
 
 
 (b) that, based on the Officer's own research (copies of which were not provided to the Applicants), the youngest son's eczema was treatable in India; and 
 
 
 
 (c) that in considering the best interests of the children, they would not suffer unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship if returned to India.
