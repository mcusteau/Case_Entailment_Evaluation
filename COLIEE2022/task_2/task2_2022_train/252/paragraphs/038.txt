I am not convinced by the Ministers' arguments on this point. Mr. Zündel's past behaviour shows that so far he has respected whatever conditions have been imposed, and his opinions of the various judicial systems are not at issue. I am uncertain of the significance of the fact that he did not comply with the American requirements for visa renewal. It is difficult for me to understand why Mr. Zündel would deliberately sabotage his own endeavour to become a permanent resident of the United States, where his wife resides and where the Zundelsite is not subject to any regulations as is the case in Canada. If Mr. Zündel had meant to escape the consequences of his actions or omissions, he would not have remained at home, where the American authorities had no trouble finding him. On the face of it, his explanations of a misunderstanding would appear more convincing than some devious plan to avoid visa compliance requirements.
