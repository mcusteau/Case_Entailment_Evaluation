, [2002] F.C.J. No. 352; 223 F.T.R. 233 (T.D.), at para. 57: "Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are". Mr. Zündel states that this kind of reasoning is to make him "guilty by association". I agree that one must be careful to not confuse acquaintance and complicity. But once again, the test here is one of reasonable belief, and I believe the test has been met. In fact, surpassed. Mr. Zündel represents a threat that far exceeds simple guilt by association.
