[26]
In several decisions (
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Singh
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1147 (T.D.);
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Mahjoub
, [2001] 4 F.C. 644; 212 F.T.R. 42 (T.D.);
Ikhlef, Re
, [2002] F.C.J. No. 352; 223 F.T.R. 233 (T.D.);
Jaballah, Re
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 822; 234 F.T.R. 26 (T.D.)), this Court came to the conclusion that the person named in the certificate had in fact much closer contacts with various senior operatives of terrorist organizations than he had admitted. In each case, the respondent would state not knowing, or knowing very vaguely, persons that were known terrorists or known senior members of terrorist organizations. There comes a point where one must wonder why someone who knows a person only vaguely would be called or consulted. It strains credulity to think that when in the presence of persons known to the authorities for violent and illegal activities, only mundane issues are discussed, never politics, never any actions or activities. In
Re Jaballah
, supra, for instance, Justice MacKay states, after reviewing both public and in camera evidence that Mr. Jaballah had, in fact, significant contact with terrorist groups,
"The inference drawn and now strengthened by the new information is one adverse to Mr. Jaballah, that
unless he was a senior AJ-Al Qaida operative, he could not have had contact with so many others who were senior members and active in those organizations
." (para. 85, emphasis added)
