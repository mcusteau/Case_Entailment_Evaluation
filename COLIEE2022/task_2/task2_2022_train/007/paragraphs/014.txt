  The respondent submitted that in any case where an inadmissibility provision is being applied, three issues may arise: (1) the officer's interpretation of paragraph 40(1)(a) is a question of law and the correctness standard applies, (2) the officer's assessment of the evidence of the misrepresentation is a question of fact and subject to a standard of patent unreasonableness, and (3) the officer's consideration of the facts against the legal criteria applicable is a question of mixed law and fact and the standard of reasonableness  
 simpliciter 
  applies. The respondent submitted that the issues in this application relate to the assessment of the evidence and whether the criteria for making an inadmissibility finding are met. The respondent submitted that insofar as the issues here turn on the meaning of paragraph 40(1)(a), those questions are subject to the correctness standard (
