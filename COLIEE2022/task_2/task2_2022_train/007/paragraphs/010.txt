 [10] 
  I would rephrase the issues as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. What is the appropriate standard of review? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the officer make a reviewable error in interpreting the paragraph 40(1)(a) to include situations where the applicant adopts a misrepresentation, but then clarifies it prior to a decision being rendered on the application? 
 
 
 
 3. If not, did the officer err in finding that paragraph 40(1)(a) applied to the facts in this case?
