  The applicant submitted that the officer erred in concluding that the applicant was inadmissible on grounds of misrepresentation. The applicant submitted that while paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Act is broadly written, it can only apply with respect to a misrepresentation that is not clarified by the applicant. The applicant submitted that there is no jurisprudence indicating that a person who makes a misrepresentation, but clarifies it prior to it being relied upon is inadmissible. A person is only inadmissible on the ground of not answering truthfully if the person continued to maintain the falsehood (see  
 Kang 
  v.  
 Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , 1981 FCJ 50). The applicant also submitted that the misrepresentation must continue until the time a decision is rendered.
