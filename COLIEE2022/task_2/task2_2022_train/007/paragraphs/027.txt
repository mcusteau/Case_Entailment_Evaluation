  I acknowledge that this case presents a unique situation as the misrepresentation was clarified before the decision was rendered. However, to adopt the applicant's interpretation would lead to a situation whereby individuals could knowingly make a misrepresentation, but not be found inadmissible under paragraph 40(1)(a) so long as they clarified the misrepresentation right before a decision was rendered. I agree with the respondent that such an interpretation could result in a situation whereby only misrepresentations "caught" by the visa officer during an interview would be clarified; therefore, leaving a high potential for abuse of the Act.
