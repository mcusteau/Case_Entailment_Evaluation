  The Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re) 
 , above at paragraphs 21 to 23 held: 
 
 
 
 Although much has been written about the interpretation of legislation (see, e.g., Ruth Sullivan,  
 Statutory Interpretation 
  (1997); Ruth Sullivan, Driedger on the  
 Construction of Statutes 
  (3rd ed. 1994) (hereinafter "Construction of Statutes"); Pierre-André Côté,  
 The Interpretation of Legislation in Canada 
  (2nd ed. 1991)), Elmer Driedger in  
 Construction of Statutes 
  (2nd ed. 1983) best encapsulates the approach upon which I prefer to rely. He recognizes that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on the wording of the legislation alone. At p. 87 he states: 
 
 
 
 Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament. 
 
 
 
 Recent cases which have cited the above passage with approval include:  
 R. 
  v.  
 Hydro-Québec 
 , 1997 CanLII 318 (S.C.C.), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 213;  
 Royal Bank of Canada 
  v.  
 Sparrow Electric Corp. 
 , 1997 CanLII 377 (S.C.C.), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 411;  
 Verdun 
  v.  
 Toronto-Dominion Bank 
 , 1996 CanLII 186 (S.C.C.), [1996] 3 S.C.R. 550;  
 Friesen 
  v.  
 Canada 
 , 1995 CanLII 62 (S.C.C.), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 103. 
 
 
 
 I also rely upon s. 10 of the  
 Interpretation Act 
 , R.S.O. 1980, c. 219, which provides that every Act "shall be deemed to be remedial" and directs that every Act shall "receive such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning and spirit".
