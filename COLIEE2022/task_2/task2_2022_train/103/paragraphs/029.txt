  The Respondent submits that a determination by the Board on an issue of foreign law is a finding of fact, and as such, is subject to deference by the Court on review. Referring to subsection 18.1(4) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, the Respondent asserts that the applicable standard of review is patent unreasonableness. In support of her position, the Respondent also refers to  
 Saini v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2001), 278 N.R. 127; 2001 FCA 311. In that case, the Federal Court of Appeal stated at paragraph 26 that: 
 
 
 
 "Foreign law is a question of fact, which must be proved to the satisfaction of the Court. Judicial findings about foreign law, therefore, have always been considered on appeal as questions of fact (see, J.-G. Castel, 
  Canadian Conflict of Laws 
 , 4th Ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1997), at page 155). Moreover, it is well settled that this Court will only interfere with a finding of fact, including a finding of fact with regard to expert evidence, if there has been a palpable and overriding error (see for example  
 N.V. Bocimar S.A. v. Century Insurance Co. of Canada 
 , [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1247;  
 Stein et al. v. 'Kathy K' et al. (The Ship) 
 , [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802)."
