  Justice Rouleau further found that the Respondent's status met the criteria adopted by the Court in  
 Shamlou v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1995] F.C.J. No. 1536; 103 F.T.R. 241 (T.D.), for determining whether the Respondent had the "rights and obligations" attached to the possession of nationality in Germany which would bring her within Article 1E. In  
 Shamlou 
 , the Court endorsed the following basic rights as associated with nationality: the right to return, the right to reside for an unlimited period of time, the right to study, the right to work, and access to basic social services. Justice Rouleau found that, by her own testimony, the Respondent established that she was able to work and study in Germany; that she was entitled to and received a small stipend from the government for her care; and that she was also able to leave and return to Germany, as she had done previously for a school field trip.
