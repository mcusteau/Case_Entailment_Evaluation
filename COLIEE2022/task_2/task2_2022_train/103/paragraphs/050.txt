  To accept such an argument would be to accept that permanent residency status in Germany can be determined solely on an individual's own subjective assessment at the time he or she leaves the country. The lack of an objective component in determining loss of residency status under German law makes such a test unworkable and in my view opens the door to jurisdiction shopping, the very consequence intended to be prevented by Article 1 E of the

 . Further, it is unreasonable, on the evidence before the Board, to accept that this is a proper interpretation of German law. In my view, the evidence before the Board supports a finding that the Respondent could have returned to Germany without difficulty at the time of her admission to Canada, and that her residency status in Germany was not in jeopardy until at least six months after she left Germany. Indeed, the Applicant's own evidence suggests that German authorities would have let her back in.
