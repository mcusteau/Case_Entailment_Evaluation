 [49] 
  Even if I were to disregard my significant concerns with the quality of the evidence before the Board, the evidence adduced, in my view, does not support the conclusion reached by the Board. The particular provision referred to by the Board - section 44(1)2 - states that a person's residency in Germany lapses if the person leaves "for a purpose that is  
 inherently 
  other than temporary" (my emphasis). The Board appears to have accepted that the Respondent's entirely subjective decision to leave Germany and not return is sufficient under German law to establish the loss of residency status. The Board accepted her counsel's argument that it was unnecessary for the German authorities to know of the Respondent's intention to leave Germany permanently in order for section 44(1)2 to become operative. Accordingly, all that was required was her thinking that her leaving was "other than temporary". Such an interpretation would also mean that the Respondent could have returned to Germany if she had been unsuccessful in claiming refugee protection in Canada since German authorities would have been unaware of her intention to leave Germany permanently.
