  At the outset, I wish to confirm that this is not a case concerning the operative date of the Article 1E exclusion. In his decision in  
 Choovak 
 , above, Justice Rouleau established that date to be the time of the Respondent's admission to Canada. In following Justice Rouleau's decision, the Board stated the relevant date for determining whether the Respondent is excluded from refugee protection in Canada as being September 15, 1999. The parties in this application for judicial review do not dispute this finding.
