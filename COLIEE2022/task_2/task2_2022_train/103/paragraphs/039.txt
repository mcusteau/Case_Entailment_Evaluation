  In understanding the role played by the Board in this case, it is necessary to consider the purpose of the  
 IRPA 
  more generally and the exclusion provision, in particular. With respect to refugee protection, the purpose of the  
 IRPA 
  is to provide a safe haven in Canada to persons who have established a well-founded fear of persecution: see the  
 IRPA 
 , subsection 3(2). However, the  
 IRPA 
  also places restrictions on who is entitled to refugee protection in Canada. Specifically, section 98 of the  
 IRPA 
  - the exclusion provision - stipulates that persons who come within the definition of Article 1E of the  
 Refugee Convention 
  cannot be found to be Convention refugees by the Board. As such, the role of the Board is to determine whether the Respondent is entitled to refugee protection in Canada, rather than to balance between interlocking interests. Taken as a whole, the legislative purpose of the  
 IRPA 
  suggests a lesser degree of deference ought to be granted to the Board with respect to its finding that the Respondent is not subject to Article 1E of the  
 Refugee Convention 
 .
