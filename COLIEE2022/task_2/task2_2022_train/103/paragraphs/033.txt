  The  
 IRPA 
  contains neither a privative clause nor a statutory right of appeal. However, by virtue of subsection 72(1), a party can apply to judicially review decisions of the Board to the Federal Court; such applications require leave of the Court. Notwithstanding the restricted right to challenge decisions of the Board, I am of the view that, with regard to this first factor, Parliament intended the Court to retain its general supervisory jurisdiction.
