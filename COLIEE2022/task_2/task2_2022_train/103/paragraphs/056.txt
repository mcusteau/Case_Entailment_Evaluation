  I find that the Board committed a reviewable error in determining that the Respondent was not subject to Article 1E of the  
 Refugee Convention 
 . I would set aside the decision of the Board. In my opinion, the only conclusion that can be reached in the circumstances of this case is that at the time of her admission to Canada, competent authorities in Germany would have considered the Respondent to have the rights and obligations afforded to a German national, including the right to return to Germany. In my view, the result is inevitable. Pursuant to section 98 of the  
 IRPA 
 , the Respondent is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
