  The Applicant asserts that the Board erred in finding that the Respondent was not excluded by virtue of Article 1E of the  
 United Nation Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 
 , July 28, 1951, [1969] Can. T.S. No. 6 (the  
 Refugee Convention 
 ). The Applicant does not challenge the Board's finding that the Respondent had established a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran due to her perceived political opinion, her religion, and her membership in a particular social group.
