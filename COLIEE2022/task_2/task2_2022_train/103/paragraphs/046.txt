  The issue for the Court to determine is whether such a finding was reasonably open to the Board. In my opinion, the Board's decision cannot stand. In the circumstances of this case, I find that it was unreasonable for the Board to hold that the meaning of German law turns on the subjective desire of the Respondent.
