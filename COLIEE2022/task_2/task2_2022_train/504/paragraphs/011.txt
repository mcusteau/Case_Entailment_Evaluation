I turn then to my jurisdiction in this case to grant the reconsideration requested. Firstly there was no oversight on my part respecting the evidence before me. I knew that counsel would be attending the Bar Convention. I also determined that she was in control of the scheduling of the preparation of the application record and knew of the Bar Convention commitment well in advance of its occurrence. I thus could not justify granting an extension of time on the basis of the material filed. I did not know that counsel was attending the Bar Convention as a member of Provincial Council, rather than merely as a member at large. I cannot honestly say at this time whether if I had known that fact it would have affected my decision. It certainly does not make counsel's absence from town any more unanticipated. It does add an element of constraint on her ability to change her plans. The capacity in which she was attending the convention was however known at the time the application for an extension of time was filed. It is not information which has recently come to light. I am not convinced that circumstances exist which allow a reconsideration of my order.
