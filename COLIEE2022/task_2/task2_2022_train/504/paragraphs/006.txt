Counsel for the respondent opposes the request for a reconsideration. She notes that it is out of time since it was filed more than 10 days after the date of the order denying the extension of time. In addition, it is argued that the grounds do not fall within the limited circumstances in which this court can reconsider the terms of its own orders. Rule 337(5) provides a mechanism for the court to reconsider orders made where the court commits an oversight. Rule 337(5) does not allow the court to reexamine the conclusions which it has drawn from the evidence:
Keleher et al. v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans)
(1989), 26 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.). The present case is not a case in which some matter should have been dealt with was accidentally overlooked or omitted. Counsel for the respondent also argues:
"The respondent also takes the position that, on the merits, this is not an appropriate case for reconsideration. Madame Justice Reed, in the order in question, stated that the personal schedule of counsel is not sufficient reason for an extension to be granted. There was material before the court that the reason the extension was sought was counsel's attendance at the Canadian Bar Association convention. Clearly, this was a professional matter, and not merely a personal commitment. However, the scheduling difficulties which resulted for counsel are personal to counsel. The respondent submits that conflicts between client deadlines and nonclient professional commitments, including attendance at Bar Conventions (whether as a member of Provincial Council or as a member at large) and attendance at Continuing Legal Education seminars for five days out of a 30 day time limit are not sufficient reasons to warrant the court granting an extension of time."
