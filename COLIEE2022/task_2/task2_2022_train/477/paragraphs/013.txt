In my view, there is no reason that the scoring manual cannot be a document subject to disclosure pursuant to s. 24(1) of the
Regulations
. The test is whether the docu­ment contains information which pertains to the appellant and the successful candidate and, whether it is "liable to be disclosed before the appeal board". Without recourse to the scoring manual, Kaczmar and his representatives would have access to certain test papers which have been scored but would not be able to assess the consistency of scoring. Presumably the disclosure to a psychologist is intended to allay their fears on that issue. However, this is an adversarial process and Kaczmar's task is persuade the Appeal Board. Having his fears allayed does not assist in that process. The scoring man­ual contains information which pertains to the applicant and to the successful candidate, in that recourse to the scoring handbook is necessary to make sense of the candidates' test results. It therefore meets the first leg of the test in s. 24(1).
