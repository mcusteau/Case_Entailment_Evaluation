The Attorney General's claim is that the Appeal Board did not have jurisdiction to authorize the making of notes amounting to a transcription or the taking of copies of the material to which an objection to production had been made under s. 24(3) of the
Regula­tions
. He points to the very specific wording of the
Regulations
which governs dis­closure:
1 - Section 24(1) provides that an appellant shall have
access
to any document that pertains to the successful candidate or to the appellant.
2 - Section 24(2) provides that the deputy head may provide a
copy
of any document referred to in subs. (1)
3 - Section 24(3) provides that the deputy head may refuse to allow
access
or to provide a
copy
of a document for specified reasons
4 - Section 24(4) provides that the Public Service Commission may refuse to allow
access
or to provide a
copy
of a document for specified reasons.
5 - Section 24(5) provides that where the deputy head or the Commission refuse
access
, the appellant may request that the Appeal Board order
access.
6 - Section 24(6) provides that where the Appeal Board orders
access
, that access may be subject to certain conditions.
