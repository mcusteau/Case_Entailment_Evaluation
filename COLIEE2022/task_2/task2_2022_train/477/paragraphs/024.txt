I begin from the proposition that the purpose of the disclosure provision is to enable an unsuccessful candidate to test whether the appointment was made accord足ing to merit. Because the legislation contem足plates that names on the eligibility list will be ranked by order of merit, there is an issue as to merit between the appellant and each person whose name which appears above his or hers. The order of placement of the name on the list reflects a determination of relative merit as between the appellant and each of those candidates. Since each person whose name appears on the list above that of the appellant should be appointed prior to the appellant, each of those persons represents a successful candidate from the point of view of the appellant. That is certainly so at the time the list is created. Is there a rationale for dealing with the list at some date other than the date of its creation? The successful candidate is defined by reference to being placed on the list ahead of the appellant, a state of affairs which came into being at the time the list was created. Subsequent events do not alter the relative ranking. More im足portantly, subsequent events do not alter the fairness and consistency of the ranking. If disclosure is intended to allow a candidate to confirm that the merit principle has been applied, the material time for disclosure ought to be the time when the merit prin足ciple was to be applied which is the time of creation of the list. In the end result, the applicant is entitled to access to the test results of all those candidates who were placed on the eligibility list.
