The defendant, Nguyen, argues that Vogo has provided no particulars as to his personal actions that amount to wilful infringement, however, a review of paragraphs 3 and 4 of the statement of claim in action T-1361-03 indicates otherwise. It is specifically alleged that Nguyen looks after all of the business of Acme, designed the locks for Acme that allegedly infringe Vogo's Patent while he was aware of the Patent and directed Acme to continue selling the allegedly infringing locks. It is my view that these allegations are sufficiently particular to allow Nguyen to plead in defence.
