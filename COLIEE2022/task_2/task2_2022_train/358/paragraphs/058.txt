The second decision that the Prothonotary made was not to stay the proceedings in action T-1361-03 pending the determination of action T-630-02. I am of the opinion that the Prothonotary's decision not to stay the proceedings in action T-1361-03 is not a question vital to the final issue of the case and ought not to be disturbed unless the Prothonotary's exercise of discretion was based on a wrong principle or a misapprehension of the facts.
