Nuyen filed affidavit evidence on this motion. Vogo argued that affidavit evidence is not admissible on a motion to strike made pursuant to Rule 221. My reading of Rule 221(2) leads me to conclude that Rule 221(2) only prohibits evidence being led on a motion made pursuant to Rule 221(1)(a). In this case, Nguyen's motion to strike was based on all the grounds set out in Rule 221(1). The jurisprudence of this Court also has established that, subject to limited exceptions which do not apply here, the appeal of a prothonotary's order should be based only on the evidence that was before the prothonotary. Consequently, the new affidavit of Nguyen, to the extent that it contains evidence that was not before the Prothonotary, is not admissible on this appeal.
