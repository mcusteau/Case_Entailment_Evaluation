The purpose of the "fresh step" rule is to prevent a party from acting inconsistently with its prior conduct in the proceeding. By pleading in response to a statement of claim, for instance, a defendant may extinguish their right to complain of fatal deficiencies in the allegations made against them. The fresh step rule aims to prevent prejudice to a party who has governed themselves according to the procedural steps taken by the opposing side, where it would be unfair to permit a reversal in approach.
