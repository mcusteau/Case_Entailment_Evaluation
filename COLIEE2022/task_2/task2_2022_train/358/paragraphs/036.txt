Acme and Nguyen argue that the consolidation order should be overturned for many of the same reasons it is alleged that the dismissal order should be overturned. Specifically, Acme and Nguyen submit that the Prothonotary erred in granting the consolidation order:
1. When Vogo had not sufficiently demonstrated that the Acme and Nguyen would not suffer an injustice;
2. Without addressing that the two actions were identical except for the parties named as defendants and that it was Vogo itself that had commenced the multiplicity of proceedings so allowing consolidation would only prevent undue expense that Vogo itself had caused;
3. Even though Vogo had not directly demonstrated that Nguyen should be a defendant to T-630-02;
4. Before consideration and decision of Nguyen's motion to strike, since the motion to strike was filed before the motion to consolidate;
5. Even thought it was premature because the order was made before the pleadings in T-1361-03 were closed. Nguyen had not yet filed a Statement of Defence when the two actions were consolidated. Acme and Nguyen submit that consolidation should not have been decided before the the issues in T-1361-03 were fully determined by a complete set of pleadings.
