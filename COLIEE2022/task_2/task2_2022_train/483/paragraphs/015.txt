After credibility, the Board goes on to analyze the possibility of an IFA in Colombo, where the applicant resided prior to coming to Canada. The Board notes that the documentary evidence pertaining to Colombo has changed over the last two years. The Board cites the Directorate Information and Refugee Board Issue Paper on Sri Lankan developments since the February 2003 cease-fire, issued in March 2003. The Board bases the Colombo IFA on two points: (1) the Colombo registration requirements are no longer in effect, which means that since 2002, there has been no complaints of police officers demanding registrations; and (2) In Colombo, most checkpoints and roadblocks were dismantled by January 2003, which in turn means that there were no reports of "round-ups" of Tamils in Colombo between October 2002 and March 2003.
