Since I have already concluded that the Applicant's allegations with respect to the threat of extortion have not been dealt with adequately by the Board, and were dismissed without much explanation, I can not rule out the possibility that the Applicant may have at least an arguable case under section 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The deficiencies within the Board's credibility findings, in the context of section 96 undermine its findings under section 97.
