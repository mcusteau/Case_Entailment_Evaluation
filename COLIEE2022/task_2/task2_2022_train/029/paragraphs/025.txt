  As to the second report, dated December 2, 2002, it appears the applicant refused to divulge the whereabouts of her husband and claimed the incident was an argument between husband and wife. Again, the applicant, her family and accompanying friends were advised to contact police and the station should the abuse continue, and were again referred to PNP Women in Crisis Help and Info Desk. Once more, the panel was of the view that this did not demonstrate a lack of protection on the part of the authorities.
