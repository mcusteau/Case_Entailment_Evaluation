  In the case at bar, the applicant contends that the tribunal erred by failing to consider the applicant's accounts of incidents where state protection did not materialize. The applicant provided two police reports to the Tribunal, but these reports were found not to indicate a lack of protection. The applicant stated that although her case was referred to the PNP Women in Crisis Help and Info Desk, she did not receive any assistance and was told to wait since there were other cases before her case.
