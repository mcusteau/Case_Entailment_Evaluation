  I am unable to conclude that it was unreasonable for the tribunal to find that the applicant failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. There may well have been delays in processing the applicant's case at the NGO established at the police station, but this is a far cry from saying that the applicant's claim was ignored. Moreover, the police explicitly told the applicant and her family to come back to the station if ever there were other instances of domestic violence. Finally, the applicant herself seemed to have been of two minds on December 2, 2002, when she complained to the police but refused to give the whereabouts of her husband. The report shows that, despite the applicant's reticence, the husband was contacted by police investigators. This is clearly not illustrative of an unwillingness on the part of the police to follow up on the applicant's complaint and as such, this case can be easily distinguished from previous cases where an applicant had been rebuffed or ignored by the authorities.
