  Finally, the applicant argued that the tribunal failed to provide any rationale for preferring the documentary evidence over the applicant's testimony. I agree that it would be objectionable to state that documentary evidence should always be preferred to that of a refugee claimant because the latter is interested in the outcome of the hearing (see  
 Coitinho 
  v.  
 Canada (MCI) 
 , 2004 FC 1037, 132 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1154), especially when the applicant was found to be credible (see  
 Ramsaywack 
  v.  
 Canada (MCI) 
 , 2005 FC 781, 46 Imm. L.R. (3d) 249). However. it is also true that an applicant's account cannot be wholly determinative. One must look at the overall picture to determine if it was reasonable to expect an applicant to seek state protection. In performing that assessment, the tribunal is entitled to rely on and prefer documentary evidence to that of a claimant:  
 Zvonov 
  v. Canada (MCI) (1994), 83 F.T.R. 138 (T.D.), 28 Imm. L.R. (2d) 23;  
 Zhou v. Canada (MEI) 
  (1994), 49 A.C.W.S. (3d) 558, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1087 (F.C.A.) (QL). In the case at bar, the tribunal found that the documentary evidence was from a variety of reliable and independent sources, none of which had any vested interest in whether or not the applicant is determined to be a Convention refugee. Moreover, the applicant's experiences predated the enactment of the new legislation in 2004. On those bases, the tribunal could prefer the documentary evidence to that of the applicant.
