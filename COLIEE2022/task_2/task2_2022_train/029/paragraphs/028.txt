  Ultimately, it is not the task of this Court to determine whether it would have come to the same conclusion as the tribunal, but rather to consider whether the decision falls within a range of acceptable outcomes in light of the facts and of the law. Not only was the tribunal entitled to find that the evidence submitted by the applicant to rebut the presumption of state protection was not convincing, but its assessment was bolstered by the documentary evidence that was submitted. After perusing that evidence, the tribunal recognized that domestic violence is still a serious problem in the Philippines and that state protection may not be perfect. The panel found, however, that the Philippines are a functioning democracy, and that major steps have been taken to address the issue of domestic violence, including the 2004 Anti-Violence Act Against Women and Children. This statute criminalizes physical, sexual and psychological harm or abuse to woman and their children by their spouses or partners, provides for the death penalty in cases of rape, and makes protection orders available. While this Act, in and of itself, would be insufficient to conclude that the Philippines do effectively protect women in the situation of the applicant, there is evidence suggesting that it is actually implemented. The U.S. DOS Report of 2006, quoted by the tribunal, indicates that during that year, the PNP reported 818 cases under this new law and 2,015 other cases of wife battering and physical injuries under older laws. This same report also shows that there is a large network of NGO's able to provide support to the victims, and offering gender sensitivity training to deal with victims of sexual crimes and domestic violence. On this basis, the tribunal could reasonably find that the applicant did not rebut the presumption of state protection, and it is not for this Court to reweigh the evidence that was before the tribunal.
