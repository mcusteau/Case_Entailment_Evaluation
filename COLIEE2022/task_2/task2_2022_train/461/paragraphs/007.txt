Based on
Chen, Huang
and
Li
, and having closely reviewed the tribunal's record, including the transcripts, overall, I find the Board's conclusion unreasonable. There is evidence in the record that members of the Falun Gong group have been persecuted in China. The Board's finding that the applicant was able to leave China without incident does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the applicant is not, and never has been, a Falun Gong practitioner either in China or in Canada. Indeed, despite the fact that the Board had some credibility concerns with respect to the particular means by which the claimant left China, an assessment of the applicant's Falun Gong activities, both in China and in Canada, was nevertheless necessary considering the documentary evidence on record and the elaborate testimony of the applicant on this very central issue of her claim. The Board's failure to perform such an assessment constitutes a reviewable error and justifies a redetermination of the applicant's claim.
