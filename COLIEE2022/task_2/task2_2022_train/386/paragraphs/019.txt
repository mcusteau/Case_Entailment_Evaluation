Section 39(1) refers to "a pension awarded for disability ...". It is apparent that a pension for disability and compensation for the fact of having been a prisoner of war or an evader during the Second World War are two distinct matters. A disability, while it must have its origin in the war, may have been obvious and diagnosed during or at the end of the War and may have been of a continuing nature. But sometimes the effects of war time service are not felt or diagnosed until years after the war. Disabilities come in varying degrees and may change over time. All of these matters require assessments through applications and in some cases, disability may not be perceived or proven for years after the war or may vary in severity over a period of time. On the other hand, payment to former prisoners of war or evaders has throughout been described as "compensation" and the criteria solely depend on certain demonstrable historical facts occurring during the war. The fact that the compensation is payable on a monthly basis may have been thought to be of a more lasting benefit to those entitled. If compensation had been payable in a lump sum it would be surprising indeed if entitlement were dependent on the date of application for it, even though it would not be payable until application was made.
