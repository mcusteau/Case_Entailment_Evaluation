Strayer, D.J.
: These are applications for judicial review of two decisions of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board (the Board) in which the Board refused to reconsider its conclusions on previous Entitlement Appeals. The matter in issue is entitlement of two former Royal Canadian Air Force members to compensation for time spent as a prisoner of war or in evading capture in enemy or enemy-controlled territory. The matter in dispute is as to whether they are entitled to such compensation only as of the date of their applications for it or, as they claim, retroactively to April 1, 1976, which was the date of coming into force of legislation first providing for such compensation.
