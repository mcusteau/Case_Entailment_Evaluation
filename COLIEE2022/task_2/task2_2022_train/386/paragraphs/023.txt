Counsel for the respondent cited two decisions of this Court where retroactivity of benefits had been limited:
Cadotte v. Canada (Minist√®re des Anciens Combattants)
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 966; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1513 (F.C.); and
Sangster v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2002] F.C.J. No. 117; 216 F.T.R. 148 (T.D.). In my view these cases are clearly distinguishable. They both involved disability pensions whose coming into effect is governed by s. 39(1) of the
Pension Act
. For reasons which I have stated, I have concluded that prisoner of war compensation is distinguishable in this respect and that s. 39(1) is not made applicable to such compensation by the general incorporation by reference of s. 39 in s. 71.2(4).
