For many years after the Second World War there was no program for compensating prisoners of war other than those who had been prisoners of the Japanese. In 1976, Parliament enacted the
Compensation for Former Prisoners of War Act
, S.C. 1976, c. 95. That
Act
provided for payment of compensation to those who were prisoners of war of enemy powers other than Japan during the Second World War. Section 3 of the
Act
said:
"3. A prisoner of war of another power is entitled, on application to the Commission, to compensation payable under Schedule A ..."
There was no specific mention as to the date from which compensation would be calculated. In 1978, Parliament amended this
Act
by S.C. 1978, c. 11, to provide similar compensation for "evaders" defined as members of the Canadian or Newfoundland Forces who entered or landed in enemy territory and evaded capture. Both the 1976
Act
and the 1978 amendment had a coming into force provision deeming them to have come into force on April 1, 1976. It is common ground that, as long as these
Acts
contained the provisions for compensation for prisoners of war and evaders, the compensation in the form of a monthly allowance was paid by the Canadian Pension Commission effective April 1, 1976, regardless of when application was made by a prisoner or an evader.
