In both cases, it was argued before the Board on behalf of the appellants that the timing for commencement of benefits prescribed by s. 39 of the
Pension Act
should not be applied to compensation for prisoners of war and evaders. It was argued that by the
Compensation for Former Prisoners of War Act
and its amendments, compensation was made payable in monthly instalments commencing on April 1, 1976. It was argued that there was no clear intent stated by Parliament in 1987, when it consolidated prisoners of war compensation with pensions, that those who were up until that time entitled to the former effective April 1, 1976, once they applied for it, were no longer to be so entitled even though they had not applied before 1987 because they had never been told about the availability of such benefits. There being no express intention by Parliament to that effect, and s. 71.2(4) of the
Pension Act
being at best ambiguous, the principles of statutory interpretation should prevail. In particular provisions of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, were relied upon as follows:
"43. Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the repeal does not ...
. . . . .
(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the enactment so repealed,
. . . . .
"44. Where an enactment, in this section called the 'former enactment', is repealed and another enactment, in this section called the 'new enactment' is substituted therefor, ...
. . . . .
(f) except to the extent that the provisions of the new enactment are not in substance the same as those of the former enactment, the new enactment shall not be held to operate as new law, but shall be construed and have effect as a consolidation and as declaratory of the law as contained in the former enactment;"
"43. L'abrogation, en tout ou en partie, n'a pas pour conséquence: ...
. . . . .
c) de porter atteinte aux droits ou avantages acquis, aux obligations contractées ou aux responsabilités encourues sous le régime du texte abrogé;
. . . . .
"44. En cas d'abrogation et de remplacement, les règles suivantes s'appliquent: ...
. . . . .
f) sauf dans la mesure où les deux textes diffèrent au fond, le nouveau texte n'est pas réputé de droit nouveau, sa teneur étant censée constituer une refonte et une clarification des règles de droit du texte antérieur;"
