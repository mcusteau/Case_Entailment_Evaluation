Mr. Trotter had never been informed of the original 1976
Act
although he was in communication with the Department that year in respect of another matter, some six months after the enactment of the
Compensation for Former Prisoners of War Act
. When he finally learned that compensation was available he applied in 1991 for it. He was awarded pension benefits effective April 9, 1991, which was the date of his application under the
Pension Act
. The Department of Veterans Affairs took the position that by s. 39 of the
Pension Act
compensation was, after the amendment to the
Pension Act
in 1987, payable only commencing with the day of the application. Mr. Trotter took several appeals resulting in the decision of the Board which is the subject of this judicial review. The Board upheld the position of the Department of Veterans Affairs.
