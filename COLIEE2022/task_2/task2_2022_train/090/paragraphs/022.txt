 [22] 
  In dismissing the application, the Respondent determined that the entries in the medical text  
 Neurology in Clinical Practice 
  did not address the Applicant's functional capacity and therefore would not have impacted the Respondent's August 1998 decision. The Respondent further noted that while the information contained in the Applicant's handwritten notes concerning events from 1999 to 2001 had not been discoverable in 1998, it could not be considered material to his functional capacity as of August 1998 and therefore would not have impacted the Respondent's decision. The Respondent informed the Applicant that his handwritten notes containing information concerning events of 1998 were discoverable at the time of the August 1998 decision, and therefore could not be considered new facts. The Respondent further noted that the copy of its May 28, 1998 questionnaire, which the Applicant had faxed to the Respondent in August 1998, had been considered by the Respondent when the Respondent made its August 1998 decision and therefore could not be considered to be new facts.
