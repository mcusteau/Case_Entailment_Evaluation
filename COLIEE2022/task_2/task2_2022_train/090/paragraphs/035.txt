  The Respondent contends that the applicable standard of review of a decision on eligibility for disability or a determination of new facts under subsection 84(2) of the  
 CPP 
  is that of patent unreasonableness. The authorities cited by the Respondent in support of this position are decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal which pre-date  
 Sketchley v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2005), 344 N.R. 257; 2005 FCA 404. In Sketchley, the Court of Appeal held that it was necessary to conduct a pragmatic and functional analysis with respect to the particular questions at issue in order to ascertain the applicable standard of review. Here, the issue involves applying the new facts test to the documents tendered by the Applicant. The issue involves a question of mixed fact and law. It is unnecessary to determine the applicable standard in the circumstances since I find that, on any standard of review, the Court's intervention is not warranted. The Respondent correctly decided that the tendered documents do not constitute new facts for the purpose of the Applicant's subsection 84(2) application.
