The applicants argue that the decision of the respondent Band Council cannot stand since the Election Regulations do not authorize the suspension of members of the Band Council. The respondents, however, argue that the decision was properly authorized by the Election Regulations, which give the Chief and Council the authority to make decisions "for the proper governance of the Sucker Creek First Nation." Further, the respondents rely on the view that legislative bodies such as the respondent Band Council have the power to suspend or expel one of its members, and that this power has long been the prerogative of the legislature and is independent of any explicit statutory provisions enabling such action. Accordingly, the respondents submit that the Band Council has the "inherent authority to make rules and procedures to govern their own process including policies and procedures to investigate allegations of misconduct."
