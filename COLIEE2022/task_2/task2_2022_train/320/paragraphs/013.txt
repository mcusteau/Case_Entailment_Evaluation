The Adjudicator decided that the Respondent has been unjustly dismissed and awarded damages. He found that the Respondent had approached three senior employees at the Comox branch of the Royal Bank, with whom she discussed the propriety of accepting the $5,000 gift from Mr. Birchall. The Respondent had not approached her manager and the Adjudicator characterized this as an "unwise" choice on her part, justifying a 20% reduction in her award of damages. The Adjudicator found that the bank's customer had been a most impressive witness and specifically made the finding that the Respondent had been a credible witness. He did not make adverse credibility findings in respect of other witnesses but in his reasons, singled out both Mr. Birchall and the Respondent for particular mention.
