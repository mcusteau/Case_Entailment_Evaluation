The Applicant said that Mr. Birchall had spoken of giving her a monthly gift in appreciation for her visits. At the interview the Applicant said that Mr. Birchall had raised this subject about a year to eighteen months before. Initially, Mr. Birchall spoke of leaving the gift in his Will. The Applicant said that she told Mr. Birchall that she was not visiting him for money but to keep him company. She also said that she told him that she was unsure if she could accept such a gift. She read the Code of conduct and concluded that the gift had nothing to do with her employment with the Applicant and that it was not "bank related".
