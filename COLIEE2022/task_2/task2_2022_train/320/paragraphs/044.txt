With respect to the Adjudicator's findings of credibility, the Respondent submits that a great degree of deference is to be granted in this regard. As the trier of fact, the decision-maker is in the best position to assess the credibility of a witness' testimony; see
Housen v. Nikolaisen et al.
, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; 286 N.R. 1; 219 Sask.R. 1; 272 W.A.C. 1; 211 D.L.R.(4th) 577; 2002 SCC 33. The Respondent argues that the contradictions between the evidence of Mr. Birchall and the Respondent at the hearing, relied upon by the Applicant, are matters of detail which do not impact upon the real issues before the Adjudicator. She argues that what was crucial to the Adjudicator's determination was why Mr. Birchall made the gift and whether he sought any banking advantage as a result of that gift.
