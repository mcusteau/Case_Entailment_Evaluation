The Applicant has argued that the Adjudicator's error with respect to his assessment of the Respondent's credibility is key to his assessment of one of the grounds upon which the Respondent was dismissed, that is on the basis of her dishonesty and evasiveness. I further note that the Adjudicator relied upon his conclusion that the Respondent was advised by senior employees of the bank that the relevant provisions of the Code of Conduct do not apply to bank tellers.
