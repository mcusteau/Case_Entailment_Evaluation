The first question is whether the Respondent's acceptance of the $5,000 gift from Mr. Birchall was in breach of the Code of Conduct. In my opinion, the Applicant is correct when it submits that apart from including the relevant sections of the Bank's Code of Conduct in his decision, the Adjudicator makes no further reference to the specific provisions of this policy. The Respondent's dismissal was fundamentally about her receipt of gifts and the Bank's policy on this issue is clearly set out in the Code of Conduct. The Adjudicator's decision shows that he accepted the Respondent's explanation that she and Ms. Lachappelle found the Code of Conduct to be confusing. However, he made no clear finding that the Respondent's acceptance of the $5,000 cheque amounted to a breach of the Bank's Code of Conduct.
