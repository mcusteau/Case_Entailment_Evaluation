The Applicant submits that the transcript of the interview was entered as an exhibit at the hearing before the Adjudicator and a careful reading shows that the interview was of an entirely appropriate nature, lasting approximately one hour and 15 minutes. The Respondent was asked direct and straightforward questions. Further, the Respondent was asked if she had reviewed the Acknowledgement of Rights form and was clear about it, and the purpose of the interview. She agreed that she had read it and she did understand the nature and purpose of the interview. At the hearing before the Adjudicator, the Respondent testified that she was presented with an Acknowledgement of Rights form, which she had signed and that she must have been aware that she was free to terminate the interview at any time.
