[62]
Accordingly, while I accept that the Adjudicator has significant discretion with respect to the procedural aspect of the hearing, I am persuaded by the Applicant's argument that his refusal to permit re-examination on a point not arising prior to the cross-examination, upon which he clearly relied, amounted to a denial of procedural fairness. However, I will continue to address other grounds advanced by the Applicant in this application for judicial review.
