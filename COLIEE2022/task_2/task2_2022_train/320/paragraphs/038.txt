The Applicant submits that the Respondent was responsible for being aware of the terms of the Code of Conduct and that Code clearly advises employees to consult their managers or the key contacts listed if they are uncertain about a course of action. The Applicant argues that the Respondent's disregard for the clear wording of the Code of Conduct and of the advice of her co-worker, whom she trusted to give her advice, was clearly a breach of Code of Conduct which in and of itself was sufficient to justify her dismissal. Consequently, the Applicant argues that the Adjudicator's position to reduce the quantum of damages by 20%, rather than uphold the termination, was patently unreasonable.
