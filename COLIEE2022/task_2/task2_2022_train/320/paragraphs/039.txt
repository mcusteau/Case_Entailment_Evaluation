The Applicant further argued that the Adjudicator erred in law in awarding damages for emotional distress to the Respondent in the amount of $8,000, in the absence of evidence establishing the elements of emotional distress and without any medical evidence. In addressing this lack of evidence, the Adjudicator wrote as follows:
"Counsel for the Bank has argued that I require professional medical evidence substantiating this amount. Such evidence was not available to the hearing. I feel that Ms. Siu's evidence is adequate and I do not feel that corroborating medical evidence is necessary because of the short term nature of the health problems which occurred."
