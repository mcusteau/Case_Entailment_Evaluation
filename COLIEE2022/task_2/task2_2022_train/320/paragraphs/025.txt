The Applicant submits that the Adjudicator's finding was made in a perverse or capricious manner since there was no evidence presented at the hearing to support such a finding. The evidence of Noreen Galeazzi was contained in an agreed statement of facts. That statement of facts is silent as to whether the Respondent and Ms. Galeazzi had studied the Code of Conduct and drew any such conclusions regarding its application. Further, no such evidence was adduced in the Respondent's evidence, either in direct or cross-examination.
