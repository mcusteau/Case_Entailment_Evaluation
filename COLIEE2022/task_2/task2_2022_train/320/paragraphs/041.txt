The Respondent argued that, given the presence of a privative clause in s. 243 of the
Labour Code
, the decision of the Adjudicator is subject to review on a very high standard, that is the standard of patent unreasonableness. Relying on
Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter Ltd. v. Kmet
(1998), 149 F.T.R. 246 (T.D.), the Respondent submits that this standard means that the decision should stand unless it cannot be rationally supported by enabling legislation and justice requires the intervention of the Court. The standard of patent unreasonableness is a very strict test, as discussed in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Public Service Alliance of Canada
, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 941; 150 N.R. 161 and
Paccar of Canada Ltd. v. Canadian Association of Industrial, Mechanical and Allied Workers, Local 14
, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 983; 102 N.R. 1; 62 D.L.R.(4th) 437.
