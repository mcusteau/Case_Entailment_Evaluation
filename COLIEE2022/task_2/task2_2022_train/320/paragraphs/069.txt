That conclusion ties in with the most serious aspect of the Adjudicator's decision, that is his failure to answer central legal questions. The Adjudicator was seized with the task of reviewing the Bank's termination of the Respondent, in order to determine whether she had been unjustly dismissed. With respect to the concept of unjust dismissal in the
Labour Code
, supra, the Federal Court of Appeal discussed an Adjudicator's mandate with respect to a dismissal, in
Hall√© v. Bell Canada
(1989), 99 N.R. 149 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 10 as follows:
"The question presented to him was whether the respondent had been unjustly dismissed. In order to answer this, he first had to consider the nature, sufficiency and merits of the reasons for dismissal. Accordingly, in the case at bar the adjudicator should have considered whether the applicant had any basis for complaint about the respondent's performance and whether this provided grounds for dismissal. If the adjudicator had answered these questions in the affirmative, he should then have considered whether the procedure leading to dismissal of the employee was fair."
