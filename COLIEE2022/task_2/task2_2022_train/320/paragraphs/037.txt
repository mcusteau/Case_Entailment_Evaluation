The Applicant argues that the Adjudicator, having found that the Respondent breached her duty as an employee in failing to consult with her manager, erred in law by failing to apply this breach to the question of whether she had been unjustly dismissed by the Bank. Rather, the Adjudicator applied this breach solely in relation to the question of quantum of damages and found as follows:
"On Ms. Siu's own evidence, she admitted that she did not follow up on the suggestion by one of her confidants that she consult with the Manager. This may have been unwise in retrospect, but it is not unreasonable to conclude that by this time she considered that discussion on the matter had been exhausted. However, this failure must be considered in assessing damages."
