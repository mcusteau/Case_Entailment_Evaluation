The assessment of evidence and witnesses is at the very heart of the Adjudicator's role. This Court grants considerable deference to an Adjudicator's decision on such matters. In light of the highly discretionary standard of review and in the absence of a transcript of the hearing before the Adjudicator, it is difficult to assess whether the credibility findings were patently unreasonable.
