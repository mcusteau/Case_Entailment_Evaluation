In this case, the Adjudicator allowed the Applicant to call Ms. Lachappelle as a rebuttal witness, on a very limited ground, after the completion of the Respondent's case. Although the Adjudicator had a discretion whether to allow the calling of rebuttal evidence, having exercised that discretion, the Adjudicator ought to have allowed the Applicant to address a matter that was raised in cross-examination of Ms. Lachappelle in the context of the rebuttal evidence. The Adjudicator permitted the Respondent to raise the question of confusion in respect of the Code of Conduct in cross-examining Ms. Lachappelle after she gave her rebuttal evidence. This was a new issue arising from cross-examination and in my opinion, the Adjudicator's refusal to permit re-examination on that point amounts to a breach of the rules of natural justice.
