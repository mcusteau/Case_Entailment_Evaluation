  The petitioner relies on R. v. Oakes (1983), 40 O.R.(2d) 660 (Ont. C.A.), for the proposition that all laws passed by Parliament as well as all rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter are tempered by the stipulation of s. 1. He also relies on the judgment of Hugessen, J., in Luscher v. Deputy Minister of National Revenue (1985), 57 N.R. 386; 45 C.R.(3d) 81, for the principle that "a limit which is vague, ambiguous, uncertain, or subject to discretionary determination is, by that fact alone, an unreasonable limit". He argues that the words "subject to any terms or conditions it considers desirable" are not sufficiently clear and subject the rights and freedoms of a parolee solely and totally to the discretionary determination of the Board.
