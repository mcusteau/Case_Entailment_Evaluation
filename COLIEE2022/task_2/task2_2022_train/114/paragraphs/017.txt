  In Cadieux v. Director of Mountain Institution and National Parole Board (1984), 41 C.R.(3d) 30, the prisoner, under an unescorted temporary absence, had his program cancelled by reason of a confidential report which the Board refused to share with him. The court held it did "not think that non-disclosure of the gist of the case against the applicant can be justified on the basis or a claim for a class exemption".
