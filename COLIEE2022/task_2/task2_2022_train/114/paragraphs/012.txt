  It must be borne in mind that the parole supervisor is not an employee of the Board and that the latter has access to other sources of information, including the police. Moreover, the petitioner was afforded the opportunity to make his representations to the Board. His attorney filed the legal arguments above referred to, mostly in response to the reasons for imposing the condition, but did not argue that the board breached its duty to act fairly. I therefore move on to the four legal arguments.
