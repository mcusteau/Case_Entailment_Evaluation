  The petitioner submits that the Board, by imposing conditions of parole, in effect establishes prescriptions of law by way of enabling legislation and any such condition is therefore submissive to the Charter. Such condition must be sufficiently clear, precise and definite so as to afford the petitioner fair and proper notice as to what acts or conduct are prohibited upon pain of punishment. Secondly, the condition must be worded in sufficiently specific terms so as to adequately safeguard against arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.
