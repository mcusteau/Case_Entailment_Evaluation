  It is the petitioner's contention that upon the plain face of the condition, if he were to have "any non-fortuitous meetings or communications with people having a criminal record", whether the petitioner was aware or not that the individual had been convicted of a criminal offence in the past, he would be in breach of his parole and liable to immediate reincarceration at the loss of his earned remission. He claims that the addendum "or whom you think might have a criminal record", is even more irrational, vague and arbitrary, according to the petitioner.
