  In Reich v. College of Physicians & Surgeons of Alta. (1984), 53 A.R. 325; 8 D.L.R.(4th) 696; 9 C.R.R. 90; 31 Alta. L.R.(2d) 205 (Q.B.), the court adopted the principles enunciated in an article titled "The Limitation of Liberty: A Consideration of Section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms" by T.J. Christian as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Any limit upon Charter rights must be rationally connected to the attainment of a legitimate state object ... 
 
 
 
 "Further, any limit on Charter rights must not be a more excessive limitation than is necessary to obtain the legitimate state object. Any restriction on a Charter right must be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued ... 
 
 
 
 "Finally, any limit on Charter rights must be not inspired by arbitrary or capricious reasons, or be motivated by bad faith."
