  I cannot find, in this instance, that the condition imposed upon the petitioner was not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. To be sure, the condition represents a further incursion upon his freedom, but it was imposed in accordance with the basic tenets of our legal system. The petitioner has not established any procedural or substantive violation. He was given full opportunity to meet the case that was placed before the Board and indeed, through his solicitor, filed written representations which representations, again, dealt with general principles of law but did not establish any breach of the principles of fundamental justice by the Board in the petitioner's case.
