  In Malone v. United States of America (1974), 502 F. 2d 544, the terms of probation imposed upon a parolee prohibited him from participating in any American Irish Republican movement and from belonging to any Irish organization, etc. The United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, found that a convicted criminal may be reasonably restricted, as part of his sentence, with respect with his associations in order to prevent his future criminality. It held (at page 556) that there was a "reasonable nexus between the probation conditions and the goals of probation".
