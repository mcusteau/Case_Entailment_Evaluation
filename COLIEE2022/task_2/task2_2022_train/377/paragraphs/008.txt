It is the statement in the immigration officer's notes that consideration was given to whether the applicant would face greater risk in the general population and whether she would be individually targeted which is at issue here. In a recent judgment in a similar situation (
Muse v. Solicitor General
(17 August 1993), Court file no. 93-T-52 (F.C.T.D.)), Pinard, J., found the following at page 2:
"Given the available information on the civil violence in Somalia, distributed by human rights organizations such as Amnesty International, and given the Minister of Employment and Immigration's own statement at the time that of the remaining six million Somalies (sic), '1.5 million are on the verge of starvation and three million are also in desperate need', I can only find that
by requiring the applicant be at greater risk
than anyone else in the Somali population, the respondent's officials fettered their own discretion by imposing a rigid requirement which was inconsistent with the intent of the
Immigration Act
and the ministerial policy." (my underline)
However, in
Muse
, the situation in Somalia, as it related to the risk the applicant in that case would face upon return there, was the key element in the immigration officer's negative determination. In this case, the immigration officer did not give specific reasons in her letter, made no absolute evaluation of whether or not the applicant would face greater persecution if returned to Sri Lanka, and considered many other significant factors affecting her negative determination, including the rejection of the applicant's refugee claim and the denial of his leave application. Nothing in the immigration officer's letter or reasons indicates that any single factor was more important than another and, therefore, the decision was not fettered in any way. As her notes indicate, the immigration officer considered, among other factors, that the applicant was returning to Buffalo, not Sri Lanka, and that she would be provided adequate protection there. On the basis of the evidence before me, the immigration officer's considerations and conclusions appear reasonable.
