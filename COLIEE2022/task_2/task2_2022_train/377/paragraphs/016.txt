My reasoning above regarding the issues of an unreasonable or fettered decision and procedural unfairness apply within the context of a potential breach of fundamental justice. I do not believe that the immigration officer's consideration of the fact that the applicant faced removal to the United States or the failure to obtain assurance that she would not be deported to Sri Lanka constitute a breach of fundamental justice. As I stated above, the immigration officer's humanitarian and review of the applicant's situation considered many relevant factors and she was provided ample opportunity to respond.
