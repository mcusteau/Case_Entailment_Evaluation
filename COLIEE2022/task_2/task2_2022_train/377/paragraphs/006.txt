The applicant submits that the immigration officer's determination that her return to Sri Lanka would not result in unusual or disproportionate hardship is an unreasonable conclusion on the facts. Further, the immigration officer considered in her determination whether the applicant would be at a greater risk in the general population of Sri Lanka and if the applicant would be individually targeted. The applicant submits that the immigration officer applied the wrong criteria and that by limiting her assessment of hardship to the risk of persecution within the meaning of the Convention refugee definition she erred in law by fettering her discretion. The respondent submits that the immigration officer considered the decision of the CRDD, the documentary material submitted with respect to the conditions in Sri Lanka, and many other factors in determining whether sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds existed. The respondent maintains that the decision was a reasonable one and that the immigration officer did not fetter her discretion because she considered a wide variety of factors.
