In support of the submission that the duty of fairness includes a right to a hearing or an interview within the context of a review of humanitarian and compassionate grounds, the applicant cites three decisions of this court. In
Chhokar v. M.E.I.
(1991), 43 F.T.R. 288 (T.D.), Walsh, J., found that
"The only such review, by exchange of letters without any interview, was far too casual and did not represent the full and fair consideration to which the applicant is entitled."
In
Vaca v. M.E.I.
(1991), 50 F.T.R. 10; 15 Imm. L.R.(2d) 315 (T.D.), Cullen, J., found that:
"[A] thirty-minute hearing covering all the material filed and hearing representations and explaining the purpose of the hearing and also the Illegal de Facto Resident's public policy, was not doing justice to the applicant, notwithstanding her offer to allow further written submissions that day."
And, in
Johal v. M.E.I.
(1987), 15 F.T.R. 164; 4 Imm. L.R.(2d) 105 (T.D.), he also found that;
"Much more should have been done than simply a few phone calls and a meeting between the two immigration officers. This was serious matter and the applicant was clearly entitled to a letter and/or an interview outlining the reasons his application was refused and an opportunity to reply to the alleged misrepresentations ... The applicant did not receive natural justice."
