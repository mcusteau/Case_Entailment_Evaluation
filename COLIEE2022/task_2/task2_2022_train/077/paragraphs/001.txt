 Zinn, J. 
 : The Applicant says that the Pre-removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) Officer rejected her application because he did not believe that she was lesbian. The Respondent says that the PRRA officer rejected the application because there was insufficient evidence presented to prove, on the balance of probabilities, that the Applicant is lesbian. If the Applicant is correct, then the PRRA officer ought to have held a hearing to determine her sexual orientation. If the Respondent is correct then no hearing was required.
