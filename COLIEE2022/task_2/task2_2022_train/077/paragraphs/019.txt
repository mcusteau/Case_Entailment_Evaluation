  The Court of Appeal, in the course of its reasons, engaged in a detailed and informative discussion of the concepts of burden of proof, standard of proof, and quality of the evidence necessary to meet the burden of proof, all of which I find to be very useful in the present case and which, in my view, ought to be kept in mind by PRRA officers when considering applications.
