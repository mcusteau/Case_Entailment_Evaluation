  Ms. Carrillo is a citizen of Mexico who sought refugee protection in Canada. She claimed that she had been abused by her common-law spouse and that her spouse's brother, a police officer, had helped her spouse find her when she hid after the beating. The principal issue before the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board was whether state protection was available to Ms. Carrillo in Mexico. Her refugee claim was dismissed by the Board. It found that she was not a credible or trustworthy witness with respect to her efforts to seek state protection in Mexico. Further, the Board held that had it found her to be credible, she had nonetheless failed to rebut the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. The Federal Court set aside that decision on the basis that the Board imposed too high a standard of proof on Ms. Carrillo regarding the lack of state protection. An appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal was allowed.
