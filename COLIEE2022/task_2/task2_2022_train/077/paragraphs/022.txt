  The standard of proof in civil matters and in administrative processes is the balance of probabilities. In this PRRA application the Applicant must prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be subject to risk of persecution, danger of torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Jamaica. That is proved by presenting evidence to the officer. In this respect the Applicant also has an evidentiary burden. The Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of each of the facts that has to be proved. One of those facts involves her sexual orientation. As will be discussed below, I hold that she did present some evidence of her sexual orientation and thus can be said to have met her evidentiary burden - she presented evidence of each material fact in issue.
