On May 4, 1992, the solicitor for the applicant wrote, and sent his letter by fax, to the Director General, Atlantic Region of PWC, to advise that he had been instructed to apply to the Federal Court of Canada pursuant to s. 44 of the
Act
for an order requiring that the records referred to in the letter of April 9 not be disclosed. The solicitor requested that no action be taken to disclose the material referred to until the matter is resolved by the court or by agreement of the parties, and he indicated that as soon as originating documents were filed they would be provided to the Department of Justice in Halifax. Application was then made under the
Act
pursuant to s. 44 seeking a review of the decision that the applicant's Proposal be disclosed.
