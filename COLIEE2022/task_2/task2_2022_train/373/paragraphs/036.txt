The major difference between the parties is whether the Proposal, and the Record, is "confidential information", that is by some objective standard, as required by paragraph 20(1)(b). For the respondent it is urged that a general statement by affidavit of Mr. Couture that the Proposal is "confidential" does not make it so for purposes of the
Act
and no other evidence is offered as to its confidential nature in an objective sense (see
Canadian Football League v. Canada (Minister for Fitness and Amateur Sports) and Shoalts
, [1989] 2 F.C. 480; 24 F.T.R. 62 (T.D.)). Yet there is other evidence before the court, that is the information itself, sealed with the confidential affidavits of Mr. MacCoul. The Proposal, and the Record, have been reviewed by the court, bearing in mind the standard for "confidential information" within paragraph 20(1)(b) as set out in
Air Atonabee Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Transport)
(1989), 27 F.T.R. 194, at p. 210 (T.D.), that is,
"(a) that the content of the record be such that the information it contains is not available from sources otherwise accessible by the public or that could not be obtained by observation or independently by a member of the public acting on his own;
"(b) that the information originate and be communicated in a reasonable expectation of confidence that it will not be disclosed; and
"(c) that the information be communicated, whether ... required by law or supplied gratuitously, in a relationship between government and the party supplying it that is either a fiduciary relationship or one that is not contrary to the public interest, and which relationship will be fostered for public benefit by confidential communication."
