The applicant filed an Amended Notice of Motion and a Supplementary Affidavit of Armand Couture in Court File T-916-92 on August 25, 1993. In its Amended Notice of Motion the applicant incorporates in its motion for a review, pursuant to s. 44 of the
Act
, the decision in regard to "a proposal submitted by the applicant to the respondent regarding the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project", in addition to the decision of the respondent Minister to disclose the Record as to "why the idea of a tunnel was dismissed in favour of a bridge proposal as one of the options to create a fixed link between P.E.I. and the mainland", as the original Notice of Motion provided. The Amended Notice of Motion seeks the same relief and sets out the same grounds as the original Notice filed in May 1992, but it refers to the affidavit of Armand Couture sworn the 24th day of August 1993, in support of the motion. The Amended Notice of Motion is dated August 25, 1993, the same day as it was filed.
