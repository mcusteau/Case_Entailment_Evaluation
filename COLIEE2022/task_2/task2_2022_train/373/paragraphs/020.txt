[20]
For the applicant it is urged that s. 44(1) is permissive and does not specify that an applicant must file an application for review within 20 days. The purpose of the limitation period is said to be to permit the Crown to disclose information after lapse of the 20 day period if a third party, who "may" apply for a review, has not done so. Thereafter the Crown may disclose the information in question without recourse by the third party who has not requested a review. The applicant urges, however, that if the information has not been disclosed by the time an application for review is filed, even if that be more than 20 days after communication of the decision to disclose it, the matter is still appropriate for the court to determine. In the circumstances of this case it is urged the court should review the decision. The respondent was advised by letter, within the prescribed period, that an application was to be filed under s. 44(1). The decision in question arises essentially from the same circumstances as the earlier decision, and it was made at about the same time, and here application was made to review the first decision concerning essentially similar information on the very day that the second decision, to disclose the Proposal, was received by the applicant.
