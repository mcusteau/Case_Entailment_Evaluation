As for the balance of the information in the Proposal I draw no conclusion that it should be exempt from disclosure. Insofar as it is original text, charts and drawings related to this project, there may be matters the applicant considers would warrant special consideration by the respondent, accepting the latter's obligation to release any information that can reasonably be severed from exempt information. Perhaps if an appeal is contemplated in this matter, counsel for the parties might confer about any portions of the information in question the disclosure of which particularly concerns the applicant. Fruitful discussion and possible agreement on limited portions that are exempt from disclosure might even avoid necessity for any appeal. Indeed, such discussions in advance of these proceedings might have resulted in a shared view of the application of the law concerning disclosure of information relating to third parties, and avoidance of any necessity for application to the court.
