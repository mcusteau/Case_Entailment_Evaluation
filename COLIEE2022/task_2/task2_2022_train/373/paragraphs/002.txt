In March 1988, Public Works Canada ("PWC") issued a proposal call for the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project, to construct "a fixed link" between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. In response to this call the applicant, as a participant in a joint venture, submitted a proposal in June 1988, consisting of six different volumes of documents, portions of three of which were duplicated in four other separate volumes. Subsequently, in August and September 1988, a further five volumes of documents were submitted, each described as a resubmission of a portion of the original proposal, intended to address deficiencies identified by PWC. The 15 volumes of documents are herein referred to collectively as ("the Proposal"). Each volume of the Proposal, except the last resubmission volume, contains at its beginning the following preamble on a separate page immediately prior to the Table of Contents.
"Preamble
This document is an integral part of the Proposal for the Stage II of the Northumberland Crossing Project and should be read in conjunction with all the other parts of this Proposal, as listed in the Index which follows.
The data, furnished in this document shall not be disclosed outside the Crown and shall not be duplicated, used, or disclosed in whole or in part for any purpose other than to evaluate the Proposal; provided, that if a contract is awarded to this offeror as a result of, or in connection with, the submission of this data, the Crown shall have the right to duplicate, use, or disclose the date to the extent provided in the contract. This restriction does not limit the Crown's right to use information contained in the data if it is obtained from another source without restriction."
The last resubmission volume includes a statement similar to the second paragraph of this Preamble, with the sentence structure varied and in somewhat different order.
