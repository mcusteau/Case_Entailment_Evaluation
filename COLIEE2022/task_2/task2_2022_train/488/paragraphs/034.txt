I agree with the respondent's submissions that the Refugee Division is not bound by a decision rendered by another panel of the same Division (
Kocab v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1991] F.C.J. No. 1057 (C.A.), A-83-91, October 15, 1991). Moreover, in a number of decisions handed down by the Federal Court, it has been held that judges sitting in review of a decision of the Refugee Division cannot consider the facts and conclusions drawn by the other panels of the Division in other cases. (See
Ahmed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1997), 134 F.T.R. 117 (T.D.).)
