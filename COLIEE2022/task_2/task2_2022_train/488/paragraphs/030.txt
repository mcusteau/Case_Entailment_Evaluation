[30]
In my opinion, the two contradictions cited by the Refugee Division, which I have discussed in paragraphs 27 and 28 of these reasons, are unreasonable since they are not based on the evidence. Notwithstanding this determination, I am satisfied that the decision does not warrant the intervention of this Court. I am satisfied, despite these errors, that the Refugee Division, as a result of the other inconsistencies, contradictions and improbabilities cited in its reasons, reasonably concluded that the applicant lacked credibility.
Did the Refugee Division err in drawing negative conclusions concerning the applicant's credibility in criticizing her, on the one hand, for not claiming refugee status in Russia while she was there in August 1999 and February 2000, while, on the other hand, the Division acknowledges that the applicant's son was justified in fearing persecution in Russia on the basis of his membership in the Caucasians as a Jew and Armenian?
