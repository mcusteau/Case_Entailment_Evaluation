The defendant challenges the plaintiffs' registered design on a number of grounds: the trolleys were not marked in accordance with s. 14(1) of the Industrial Design Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-8, and therefore, the plaintiffs are not entitled to the protection of the Act; the design was published more than one year before its registration in Canada; the trolley is an article which is not seen by the public, which serves a solely functional purpose, and therefore is not properly the subject of an industrial design registration; the defendant's trolley is not a copy of the plaintiffs' design.
