[39]
In this case, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs should not be granted an injunction because they knew about the defendant's infringing product months before they took action to try to stop the defendant from marketing the product. It is alleged that employees of the plaintiffs saw the "Organizer" bag at a trade show in Toronto on May 3 to 5, 1987. The Samsonite and Holiday booths were close to each other at that show; Holiday had the "Organizer" bag on display. A Mr. Palser, the representative of the plaintiffs, originally swore that Samsonite employees had not seen the bag. He asserted that if they had, they would have mentioned it and prompt action would have been taken to alert Holiday to the Samsonite claim. It was subsequently discovered that two Samsonite employees had seen the bag (a Mr. Fitzgerald and a Mr. Gifford). One of the defendant's employees recalled speaking to these two gentlemen at the show.
