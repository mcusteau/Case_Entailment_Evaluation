As noted above, the defendant argues that the plaintiffs' patent is invalid, that it involves no inventive ingenuity, and is obvious in light of the prior art. Counsel for the defendant relies on the expert evidence of Mr. Finchman and some fourteen prior art patents for his argument. Counsel for the plaintiffs objected to the expert evidence of Mr. Finchman on the ground that he was not a properly qualified expert. Mr. Finchman is a patent agent with training in organic chemistry. He does not have experience in the luggage industry, although he has some slight acquaintance with patents for that industry. In Cooper & Beatty v. Alpha Graphics Ltd. et al. (1980), 49 C.P.R.(2d) 145, at 164-165 (F.C.T.D.), the evidence of a patent agent was rejected. This was done, not because expert evidence on the ultimate issues of obviousness and anticipation was thought to be, per se, inadmissible, but because the patent agent was held not to have expertise in the relevant area. His expertise related to the construction of patents. He was not a workman skilled in the relevant art. Therefore his evidence on the issue of obviousness was rejected.
