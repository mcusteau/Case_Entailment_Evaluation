With respect to the first argument, I recently had occasion to refer to the unsettled nature of the law in this area in L.M. Lipski Ltd. v. Dorel Industries Inc. and Babytyme Products Ltd., (Court file number T-2493-87, decision dated March 31, 1988). With respect to the second point, there is no convincing evidence that such publication occurred. With respect to the third point, the fact that an article is purely functional does not mean that it cannot be protected by design registration. Indeed, the essence of good design is that there be a unity of form (appearance) and function. If the appearance of an article is
totally
dictated by the function it performs, then it may be that that article is not a proper subject for design registration. (It is difficult to conceive of such an article although certain types of machine parts may qualify.) In any event, for the purposes of this application, a consideration of the last point suffices. The test for the infringement of a registered design is "the eye of the court" (see pages 7 to 9 of the Lipski decision, supra). In this case, my preliminary assessment, without finally deciding the issue, is that it would be very unlikely that the plaintiffs will win in asserting that its design is infringed by that of the defendant. The two designs do not look at all alike. It is clear that the defendant has taken the plaintiffs' idea for a two track locking trolley; a trolley that will take ordinary hangers instead of those especially designed for use in luggage bags. It is equally clear, however, that the two trolleys are quite different in appearance (in design). I do not propose to compare them element by element for such is a tedious process. Suffice it to say that the nature of the trolley mechanism itself imposes certain constraints as to size and shape on the object. But, that being said, it is quite clear that the designs are different.
