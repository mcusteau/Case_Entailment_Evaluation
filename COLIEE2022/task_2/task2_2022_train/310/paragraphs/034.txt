In my view, this analysis is a bit oversimplified. The Patent Act is designed to give an inventor a monopoly over the invention for 17 years. An inventor is given the right to exploit the product in the market for 17 years, free of competition. With such a right goes more than the mere right to sell the product; it includes the right to sell the product at a price free of competition, except from the next closest
noninfringing
product. What the nongranting of an interlocutory injunction imposes on the holder of a valid patent right is competition in the market place with respect to the invention (and thus, in all probability, sales at a lower price) for the duration of the litigation. This as noted above, can exceed the commercial life of the product.
