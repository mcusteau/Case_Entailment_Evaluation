In the Cutter case, the plaintiff claimed infringement of a patent for a multiple blood bag system. In both the patented and the defendant's system, the tube leading to the blood bag was sealed off by a plastic membrane, and an unattached piercing device was situated in the tube near the membrane. In the patented system, the piercing device was a free moving, unattached cannula (hollow tube). In the defendant's system, the piercing device was a pointed, vaned spike, cruciate in its cross-section, which fitted loosely in the tube. It was held in place by friction against two small protrusion's on its opposing vanes until used to perforate the membrane. The court found textual infringement of the patent but also considered the issue of substantial infringement. The Federal Court of Appeal agreed with the trial judge who had found that the defendant's spike was the functional equivalent of the patentee's cannula:
"Both are operated by the technician in the same way. Both rupture the membrane and establish a channel or channels through which blood or its anti-coagulants can flow. Both do it in the same way ... Moreover, both devices are in the tube and are unattached. (page 199)"
The court then went on to find that the precise structure of the piercing device was not an essential element of the invention. The substance of the invention would be taken as long as the device had "the essential elements of being in the tube and being unattached".
