[46]
In the present case, the defendant is not seeking to have the file wrappers admitted for the purpose of construing the terms of the patents. Rather, it is sought to introduce such evidence merely to show what prior art had been before the patent examiner and what had not. This, it is argued, is relevant to the presumption that the patent is valid. (s. 47, Patents Act.) Counsel for the defendant tendered the patent file wrappers in this case for the purpose of demonstrating that the United States examiner had had before him, the three patents specifically mentioned above (Kish, Krynoski and Davis) and had disallowed claims 28 to 31 of the patent. It was noted that the Canadian patent examiner did not have these three patents before him when the Canadian patent was issued. Thus, I am asked to consider this evidence when considering the strength of the case the defendant must make to rebut the s. 47 presumption.
