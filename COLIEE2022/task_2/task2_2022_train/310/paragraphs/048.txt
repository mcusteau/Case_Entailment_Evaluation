I have concluded that an interlocutory injunction should not issue in this case. While the plaintiffs might be said to have a serious question to be tried, in the words of Mr. Justice Owen in the Baie James case, supra, the existence of the rights they assert appears doubtful. This doubt arises because it seems more likely than not that the defendant's garment bags do not constitute a substantial infringement of the plaintiffs' patent: the way in which they accomplish the purpose of keeping garments from bunching in the bottom of the bag is a materially different variation on the plaintiffs' patent. Also, the defendant's locking trolley does not appear to infringe the plaintiffs' registered industrial design.
