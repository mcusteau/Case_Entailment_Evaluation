In coming to this conclusion, I have looked closely at the decisions in Baxter Travenol Laboratories Ltd. v. Cutter Ltd. (1981), 52 C.P.R.(2d) 163, affirmed (1983), 68 C.P.R.(2d) 179, and at the Varta case mentioned above. In both those cases, there were physical differences between the infringing article and the patented article. The differences between the two, however, were minor when one looks at the overall functional operation of the patents in issue.
