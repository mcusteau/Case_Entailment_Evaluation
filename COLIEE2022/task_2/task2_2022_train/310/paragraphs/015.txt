There is no evidence as to whether the luggage covered by the prior art cited to me has or has not been manufactured and marketed. Some of it may have been, but as far as the evidence in this application is concerned, that evidence consists almost entirely of what counsel for the plaintiffs has described as old patents "grubbed up" from the patent office with 20-20 hindsight. As he says "the prior art has been sieved with claim 28". At the same time, it is clear that some of the features contained in the prior art patents are common knowledge (the use of straps to hold garments in a packed condition and thus avoid wrinkling; the use of stiff partitions in suitcases against which to fold garments such as shirts and suits). The particular combination of features found in the plaintiffs' patent, however, is not found in one place in the prior art and I am not convinced, on the basis of the evidence, that it would have been obvious to a workman skilled in the art to put together the particular combination which the plaintiffs have patented.
