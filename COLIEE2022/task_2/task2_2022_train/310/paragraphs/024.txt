I would note that the plaintiffs admit that s. 58 of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, applies with respect to 700 of the defendant's "Ultimate" garment bags (205 of which still remain in the defendant's hands):
"58. Every person who, before the issuing of a patent has purchased, constructed or acquired any invention for which a patent is afterwards obtained under this Act, has the right of using and vending to others the specific article, machine, manufacture or composition of matter patented and so purchased, constructed or acquired before the issue of the patent therefore, without being liable to the patentee or his legal representatives for so doing; but the patent shall not, as regards other persons, be held invalid by reason of such purchase, construction or acquisition or use of the invention by the person first mentioned, or by those to whom he has sold it, unless it was purchased, constructed, acquired or used for a longer period than two years before the application for a patent therefore, in consequence whereof the invention became public and available to public use."
