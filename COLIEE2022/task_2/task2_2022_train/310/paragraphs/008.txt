Mr. Justice Owen refers to interlocutory injunctions as being granted in "exceptional cases". It is clear from the context of his remarks, however, that he is not intending to add any additional requirement to the usual considerations relevant in determining whether an interlocutory injunction should be granted. While reference is occasionally made, in the jurisprudence, to interlocutory injunctions as "extraordinary remedies", I have not been able to find any elucidation of this concept in that jurisprudence. It may be that the characterization of interlocutory injunctions as "extraordinary" is primarily a reference to the historical origin of the remedy in the courts of equity. In that context, the remedy was developed for cases where the "ordinary" common law remedies were inadequate; the remedy was in this sense, clearly "extraordinary". This perception is reflected in Maitland's description of equity as "supplementary law", and "a sort of gloss written round our code" (F.W. Maitland, Equity: A Course Of Lectures, revd. by J. Brunyate (Cambridge, University Press, 1936 at p. 18). In terms of a modern day context, to the characterization of interlocutory injunctions as "extraordinary", I can only give that characterization meaning by concluding that it refers to the fact that in granting an interlocutory injunction, that order may determine the rights of one of the parties to the proceedings, to the detriment of the other (if only on an interim basis) with less than a full hearing of the evidence having occurred. Perhaps in that sense such orders are "extraordinary".
