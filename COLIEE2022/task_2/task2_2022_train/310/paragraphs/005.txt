Since the decision by the House of Lords in American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd., [1975] A.C. 396, at 405-409, there seems to have been considerable uncertainty as to when an applicant, in seeking an interlocutory injunction, need prove a "prima facie case" as opposed to a "serious question to be tried". Some decisions have treated the two tests as equivalents. Others see the test of a "prima facie case" as being more stringent than that of a "serious question to be tried". I recently had occasion to refer to some of this jurisprudence in L.M. Lipski Ltd. v. Dorel Industries Inc. and Babytyme Products Ltd., (Court file number T-2493-87, decision dated March 31, 1988, at pages 22-23). [See 19 F.T.R. 18]. Despite this uncertainty, both counsel agree, I think, that regardless of the verbal formulation in which the test is framed (prima facie case or serious question to be tried) what the courts in fact do, when faced with an application for an interlocutory injunction, is to adjust the demands for a strong case by reference to the irreparable harm (or balance of convenience) which will result from the giving or withholding of an injunction. Thus, if the plaintiff appears to have a strong case, he will be required to prove less by way of "irreparable harm" (or balance of convenience). If the plaintiffs' case is less strong, however, he will be required to prove more by way of "irreparable harm" (or balance of convenience). I agree with this analysis.
