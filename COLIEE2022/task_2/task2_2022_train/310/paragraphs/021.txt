I do not accept, however, the argument that the commercial success of the garment bag demonstrates, in this case, the inventiveness of the claims in issue, or their lack of obviousness. The patent under discussion and the garment bags being marketed by the plaintiffs contain three aspects: the corner compartments; the upperstraps and middle rod; the lower garment holding means and stiffened panel. Only one of the three aspects of the bag is in dispute in this application (the garment holding means and stiffened panel). I do not think the commercial success of the bag as a whole can be evidence of the inventiveness of one of the aspects only, unless there is explicit evidence to this effect. When more than one aspect of a product is involved, the commercial success of the whole may very well be due to one of the other of the aspects of the patent and not to that in dispute.
