Counsel for the plaintiffs seeks to have paragraphs 8 to 17 inclusive of Mr. Finchman's affidavit excluded on the ground that he does not have the requisite expertise. I have examined those paragraphs carefully. Mr. Finchman does not put himself forward as a person skilled in the art of luggage making or luggage designing. The paragraphs merely describe, in a summary form, the prior art patents appended to the affidavit. Mr. Finchman's affidavit, in this respect, is being used as a vehicle to place the prior art patents before the court, without drawing any conclusions respecting obviousness therefrom. I think the paragraphs are admissible for this purpose.
