 [6] 
  In my opinion: 
 
 
 
 a) The Minister was under no legal duty to consult with Mr. Provost before issuing the permit. However, if he had such a duty, that duty was satisfied; 
 
 
 
 b) In passing the resolution favouring a permit, the Band Council was acting as a federal board, commission or tribunal, and the resolution is subject to judicial review; 
 
 
 
 c) The Band Council was under no legal duty to consult with Mr. Provost before passing the resolution. However, if it had such a duty, that duty was satisfied; 
 
 
 
 d) Mr. Provost has standing to make the specific allegations set out in his applications; 
 
 
 
 e) Given the answers above, it is not necessary to consider whether the applications were timely; 
 
 
 
 f) In any event, should holdings a) and c) be wrong, nevertheless, the Court, in its discretion, should refuse to grant Mr. Provost any remedy.
