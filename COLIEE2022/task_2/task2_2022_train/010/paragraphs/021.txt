  During the more than two years from when his term of office expired until March 2009, he seems to be singularly unaware of ongoing discussions. In March 2007, approximately 600 notices of a proposed April meeting of the band were mailed to Piikani members living on the reserve within 800 metres of the project. In addition, AltaLink information packages were hand-delivered. Mr. Provost denies receiving the information package. He states he lived in unit 4B. AltaLink's Mr. Journeault, together with members of the band, was hand-delivering information packages. The list he had, which was prepared by the band, showed a unit 4A against which Mr. Provost's name appeared and a unit 4B with a question mark. Mr. Journeault checked off 4A meaning that he hand-delivered the information package to someone at that address. He cannot recall whether or not that person was Mr. Provost.
