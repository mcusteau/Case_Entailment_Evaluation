  The time cherished remedies of mandamus, certiorari, quo warranto, prohibition, injunction, declaratory and other relief lumped together in ss. 18 and 18.1 of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
  are discretionary in nature. Section 18.1(4) of the  
 Act 
  provides that the Court  
 may 
  grant relief. This is consistent with the whole history of prerogative writs and extraordinary remedies ( 
 Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band et al. 
 , [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3; 177 N.R. 325, at paragraph 30 and following, and 112).
