  Nine months later, Jordie Provost, a Band member, applied to this Court for orders setting aside both the permit and the supporting band council resolution. Broadly speaking, it is Mr. Provost's position that he was entitled to prior notice; that the Minister and the Band Council had a duty to consult with him, and indeed with the entire Band; that he was given no opportunity to make submissions or comments and that the Minister and the Band Council were obliged to consider the comments he would have made and to take them into account before deciding whether to pass a resolution and to issue the permit.
