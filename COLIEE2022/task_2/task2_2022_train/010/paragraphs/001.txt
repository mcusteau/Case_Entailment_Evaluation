 Harrington, J. 
 : AltaLink Management Limited has all the necessary Alberta and federal government approvals to construct a high-voltage electrical transmission line from Pincher Creek to Lethbridge. Because part of the intended route runs across the Piikani Indian Reserve No. 147, the necessary approvals include a permit from the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs and a band council resolution. The band council resolution consenting to the project was passed in June 2008 following which the Minister issued the permit the following month.
