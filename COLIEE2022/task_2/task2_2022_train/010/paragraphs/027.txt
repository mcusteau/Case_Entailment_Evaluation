  According to Mr. Provost, during the period from January 2007 until early 2009, the HVOTL project occasionally came up in conversations he had with other band members. Their discussions consisted of speculation about when the project might be constructed and what jobs might possibly be created. Yet, when in the course of one of these conversations in March 2009 he was told that the project was going ahead, he contacted band officers and was readily provided with a copy of the permit, a permit which had already been registered.
