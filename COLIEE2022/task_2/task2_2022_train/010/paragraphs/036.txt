  I find that the Chief and the Band Council were under no legal duty to consult with Mr. Provost. It may have been politically wise to do so. This is an elected Chief and Band Council who always face the revenge of the ballot box. The same overall reasoning which led to my conclusion that the Minister owed no duty applies to the band as well.
