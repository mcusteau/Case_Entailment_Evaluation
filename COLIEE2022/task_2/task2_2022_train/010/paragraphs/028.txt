  It is not contested, and indeed following the decision of the Supreme Court in  
 Opetchesaht Indian Band et al. v. Canada et al. 
  (1994), 41 B.C.A.C. 241; 66 W.A.C. 241; 41 B.C.L.R.(2d) 145 (C.A.), affd. [1997] 2 S.C.R. 119; 211 N.R. 241; 90 B.C.A.C. 1; 147 W.A.C. 1, it could hardly be contested, that the issuance of this right-of-way for 65 years or as long as required, even though subject to renewals, was of a temporary nature, so that the required approval was that contemplated by s. 28(2) of the  
 Indian Act 
 . The  
 Act 
  contains a number of provisions relating to the acquiring of interests in reserve land by non-band members. Section 28(2) requires consent of the band council. Other sections dealing with approvals are 20(2), 35, 37, 38, 53(1)(b), 58(1) and 58(3). Some specifically require a band membership vote, such as an absolute surrender of reserve land which, in accordance with s. 39, must be assented to by a majority of the electors of the band.
