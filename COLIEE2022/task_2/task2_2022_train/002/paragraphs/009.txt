  The Applicant said: 
 
 
 
 (i) That the Citizenship Officer noted that the Applicant had been in Canada for 1099 days, and that this notation constituted a decision that the days he declared had been accepted. He said that once his declared days had been noted, it was no longer open to the Officer to send him a Residence Questionnaire and it was not open to the Citizenship Judge to conclude that he had not met the residency requirement. 
 
 
 
 (ii) That the Citizenship Judge's decision as reflected in the Notice to the Minister of June 19, 2006 was inconsistent because it showed his time in Canada as 1099 days (which was over the required minimum of 1095 days) in the bottom box in the group of boxes at the top right of the form, and yet, the Citizenship Judge ticked the box in Part I of the form which showed that he was not satisfied that the Applicant had complied with the residence requirements. 
 
 
 
 (iii) That, because counsel for the Respondent did not cross-examine him on his affidavit of May 29, 2007, which exhibited his passport, the Respondent by its inaction admitted that he was resident in Canada for 1099 days. 
 
 
 
 (iv) That he was unfairly treated because the Citizenship Judge did not tell him what documents and explanations were needed to establish residence.
