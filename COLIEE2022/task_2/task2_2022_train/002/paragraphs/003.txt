  In my view, the question of whether an applicant for Citizenship meets the 1095 day residency requirement in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act is a mixed question of fact and law in which fact finding is the predominant task. The specific issue in this case is credibility and it calls for a deferential approach. However, less deference is suggested by the provision for an appeal, by the fact that the inquiry is focused on the Applicant, and by the fact that the Citizenship Judge does not possess relative expertise.
