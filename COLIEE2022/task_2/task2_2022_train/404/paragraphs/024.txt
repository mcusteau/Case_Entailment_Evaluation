Further, as regards natural justice the court concurs in the view of Strayer, J., in
Latham v. Canada (Solicitor General) et al.
, [1984] 2 F.C. 734 (T.D.), when he wrote at p. 744: "In determining the requirements of fairness in any given situation I believe it is necessary to consider what the nature of the consequences is for the person who has allegedly been denied fairness." The applicant submitted that he suffered and is still suffering significant hardship because of his detention in a maximum security institution for nearly a year, together with allegations relating to his case with a view to a parole application. However, in its decision the NPB did not consider the fact that the applicant is still in a maximum institution, but rather his [TRANSLATION] "attitude ... and personality traits", as a result of which he experiences [TRANSLATION] "frustration still and reacts negatively to the case management team" (p. 7, Exhibit R-2). Moreover, the applicant made his transfer application barely five months after his transfer to Donnacona, a transfer which he requested himself (Exhibit I-5).
