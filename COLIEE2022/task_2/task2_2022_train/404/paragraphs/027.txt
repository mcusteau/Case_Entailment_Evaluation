However, as the British Columbia Supreme Court indicated in
Bachynski v. Gallagher et al.
, July 27, 1995, Victoria 2533/95, B.C.S.C., at pp. 14-15:
"Prison authorities must act on the best information available. Sometimes it is unreliable and an individual inmate is wrongly charged or wrongly transferred. But given the nature of the inmate population and the necessity of preserving order there is often no other alternative. If a dangerous person is allowed to remain in the general prison population of a medium security institution, it is the other prisoners and staff who suffer the consequences because they have no place else to go.
"Perhaps the Petitioner was not dealt with perfectly. But, the law does not demand perfection. This is because the system is run by human beings. Very rarely do any of us perform anything perfectly. Courts must always be vigilant in protecting the individual rights of an inmate who is dealt with in an unreasonable manner. On the other hand, we should realize the difficult situations that confront prison officials."
