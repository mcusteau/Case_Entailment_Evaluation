[3]
The applicant has always maintained he was not involved in an escape conspiracy. He referred to the affidavit by Claude Véronneau, an inmate also involved in an escape conspiracy with importation of a firearm into Leclerc in December 1994. A guard at the institution conspired with Mr. Véronneau to import the firearm (Exhibit CV-2). The latter alleged that the applicant [TRANSLATION] "had absolutely nothing to do with that incident" (see applicant's file, p. 25). As appears from Exhibit CV-1, Mr. Véronneau's affidavit was accompanied by a statement written in February 1995. These documents were filed in support of the application for judicial review on March 7, 1996, following an order by Pinard, J. In reply the respondent filed an affidavit by Normand Morin, a Preventive Security Officer at Leclerc (see respondent's file, pp. 72-74). Mr. Morin submitted that the escape conspiracy incident involving the applicant, and involving the importation of a nine mm firearm and contraband referred to in the PSR of January 31, 1995 (Exhibit I-4), is a separate matter from the one referred to by Mr. Véronneau in his affidavit. The incident to which Mr. Véronneau referred involved the delivery of a 22 calibre firearm, loaded with bullets, not a nine mm firearm.
