The question is whether an adequate alternative remedy exists which the applicant should have used before applying to the court for a prerogative writ to issue. A good summary of the applicable principles and the general rule of exhaustion was given by Stone, J., in
Lewis v. Canada Employment and Immigration Commission
, [1986] 1 F.C. 70; 60 N.R. 14 (F.C.A.) (hereinafter "
Lewis
"). According to Stone, J., when a statutory or internal remedy exists the decision to grant a prerogative remedy of certiorari is discretionary. He said the following, at p. 96:
"It is clear on the other hand that the alternative remedy must be adequate in the eyes of the law, else the discretion may be exercised in favour of the applicant. In deciding whether an adequate alternative remedy exists (and hence that the remedy of the certiorari should be denied), the courts are required to consider a number of relevant factors."
