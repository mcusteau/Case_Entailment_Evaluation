Settlement offers not accepted by the Court as falling within Rule 420 should nevertheless be considered under Rule 400:
Remo Imports Ltd. v. Canada Jaguar Cars Ltd.
, [2006] F.C.J. No. 902; 2006 FC 690, at para. 14. However, as the defendant points out, even in the case of settlement offers that do qualify under Rule 420, a doubling of costs is the default unless otherwise ordered by the Court. It is therefore quite unlikely that a Court would order more than this amount, where the requirements of Rule 420 are not strictly met.
