The other disputed disbursement item is a claim for photocopies. Dimplex initially claimed $45,982.77 including GST at an in house rate of $.25 per page. CFM proposed a reduction by $13,981.08 to reflect a commercial rate of $.14 per page and removal of an additional $3,993.47 for what it considered unnecessary copying. Dimplex accepted the latter reduction but not the former. While I appreciate that a claim for in-house copying should reflect the actual costs incurred, I note that Assessment Officer Stinson has concluded that $0.25 per page is reasonable and would defer to his considerable experience in these matters:
Canadian Union of Public Employees, Airline Division, Local 4004 v. Air Canada
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 464; 157 F.T.R. 186 (T.D.), at para. 7. I did not consider it necessary to take this dispute into account in arriving at a lump sum award as the amount to be awarded will in any event fall well short of Dimplex' actual costs.
