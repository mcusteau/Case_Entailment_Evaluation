CFM acknowledges that Dimplex is entitled to reasonable party and party costs. It submits that Column III is only meant to be departed from in the rarest of cases. CFM also objects to any award of counsel fees for attendance at related U.S. proceedings. It had been agreed between the parties that the depositions of the inventors in the parallel action in the U.S. would serve for both purposes and a consent Order was issued to that effect. Dimplex submits that Canadian counsel participated in those depositions and it should be entitled to recovery for those costs. In the circumstances, that is a reasonable proposition as Dimplex's Canadian counsel had to be prepared to rely upon the U.S. depositions in this action.
