As noted by the Court in
AB Hassle
, above at para. 15, success normally entitles a party to costs, not increased costs. As noted by the Court in
Aird
, above at para. 6: "[a]s a general rule, costs should follow the event. Absent an abuse of process, a successful plaintiff should not be penalized simply because not all the points advanced by the plaintiff have found favour with the court". The Court found in that case that as the issues in the action were not complex, the matter was mainly factually driven, and the fact that the plaintiffs were successful in relation to all but two
subsidiary issues
, the defendant's success on those two issues was not a significant enough reason for the Court to depart from this general rule (at para. 9).
