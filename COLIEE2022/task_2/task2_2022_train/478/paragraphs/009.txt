That being said, as noted by the Court of Appeal in
Consorzio Del Prosciutto Di Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc.
, [2003] 2 F.C. 451; 297 N.R. 135; 2002 FCA 417, at paras. 8-10:
"8 An award of party-and-party costs is not an exercise in exact science. It is
only an estimate of the amount the Court considers appropriate
as a contribution towards the successful party's solicitor-client costs ...
"9 ... the objective is to award an appropriate contribution towards solicitor-client costs,
not rigid adherence to column III of the table to Tariff B which is, itself, arbitrary
. Section 400(1) makes it clear that the first principle in the adjudication of costs is that the Court has 'full discretionary power' as to the amount of costs.
In exercising its discretion, the Court may fix the costs by reference to Tariff B or may depart from it.
Column III of Tariff B is a default provision. It is only when the Court does not make a specific order otherwise that costs will be assessed in accordance with column III of Tariff B.
"10
The Court, therefore, does have discretion to depart from the Tariff, especially where it considers an award of costs according to the Tariff to be unsatisfactory
. Further, the amount of solicitor-and-client costs, while not determinative of an appropriate party-and-party contribution, may be taken into account when the Court considers it appropriate to do so. Discretion should be prudently exercised. However, it must be borne in mind that the award of costs
is a matter of judgment as to what is appropriate
and not an accounting exercise." (Emphasis mine)
