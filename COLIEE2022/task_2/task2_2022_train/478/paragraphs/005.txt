In its initial submissions, Dimplex requested that its legal fees be assessed on the basis of Column V of Tariff B from the commencement of the action to the date of its first formal written offer to settle dated March 28, 2005, and thereafter on a solicitor-client basis for a total of $1.2 million. In the event that the Court was not persuaded that solicitor-client costs were warranted, Dimplex alternatively proposed that its legal fees be fixed on a party and party scale in accordance with Column V of Tariff B until March 28, 2005, and that the fees be tripled from March 28, 2005 to the end of trial for a total of $500,000. In each case, the disbursements claimed amounted to $400,000.
