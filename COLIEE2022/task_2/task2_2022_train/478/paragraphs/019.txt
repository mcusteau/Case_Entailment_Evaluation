The defendant's argument regarding the punitive damages claim and its call for a reduction in the plaintiff's cost award by at least 25% as a result is an issue that is appropriately considered in the context of this factor, but, in my view, not persuasive. The fact that the plaintiff won in regards to validity and infringement, but lost with respect to its punitive damages claim is relevant but not an indication of divided success. The punitive damages claim was subsidiary to the main issues of validity and infringement at trial and on those the plaintiff was completely successful. It was also reasonable for the plaintiff to attempt to make the case for punitive damages although I concluded that the evidence fell short of meeting the Canadian test. That being said, I had no difficulty finding that the infringement was deliberate.
