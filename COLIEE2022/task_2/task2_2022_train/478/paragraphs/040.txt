By virtue of s. 37(1) of the
Federal Courts Act
, the law of Ontario relating to interest on judgments is applicable to this case. Section 129(1) of the Ontario
Courts of Justice Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-43 (
Courts of Justice Act
), would seem at first impression to indicate that interest should be calculated from the date of the order fixing the costs rather than from the date of the trial judgment. However, the section has been interpreted as requiring that interest on costs be payable from the date of judgment rather than from the date of assessment. I note that under paragraph 130(1)(c) of the
Courts of Justice Act
, the Court has a discretion to allow interest for a period other than that provided under s. 129(1).
