The present motion is brought by Dimplex pursuant to Rule 403 of the
Federal Court Rules
, SOR/98-106 (
Federal Court Rules
). At the hearing, both parties agreed that a lump sum approach to fixing the costs in this matter would be appropriate. In my view also, that would be a reasonable disposition in the circumstances of this case.
