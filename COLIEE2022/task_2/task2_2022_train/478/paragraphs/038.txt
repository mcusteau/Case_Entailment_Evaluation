This is not a case in which I would award solicitor-client costs as the defendant's conduct while deserving of censure was not so reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous as to justify them. For that reason, I was satisfied that general damages or an accounting for profits would act as a sufficient deterrent. I find that a lump sum award approximating party and party costs at the high end of Column V without tripling but with a premium would be appropriate in all of the circumstances of this case.
