As I have indicated, my initial reaction, taking the statement of claim as a whole, was that there were sufficient particulars. Given the substantial written submissions, I have worked through the statement of claim to consider again whether it is deficient on its face as to particulars. This further, more detailed consideration really entails considering whether there are sufficient particulars to meet the applicable English
White Book
(The Supreme Court Practice) functions required of particulars, which in the 1988 edition are set out at p. 287:
(1) to inform the other side of the nature of the case they have to meet as distinguished from the mode in which that case is to be proved ...
(2) to prevent the other side from being taken by surprise at the trial ...
(3) to enable the other side to know what evidence they ought to be prepared with and to prepare for trial ...
(4) to limit the generality of the pleadings ...
(5) to limit and define the issues to be tried, and as to which discovery is required ...
(6) to tie the hands of the party so that he cannot without leave go into any matters not included ...
which functions were approved by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Gulf Canada Ltd. v. Tug Mary Mackin and Sea-West Holdings Ltd.
, [1984] 1 F.C. 884; 52 N.R. 282 (F.C.A.). However, I have kept in mind that there is a distinction between particulars needed before pleading and those needed before trial, the former required so as to intelligently plead and the latter, much broader, being any particulars required to properly prepare for trial: see for example
CAT Productions Ltd. v. Macedo et al.
(1984), 1 C.P.R.(3d) 517 (F.C.T.D.), at pp. 519-520.
