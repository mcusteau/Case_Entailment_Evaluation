The word "including" generally, but does not always, enlarges the scope of enumerated items: see for example
Dilworth v. Commissioner of Stamps
, [1899] A.C. 99 (P.C.), at pp. 105-106. In other instances the use of the word "including" may extend scope, but not, I believe, to an indefinite and unnatural extent.
