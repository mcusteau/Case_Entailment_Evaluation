[17]
Paragraphs 13 and 14 of the statement of claim set out the use of the defendant's
Pneumocort
trademark in Canada in respect of drugs for the treatment of inflammation and asthma, and that
Pneumocort
brand products are for the treatment of pulmonary disease. These
Pneumocort
brand products are, as in the case of the plaintiffs'
Pulmicort
brand products, prescribed by physicians, dispensed by pharmacists, and administered by those in health care to patients, or administered by patients themselves.
