In June 2008, the Department of Veterans Affairs denied the Applicant's claim to a pension based on hearing loss. The Entitlement Review Panel (the Panel) affirmed that decision in July 2009, having examined the results of the audiograms conducted during the Applicant's military service as well as those conducted in February 2008 and April 2009. Both decision-makers found that the evidence demonstrated that the Applicant had normal hearing while he was in the military. Moreover, the Applicant failed to establish that his current hearing loss resulted from the 1981 artillery round detonation or from prolonged exposure to noise while he was in the infantry and the military band.
