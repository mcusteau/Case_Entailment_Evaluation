In the instant case, the Applicant first raised the issue of his hearing loss in 2008-almost 13 years after his release from the military-when he applied for a disability pension. The Applicant needed to adduce sufficient credible evidence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the hearing loss he suffers today was directly related to his military service. In the Board's view, the Applicant did not adduce sufficient evidence to establish that link.
