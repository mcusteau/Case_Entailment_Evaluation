The Applicant also alleges that the denial of a pension for both his hearing loss and his back problems is a breach of his rights under s. 7 and 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part I of the
Constitution
Act
; 1982
, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (
Charter
). However, the Applicant does not develop his argument on
Charter
issues and it is difficult to see how he can bring his case within the scope of these
Charter
sections.
