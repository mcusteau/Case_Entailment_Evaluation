Justice Teitelbaum's decision in
Cundell v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 38; 180 F.T.R. 193 (T.D.), is helpful with respect to Dr. Lalonde's letter. In that case, which is a judicial review of a rejected pension claim, the medical expert reported that the cause of the applicant's injury was "unclear" and that it was impossible to say if military service contributed to the applicant's injury. Justice Teitelbaum observed as follows:
"59 It may be a fact that the etiology of sarcoidosis is unclear but what is not 'unclear' is that all x-rays of the applicant before he went to the Persian Gulf showed no problem with his lungs and
upon return or soon thereafter
, the x-rays of the applicant's lungs show the sarcoidosis." (my emphasis)
