I add here that the test as set out in
Law
was recently affirmed by the Supreme Court in
R. v. Kapp (J.M.) et al.
, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 483; 376 N.R. 1; 256 B.C.A.C. 75; 431 W.A.C. 75; 2008 SCC 41, where the Court stated:
"14. Nearly 20 years have passed since the Court handed down its first s. 15 decision in the case of
Andrews v. Law Society of British Columbia
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 143.
Andrews
set the template for this Court's commitment to substantive equality -- a template which subsequent decisions have enriched but never abandoned.
. . . . .
"17. The template in
Andrews
, as further developed in a series of cases culminating in
Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497, established in essence a two-part test for showing discrimination under s. 15(1): (1) Does the law create a distinction based on an enumerated or analogous ground? (2) Does the distinction create a disadvantage by perpetuating prejudice or stereotyping? These were divided, in
Law
, into three steps, but in our view the test is, in substance, the same."
