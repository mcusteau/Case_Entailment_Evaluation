In summary, then, it appears to me that the s. 21(3) presumption is not engaged unless causation is established. Mr. Lunn has failed to show causation. The fact that Dr. Lalonde's letter is inconclusive does not assist Mr. Lunn, as there is no evidence that his hearing was damaged in the service, no evidence that his back injury was significant and persisted after physiotherapy (in fact, the evidence is to the contrary) and no evidence that his back and hearing health was anything less than "normal" when he left the military.
