In
Bernier v. Canada (Procureur général)
(2003), 230 F.T.R. 89; 2003 FCT 14, Justice Blais observed, at paragraph 32ff, that, for the plaintiff to be entitled to a pension, two conditions must be met: first, the veteran's condition must be pensionable, i.e., a disability resulting from injury or disease; and, second, the original condition must arise from, or be aggravated by, the veteran's military service:
"32. ... Thus, causation must be established, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the presumption found in s. 21(3) of the
Pension Act
allows for causation to be presumed if the injury was incurred during the course of the veteran's service.

"35. In
Hall v. Canada (Attorney General)
(1998), 152 F.T.R. 58, [1998] F.C.J. No. 890, Reed, J., stated:
'[19] ... While the applicant correctly asserts that uncontradicted evidence by him should be accepted unless a lack of credibility finding is made, and that every reasonable inference should be drawn and any reasonable doubt resolved in his favour, he still has the obligation to demonstrate that the medical difficulty from which he now suffers arose out of or in connection with his military service; that is, the causal linkage must be established.'"
