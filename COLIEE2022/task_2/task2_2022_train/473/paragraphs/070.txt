The relevant provisions of the
Act
do not create a pension scheme based upon membership in the Canadian Forces. The legislation requires a causal connection between the injury and the performance of military service. This means that the Board is required by Parliament to consider the circumstances of the injury and to assess the strength of the causal connection between the injury and the Applicant's military services.
