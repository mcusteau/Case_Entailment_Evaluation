Shore, J.
: The art of active listening and seeing is inherent to each case heard by a first instance tribunal decision-maker. A credibility assessment necessitates a discussion in respect of the evidence; it is divided between subjective and objective evidence; neither of which was effected with enough elaboration. The matter of state protection may, in fact, be most pertinent but it would also require development, even if, in the most modest of terms. This does not imply the need for a lengthy decision but at least a few succinct sentences clearly addressing both the credibility issues and the state protection matter. Unequivocal analysis in terms of subjective and objective evidence is not only desirable but essential for a decision to be considered adequately reasoned or motivated.
