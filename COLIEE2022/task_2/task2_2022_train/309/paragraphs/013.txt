In respect of the credibility and plausibility of Ms. Myle's testimony, Ms Myle does not appear to have visited the United States; this does not appear in the transcript. It also does not appear that her children in the United States are living with their father; from the testimony, it appears that the father is no longer alive and that the children were living with an aunt on the father's side until recently.
