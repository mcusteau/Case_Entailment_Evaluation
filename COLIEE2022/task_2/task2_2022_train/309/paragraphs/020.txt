The Federal Court, in
Mayeke v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration)
, [1999] F.C.J. No. 758; 167 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.), at paragraphs 13-14, said that the Board must take into account the effects of a traumatic experience on claimants and added that confusion in an applicant's testimony could be explained by trauma:
"Moreover, in concentrating on events subsequent to the rapes the tribunal ignored the effects that such an experience might have on the plaintiff. The guidelines issued by the Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board are relevant:
'Women refugee claimants who have suffered sexual violence may exhibit a pattern of symptons [sic] referred to as rape trauma syndrome, and may require extremely sensitive handling.'
"In particular, difficulty in concentrating and loss of memory are included in the list of symptoms. In the case at bar the contradictions noted deal essentially with incidents involving the escape (for example, the persons who were in the jeep at the time) and the confusion could be explained by the trauma caused by the rapes."
