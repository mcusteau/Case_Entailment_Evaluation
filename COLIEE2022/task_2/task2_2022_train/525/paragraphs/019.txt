In this case, the Adjudicator considered that the existence of a disciplinary investigation, and the fact that the applicant had been suspended without pay, was sufficient to give him jurisdiction over the matter under paragraph 209(1)(b) of the
PSLRA
. However, the Adjudicator did not consider, as he is directed to by the jurisprudence, whether the employer's intention, in suspending the applicant, was to punish him. Rather, it appears that the Adjudicator merely considered that, due to the length of time the investigation was taking, the suspension became disciplinary by default. Therefore, I conclude that this is a serious error, as the Adjudicator applied the incorrect test, which is sufficient in itself to warrant the intervention of this Court. I must point out that I come to the same conclusion whether I apply the standard of correctness or that of reasonableness discussed above. Nevertheless, I intend to consider also the third issue.
(3) Did the Adjudicator err when he concluded that the respondent's grievance was justified?
