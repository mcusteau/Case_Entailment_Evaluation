The parties have pointed to jurisprudence which comes to different conclusions concerning the standard of review applicable to the question of an adjudicator's jurisdiction. In
Canada (Attorney General) v. Shneidman
, [2007] F.C.J. No. 707; 365 N.R. 285; 2007 FCA 192 (C.A.), Justice Sexton conducted a pragmatic and functional analysis (according to
Dunsmuir
, supra, now referred to as a standard of review analysis), and concluded that the question of the PSLRB's jurisdiction is a pure question of law which merits no deference. According to Justice Sexton, although the PSLRB has considerable expertise concerning labour relations, this expertise does not extend to the interpretation of the
PSSRA
. However, in
Archambault v. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 108; [2005] F.C.J. No. 229; 2005 FC 183, affd. [2006] N.R. Uned. 112; [2006] F.C.J. No. 207; 2006 FC 63, Justice Layden-Stevenson concluded that, when the jurisdictional question is purely factual, such as when it involves an assessment of whether an action was disciplinary or not, the appropriate standard of review is patent unreasonableness.
