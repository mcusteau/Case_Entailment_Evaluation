From this excerpt, it appears as if the Adjudicator considered the lack of charges of obstruction of justice or mischief to be determinative on the question of misleading the police. However, the Adjudicator does not seem to have taken into account the evidence that the applicant had told the police that he did not know the complainant, while a DNA test demonstrated the opposite. This suggests that the respondent actually provided the police with false information. While the Adjudicator did consider that the evidence on this issue was second hand or double hearsay, the Adjudicator at no point decides to give this evidence no weight. Therefore, the Adjudicator should have addressed this evidence, which directly contradicts his conclusion.
