Concerning this letter, and the applicant's interaction with the police, the Adjudicator notes:
"[51] There is no direct evidence before me of a duty of Mr. Basra to cooperate with the police or of his failure to do so. It appears that Mr. Brown is confused as to the information from the Crown counsel. The letter from the Crown counsel disclosed that Mr. Basra did not give his correct name to the complainant, but there is no evidence of that [sic] he misled the police. ...
"[54] ... Mr. Brown said that another substantive factor [in his application of the
Larson
criteria when he reassessed the applicant's suspension] was that Mr. Basra did not cooperate with the police. It appears that for a portion of the investigation, Mr. Basra provided a false name and that certain facts were refuted or denied in the face of physical evidence against him. Mr. Brown was concerned that the police were concerned about a lack of cooperation and forthrightness. ..."
