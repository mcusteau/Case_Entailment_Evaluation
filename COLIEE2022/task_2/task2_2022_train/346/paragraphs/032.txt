Mr. Kenneth McLeod, counsel for the Sucker Creek First Nation, Ronald Willier and Russell Willier, argued that the application for judicial review of the suspension decision should be dismissed because it is moot. It is not moot if the subsequent decision by the respondents to remove the applicants is set aside on judicial review. Then the Court would be left to decide whether the original decision to suspend the applicant was valid. In any event, even if the first matter was moot, the Court sees an importance for the parties in having the suspension matter resolved to settle an important legal question between the parties which remains pertinent.
