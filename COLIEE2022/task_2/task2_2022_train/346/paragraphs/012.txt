The applicants state that the Band Council Resolution was not presented at the meetings of July 23 and August 7. All Council members were present at the July 23 meeting. At that meeting the applicant Paulette Campiou read into the record a number of jurisdiction objections to the meeting on behalf of herself and the applicant George Prince, including objections based on the lack of a petition seeking their removal, and the fact that the Special Meeting had not been convened by Council. After the applicant Paulette Campiou stated that she wished to have her lawyer present, all of the Council agreed to adjourn the meeting to August 7.
