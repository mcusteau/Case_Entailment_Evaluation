On April 7, 2008 I heard the motion by the applicants for an interlocutory injunction prohibiting the respondent Sucker Creek First Nation from suspending them as Band Councillors pending the outcome of this judicial review application. On April 15, 2008 I delivered my Reasons for Order and Order that the interlocutory injunction will be granted. I held at paragraph 35:
"¶35. The applicants have shown that the democratic process and their constituents will be irreparably harmed should the injunction not be granted. To begin with their suspensions are indefinite, meaning that no definitive time table has been established concerning the investigation into the allegations against them. Only one year and 8 months remain in the applicants' term of office. Each month is important.
"¶36. Accordingly, the balance of convenience favours the applicants, their constituents and the democratic process. The concern over the alleged conflict of interest can be addressed by suspending the applicants' duties with respect to the ATCO contracts until the investigation has been completed."
