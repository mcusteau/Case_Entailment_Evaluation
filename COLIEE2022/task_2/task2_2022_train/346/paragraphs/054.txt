Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band et al.
, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3; 177 N.R. 325; 122 D.L.R.(4th) 129, Chief Justice Lamer listed several factors that may be considered in determining whether there is an adequate alternative remedy:
"Â¶37 ... I conclude that a variety of factors should be considered by courts in determining whether they should enter into judicial review, or alternatively should require an applicant to proceed through a statutory appeal procedure. These factors include: the convenience of the alternative remedy, the nature of the error, and the nature of the appellate body (i.e., its investigatory, decision-making and remedial capacities). I do not believe that the category of factors should be closed, as it is for courts in particular circumstances to isolate and balance the factors which are relevant."
