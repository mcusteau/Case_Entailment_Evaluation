Between July 23 and August 7, 2008, counsel for the applicants requested particulars of the allegations against the applicants, specifically which alleged facts constituted which of the alleged breaches. The applicants state that counsel for the Band refused to provide particulars, replying that the applicants knew the allegations against them and that these were contained in the affidavit sworn by Chief Jaret Cardinal in the application for the interlocutory injunction that came before me in April 2008.
