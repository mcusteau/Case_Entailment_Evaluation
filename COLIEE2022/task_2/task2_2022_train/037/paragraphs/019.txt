  In  
 Hinzman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 ) [see footnote 6], the Court cited ( 
 Canada Attorney General v. Ward 
 ) [see footnote 7] for the proposition that in refugee law, there is a presumption of state protection: 
 
 
 
 ...nations should be presumed capable of protecting their citizens. Security of nationals is, after all, the essence of sovereignty. Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, such as that recognized in Lebanon in  
 Zalzali, 
  it should be assumed that the state is capable of protecting a claimant.
