  While it undoubtedly would have been preferable for the RPD to provide a more fulsome analysis in support of its state protection conclusion, the Applicant provided the RPD with little to work with that was personalized to his particular profile and experience. At the time the Applicant came before the RPD, he was in his mid-twenties. He had been a resident of Trinidad for virtually all of his life. He feared his father who had acted out violently against his mother, against himself and his brother and against his mother's children by her second marriage. That being said, he had not lived with his father since 1990, he had not sought state protection since sometime in the 1980s, and he had thrice left Trinidad and voluntarily returned.
