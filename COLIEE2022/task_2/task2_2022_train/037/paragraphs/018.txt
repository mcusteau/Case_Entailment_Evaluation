 [18] 
  In  
 Florea v. Canada 
  ( 
 Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 ) [see footnote 5], Justice Hugessen, in a one paragraph judgment, for the Court, wrote: 
 
 
 
 The fact that the Division [here the RPD] did not mention each and every one of the documents entered in evidence before it does not indicate that it did not take them into account: on the contrary, a tribunal is assumed to have weighed and considered all the evidence presented to it unless the contrary is shown. As the tribunal's findings are supported by the evidence, the appeal will be dismissed.
