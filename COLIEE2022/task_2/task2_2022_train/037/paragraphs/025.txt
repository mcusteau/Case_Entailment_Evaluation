  With great respect, counsel's reliance on the foregoing passage is misplaced. While, once again in an ideal world, it might have been preferable for the RPD here to explain why it found the situation of the Applicant's mother and her children by her second marriage to be different from that of the Applicant, the reasons for doing so, I am satisfied, are obvious: the Applicant was in his mid-twenties when his application for protection came before the RPD; his mother was obviously substantially older and her children by her second marriage were infants; and the Applicant's mother and her infant children were substantially more vulnerable than the Applicant, particularly in a nation where spousal violence and violence against children is prevalent and sometimes regarded as an internal family matter. The Applicant was not economically dependant on this father. Quite possibly, the Applicant's mother and her young children were before they fled to Canada. The Applicant could be presumed to be able to be better take care of himself and, in circumstances where he could not, to be competent to seek out state protection. In short, the profile of the Applicant's mother and her young children was simply dramatically different from that of the Applicant.
