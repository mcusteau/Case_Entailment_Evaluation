  At hearing, counsel for the applicant identified the issues on this application as standard of review, failure to consider an identified country of reference, the adequacy or inadequacy of the RPD's state protection analysis and the failure of the RPD to give weight to a Canadian refugee protection decision in favour of similarly situated individuals, namely the Applicant's mother and his siblings by his mother's second marriage. Apart from the issue of the standard of review, I am satisfied that all of the issues raised on behalf of the Applicant can be considered under the broad category of "adequacy of reasons".
