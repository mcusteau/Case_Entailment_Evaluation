On August 5, 2005, I heard counsel for both parties by way of teleconference. They provided me with an update on the situation of the Applicant, and argued at full length the proper role of the removal officers, and in particular whether and to what extent they should take into consideration the best interests of a child whose parent is to be removed from the country. At the end of the hearing, I ordered the stay to be extended until such time as I could rule on it definitively. After having reviewed and considered the submissions of both parties and the situation of the Applicant, I have now decided that the stay should be granted. The following are my reasons for that order.
