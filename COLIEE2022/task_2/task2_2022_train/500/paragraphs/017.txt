Her counsel sent a letter to the enforcement officer, Mrs. Farrauto, on May 31st, 2005, asking for a deferral of the Applicant's removal scheduled for June 3, 2005. She argued that the Applicant, if she must leave Canada, wanted to take the children with her as they would suffer severe hardship if separated from her. She explained that another lawyer was seeking an order for the Applicant to have sole custody of the children, and that the father was cooperating. She also indicated that the father was trying to obtain the children's birth certificates, so that they could travel with her.
