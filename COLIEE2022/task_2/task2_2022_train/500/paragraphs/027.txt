Mr. Justice Kelen has aptly summarized the law in the case of
De Guzman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1557; 257 F.T.R. 290 (F.C.A.):
"I have concluded that s. 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
codifies the common law canon of statutory construction that domestic law should be interpreted to reflect the values contained in international human rights conventions to which Canada has ascribed. In
Baker
, supra, the Supreme court held tat paragraph 70 that the human rights values in these international conventions 'help inform the contextual approach' which the Court should incorporate when interpreting statutes. However, s. 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
does not incorporate international human rights conventions as part of Canadian law, or state that they override plain words in a statute. Section 3(3)(f) of
IRPA
means that the conventions be considered by the Court as 'context' when interpreting ambiguous provisions of the immigration law (at para. 53)."
