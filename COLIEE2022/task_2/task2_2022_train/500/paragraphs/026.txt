There is no doubt that international treaties and conventions are not part of Canadian law unless they have been implemented by statute (see, inter alia,
Francis v. R.
, [1956] S.C.R. 618;
Capital Cities Communications Inc. et al. v. Canadian Radio-Television Commission et al.
, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 141; 18 N.R. 181). Nevertheless, it is now recognized that international human rights law may be used as an aid in interpreting domestic law, even if not formally implemented by statutes. This was clearly enunciated by Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dub√© in
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; 243 N.R. 22.
