On August 12, 2003, the Board denied Ms. Osagie's request to re-open the claim. The Board noted that two separate notices had been sent to the address noted on Ms. Osagie's PIF. The Board was not persuaded that neither notice was received by Mr. Jesuorobo's office before June 6. The Board further noted that even if Mr. Jesuorobo only received the notice on Friday, June 6, he had sufficient time to make other arrangements before the hearing scheduled for the following Monday. As a result, the presiding member was not persuaded that there had been a breach of natural justice, and the application to re-open the hearing was accordingly dismissed.
