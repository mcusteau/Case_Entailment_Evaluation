In the affidavit filed by Ms. Osagie in support of her application for judicial review, Ms. Osagie deposes, based upon information from Mr. Jesuorobo, that neither notice of the abandonment hearing arrived in counsel's office until Friday, June 6. Ms. Osagie also deposes that Mr. Jesuorobo was informed late in the day on June 6 by the Federal Court that an urgent stay motion for another client was scheduled to be heard at 9:00 a.m. on June 9, that is, at the same time as her abandonment hearing. As a result, Ms. Osagie says, at approximately 8:20 a.m. on June 9, forty minutes before the abandonment hearing was to commence, Mr. Jesuorobo faxed a request to the Board that the matter be adjourned until 12:30 p.m. that same day. Mr. Jesuorobo also left a telephone message for an Abandonment Proceedings Clerk.
