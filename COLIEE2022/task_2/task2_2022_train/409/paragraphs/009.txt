On July 4, Mr. Jesuorobo applied to have Ms. Osagie's claim for refugee protection re-opened. This application was supported by an affidavit sworn by Ms. Osagie on July 3, 2003. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Ms. Osagie was aware of what had transpired with respect to her refugee claim prior to that date.
