Mactavish, J.
: As a result of a series of errors on the part of her counsel, Blessing Osagie's refugee claim was declared to have been abandoned. Her motion to have her claim re-opened was then dismissed by the Immigration and Refugee Board. She now seeks judicial review of the Board's refusal to re-open her refugee claim.
