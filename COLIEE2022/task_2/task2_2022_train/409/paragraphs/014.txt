Mr. Jesuorobo submits that the Board's finding that he had sufficient time to make other arrangements before Ms. Osagie's abandonment hearing is "ridiculous". In his oral submissions, Mr. Jesuorobo stated that while the notice was received in his office on Friday, June 6, he himself was not made aware of the hearing until early on the morning on Monday, June 9. The problem with this submission is that there is no evidence before the Court to support it.
