  The respondent concedes that the amount of specialised schooling that the child may actually require may be limited only to a few years (in effect, to allow her to "catch-up" to children of her own age, and to adapt to her hearing impairment). The child's success in school thus far, evidenced in grade reports which were not before the Medical Officers, indicates that she has some intellectual capability. These grade reports may contradict the analysis provided to the Medical Officers that the child has "below average to borderline intellectual potentials" and that she requires education for a "physically and  
 intellectually 
  handicapped child" (emphasis added).
