  There is also no evidence that the Medical Officers misconstrued that the child was a dependent applicant, rather than an independent one [sic]. Nonetheless, an applicant's potential for economic and personal physical self-sufficiency may sometimes be a relevant factor in determining whether the applicant is medically inadmissible:  
 Wong v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1996), 34 Imm. L.R.(2d) 18 (F.C.T.D.);  
 Brar v. Canada (M.C.I.) 
  (T-2832-91, 20 December 1996, F.C.T.D.). It is only inappropriate for a Medical Officer to rely exclusively on the issue of self-sufficiency, in determination of whether a person's condition is likely to cause excessive demands on health or social services:
