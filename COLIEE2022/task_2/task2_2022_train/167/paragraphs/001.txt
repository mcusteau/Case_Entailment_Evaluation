 Wetston, J. 
 : The applicant, Antonio Cabaldon Jr., seeks review of the decision of a Visa Officer, dated August 21, 1996, denying him and his family admission to Canada as permanent residents, under s. 6(1) of the  
 Immigration Regulations 
 . The application was denied on the basis that the applicants' dependent child, Marian Aira Cabaldon ("the child"), suffered from a medical condition -- "severe hearing impairment with delay in speech development" -- which, in the opinion of two Medical Officers, would cause, or might reasonably be expected to cause, excessive demands on social services in Canada. As such, she fell into an ineligible class under s. 19(1)(a) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 .
