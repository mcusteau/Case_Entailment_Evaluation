  As the Medical Officers erred in their application of the test set out in s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the  
 Act 
 , the decision of the Visa Officer to exclude the applicants due to the child's medical condition shall be set aside. Accordingly, the application for judicial review is allowed. The decision of the Visa Officer dated August 21, 1996, shall be returned to a different officer for rehearing and reconsideration in accordance with these reasons.
