  The Supreme Court of Canada has indicated the Point-Claire factors and related jurisprudence commonly employed to resolve a dispute as to whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor are irrelevant in the face of an express statutory definition of "employee":  
 Canada (Procureur général) v. Alliance de la Fonction publique du Canada 
 , [1991] 1 S.C.R. 614; 123 N.R. 161. Reading the applicable provisions of the  
 RCMA 
  and  
 PSSR 
 , it is apparent that an individual will be deemed to be employed by the Mint for the purpose of the  
 PSSA 
  only on the date she or he is first paid full-time remuneration which is a charge upon the revenue of the Mint.
