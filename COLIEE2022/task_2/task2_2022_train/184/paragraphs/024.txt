  In coming to this decision, I find nothing to support the applicants' contention that the Officer was required to fetter her own discretion and rely solely on the CIRB decision as the basis for rendering the impugned decision. The CIRB was tasked with examining the interaction between subsection 18(3) of the  
 RCMA 
  and the definition of "employee" per section 3 of the  
 Code 
 . The CIRB concluded that the Mint is not limited from contracting out for the provision of work or services. Nevertheless, based on a complete examination of their working situation and relationship, certain individuals previously identified as "independent contractors" by the Mint were found to fall within the definition of "employee" for the purpose of the  
 Code 
 . Accordingly, they were to be included within the bargaining unit.
