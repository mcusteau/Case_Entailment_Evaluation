  The Officer also had before her other evidence suggesting the individual applicants were Pro-Fac employees. For example, the "Hire Information" forms indicated these individuals were hired by Pro-Fac to work on-site at the Mint under the Contract. The forms also described the individual applicants' terms and conditions of employment with Pro-Fac. Further, the Officer was provided Statements of Earnings and Deductions which indicate that the individual applicants were being remunerated by Pro-Fac during the Relevant Period. As evidenced by the Mint's letters of offer to the individual applicants (all of which were before the Officer), it is apparent these individuals were only appointed to positions at the Mint between 1999 and 2001 and not during the Relevant Period.
