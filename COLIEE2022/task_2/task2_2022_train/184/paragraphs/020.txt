  The applicants equally assert that the Officer's reliance on the existence of the Contract coupled with her failure to address the impact of the CIRB's decision, denied the applicants' rights to procedural fairness. Although the applicants contest the Officer's jurisdiction to embark upon her own independent investigation (thereby ignoring the findings of the CIRB), if such an investigation is found by this Court to be legitimate, the applicants argue the Officer must examine the indicia of employee status as articulated by courts and labour boards. The Officer's reason for rejecting the findings of the CIRB was merely the fact that the employees in question were initially retained under the auspices of a temporary agency or general contractor. According to the applicants, the absence of comprehensive reasons to explain a result that differs markedly from that of the CIRB requires the intervention of this Court.
