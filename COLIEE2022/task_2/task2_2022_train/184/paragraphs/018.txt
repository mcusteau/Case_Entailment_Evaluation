  However, unlike the proper interpretation of the word "salary" which is expressly defined in the  
 PSSA 
  and contains a very minimal fact-finding component, at issue in this case is whether the individual applicants are "employees" for the purposes of  
 pensionable service under the  
 PSSA 
 .  
 This is a highly fact-specific determination 
 . To that extent, the question is more adequately characterized as  
 one of mixed fact and law 
  (and not one of pure law) which merits a standard of review of reasonableness (see  
 Estwick et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2007), 319 F.T.R. 290; 2007 FC 894, at para. 80 ( 
 Estwick 
 );  
 New Brunswick (Board of Management) v. Dunsmuir 
  (2008), 372 N.R. 1; 329 N.B.R.(2d) 1; 844 A.P.R. 1; 2008 SCC 9, at para 47).
