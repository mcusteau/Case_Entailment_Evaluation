  In conclusion, in accordance with the statutory scheme described in sections 17 and 18 of the  
 RCMA 
  and section 27.1 of the  
 PSSR 
 , the five individual applicants only became "employees" for the purposes of the  
 PSSA 
 , when they were appointed  
 and 
  remunerated by the Mint. It was thus, not unreasonable for the Officer to conclude that these individuals should not have their dates of becoming a contributor to the  
 PSSA 
  amended retroactively to include the Relevant Period.
