  Of particular relevance to the case at bar, is the portion of CIRB's decision with respect to those employees identified as "independent contractors" on the list (the List) of positions in respect of which the Mint and PSAC were in disagreement. The CIRB noted the certification order for the bargaining unit included all regular and casual employees except those excluded. Accordingly, even "employees" within the  
 Code's 
  definition working at the Mint on a casual basis should be included within the bargaining unit. The CIRB's decision does not provide an exhaustive analysis of how the  
 Pointe-Claire 
  factors apply to the employees described on the List as "independent contractors". Nevertheless, the CIRB finds "On the basis of the evidence before the Board in the present matter, those individuals numbered 2, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18, 20, 22, 29, 31 and 32, all were employees within the bargaining unit at the [time they were notionally employed by Pro-Fac]."
