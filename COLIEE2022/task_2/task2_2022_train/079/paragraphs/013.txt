  The Applicants submit that section 48 gives a removals officer discretion to decide when a removal order will be enforced (Applicants' Reply at para. 2). If a long-standing H&C application has not been determined due to backlogs, then, the Applicants contend, a removals officer may use this as a basis to exercise her discretion to defer removal (AR at p. 76). The Applicants also submit the deferral requested is for a specific purpose and to a specific time, when the outstanding H&C application will be determined (Applicants' Written Submissions at p. 78).
