  It is vitally important for this Court to orient itself chronologically when reviewing decisions of this nature. In this case, it is important to remember that the Court is reviewing a decision made in August 2009, not April 2010. Had this decision been made last week, it may have been more reasonable to defer removal for a few short months until the Applicants' long-standing H&C application was considered; however, at the time this decision was made the Applicants were requesting a deferral of nearly a year which may have weighed against their chances of receiving a deferral in the absence of truly exceptional circumstances.
