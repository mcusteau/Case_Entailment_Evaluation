 [23] 
  In the case of  
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 the Supreme Court of Canada held that the standard of reasonableness is "concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility with the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
