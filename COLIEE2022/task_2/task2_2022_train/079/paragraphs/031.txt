 [31] 
  Several aspects of the removals officers' role are noted in the above two paragraphs. It is clear that removals officers ought to examine the best interests of the child when deciding whether to defer the removal of parents. In doing this, the focus should not be on the children's ultimate best interests, but instead on their best interests in the short-term. In determining the short-term best interests of the child, care is to be taken to ensure that the exercise undertaken by the removals officer does not duplicate the analysis performed by the immigration officer considering an H&C application. The examples given by Justice de Montigny consist of deferral to enable completion of studies or to ensure that adequate care has been arranged if children are not going to accompany their parents. It is the Court's conclusion that the question of whether it is in the child's ultimate best interests to remain in Canada with his or her parents is a consideration to be analyzed at the stage of an H&C application and cannot be part of a decision to defer.
