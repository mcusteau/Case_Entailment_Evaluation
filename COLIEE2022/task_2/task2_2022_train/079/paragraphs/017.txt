  The Applicants submit the removals officer erred because she made no findings with respect to the impact of a removal on the children. The Applicants contend that the removals officer needed to make a determination as to what the children's best interests were, and then determine whether they were outweighed by other considerations. The Applicants also cite the case of  
 Kolosovs v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 165, 323 F.T.R. 181 and contend that a removals officer must be "alert, alive and sensitive" to the best interests of the child (AR at p. 82).
