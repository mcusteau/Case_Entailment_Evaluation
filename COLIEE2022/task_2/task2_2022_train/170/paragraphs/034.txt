  The evidence establishes that any use of the WRANGLER trademark by National was under licence from the respondent. Moreover, the respondent, as the party solely responsible for the manufacture, packaging, and labelling of the WRANGLER smokeless tobacco sold by National in Canada has necessarily direct control over the quality and character of the smokeless tobacco. Accordingly, the requirements of s. 50 are met and any use by National is deemed use by the respondent.
