  I note in passing that the Federal Court of Appeal's judgment in  
 Cartier v. Canada (Procureur général) 
 , [2003] 2 F.C. 317; 300 N.R. 362 (F.C.A.), on which the applicant relied, has no bearing on the standard of review applicable in the case at bar. In that case the Court of Appeal considered the function of the Appeal Division when it reviewed a decision of the NPB and the judge hearing an application for judicial review of the Appeal Division's decision. In that case, the original decision at issue was clearly within the expertise of the NPB, since it concerned the latter's assessment of the risk that an offender would reoffend if released.
