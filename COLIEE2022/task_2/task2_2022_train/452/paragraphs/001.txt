MacKay, J.
: By motion heard in Toronto on March 16, 1992, the applicant seeks a stay of removal proceedings that would give effect to a deportation order on March 23, 1992. The notice of motion was filed on March 12, the same day as an application for leave pursuant to s. 82.1 of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 as amended, for leave to commence an application for judicial review pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 as amended. In the application for leave is a request for an order in the nature of prohibition or for a stay restraining removal proceedings to effect the removal of the applicant from Canada until other relief sought in the application for leave, if granted, is fully considered. The separate motion for a stay seeks an order pending determination of the application for leave to seek judicial review and if leave is granted, until that application has been heard and disposed of.
