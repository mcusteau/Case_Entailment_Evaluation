[3]
At the time the application for a stay was heard the respondent was not prepared to respond to the application for leave and would not be in a position to do so prior to March 23, the date established at a meeting on March 2, for the removal of the applicant from Canada. In these circumstances, the court considered the application for a stay pending consideration of the application for leave to seek judicial review.
