A variety of issues are raised by the application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings, including issues of procedural fairness, alleged denial of natural justice or procedural rights contrary to s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
and s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, and alleged errors in matters considered, and failure to consider relevant matters, in connection with the decision on behalf of the respondent that insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds were shown to warrant interference with the deportation process. Those issues await consideration on another day in connection with the court's consideration of the application for leave to commence proceedings by way of judicial review. I accept the applicant's submission that the deportation order and this application for a stay of that order, is intimately connected to the relief the applicant seeks in its application for leave to seek judicial review. I do not, however, accept that if the applicant is deported, relief which he seeks, if subsequently granted, would be rendered nugatory. The application for leave may be considered in due course. If leave is granted and ultimately the orders sought are granted for certiorari in relation to the decision concerning insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds, and for mandamus directing reconsideration of the matter by the respondent, the applicant's interests in Canada, though he be abroad, are not beyond protection.
