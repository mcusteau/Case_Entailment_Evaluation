For purposes of considering the application for a stay I assume, without determining the issue, that the application for leave to seek judicial review does raise serious issues for determination by the court. That assumption may or may not prove warranted when the application for leave is considered on the basis of affidavit evidence and argument of both parties. I note that in this proceeding counsel for the respondent questions whether there is a serious issue in light of the absence of a statutory requirement for a humanitarian and compassionate review in this case, the lack of any requirement for oral interviews or representations or any requirement for reasons to be given. Again, those issues are to be determined another day, though I note that whether or not there be a statutory requirement for humanitarian and compassionate review of the applicant's case before deportation, where submissions concerning such considerations are made the Minister has an obligation to consider those (
Jiminez-Perez and Reid v. Minister of Employment and Immigration et al.
, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 565; 56 N.R. 215). In the discharge of that obligation the respondent must act in accord with the duty of fairness applicable by the common law and under the
Charter
