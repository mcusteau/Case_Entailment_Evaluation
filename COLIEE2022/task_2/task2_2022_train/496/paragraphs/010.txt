The applicant submitted that his hearing was held on October 7, 1993, the day after the national elections in Pakistan. The applicant argued that he was confronted with the fact that the P.P.P. had won the national elections but was never confronted with the fact that the P.P.P. had won the elections at the provincial level since this event had not yet taken place on the day of the hearing. In the applicant's submission, there was no evidence in the record to indicate that the P.P.P. had won the provincial elections. Accordingly, it was clear that at the time it made its decision the Refugee Division took into account a fact which occurred subsequent to the hearing. I agree with the applicant that the panel could not take this new documentary evidence into account without causing the hearing to be reopened and allowing the applicant to comment on this evidence, pursuant to s. 68(5) of the
Act
and
Lawal v. M.E.I.
(1991), 134 N.R. 33; 13 Imm. L.R.(2d) 163 (F.C.A.). It therefore erred on this point.
