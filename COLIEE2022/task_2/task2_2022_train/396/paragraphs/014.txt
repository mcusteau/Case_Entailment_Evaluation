I consider the nature of the respondent's decision-making power in s. 70(5) to be broadly discretionary. The language of "opinion" clearly denotes a legislative intent to provide the respondent Minister with a wide discretion to determine "danger to the public in Canada". Considering the discretionary nature of the decision under review, I am guided by the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Shah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 170 N.R. 238 (F.C.A.), where Hugessen, J.A., noted with respect to the burden on an applicant to demonstrate an error in the exercise of a discretion:
"To succeed in his attack here the applicant must show that the decision-maker erred in law, proceeded on some wrong or improper principle or acted in bad faith. It is a heavy burden ..."
I adopt the dicta of Hugessen, J.A., as it relates to this application. I consider the reviewability of this decision to be contingent on counsel for the applicant establishing that the decision-maker erred in law, acted in bad faith, or proceeded on a wrong principle. As Hugessen, J.A., noted, the burden on the applicant is a heavy one.
