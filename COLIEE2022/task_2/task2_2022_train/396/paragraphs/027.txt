In accordance with my responsibility under s. 18(1) of the
Federal Court Immigration Rules
, SOR/93-22. I provided the parties with the opportunity to make a request that I certify in my order that one or more serious questions of general importance arise in this application. I invited counsel to submit any possible questions for certification, for the purposes of enabling an appeal of my order to the Federal Court of Appeal. Counsel for the applicant submitted the following two questions for certification:
(1) Is the power granted to the respondent under s. 70(5) to form an opinion as to whether a person constitutes a danger to the public sufficiently precise to give adequate guidance for legal debate on the limits of such power and the determinative elements to such a finding?
(2) If so, what are the applicable sources from which the determinative elements or factors to be considered can be debated and applied?
Counsel for the respondent submitted that no question should be certified in this matter, as the standard of review has been determined by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Nguyen
, and this application merely deals with the manner in which that standard applies to the facts of this case.
