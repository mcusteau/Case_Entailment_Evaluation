[6]
This matter came on for hearing before me on 16 July 1996. I reserved my decision at the close of the hearing and invited counsel to make written submissions regarding a case that I cited to them during the hearing, and regarding certification of a serious question of general importance. The submissions received were contained in the Applicant's Supplementary Memorandum of Argument and Book of Authorities, which proposes a two part question for certification, and the respondent's further submissions.
