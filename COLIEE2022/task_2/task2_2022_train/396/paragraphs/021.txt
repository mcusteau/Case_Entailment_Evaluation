Counsel for the applicant argued that in determining the meaning to be ascribed to "danger to the public", a variety of considerations should be implied by the phrase, and these considerations could be gleaned from other provisions in the
Act
, such as the provision for detention in s. 103, and from other legislative provisions such as the bail provisions in the
Criminal Code
. In s. 70(5), Parliament chose not to narrow the scope of the respondent's discretion by a "reasonable grounds" standard or by specific factors to be considered. I am mindful of the fact that this has been considered by the Court of Appeal to indicate an intention on the part of Parliament to grant a wide discretion, and I find that it would be inappropriate, and wrong in law, to judicially impose criteria for consideration where Parliament has not. However, I am satisfied that the phrase "danger to the public" has a plain meaning, and I find that meaning to be a "present or future danger to the public". For the respondent to reach the opinion that a person constitutes a danger to the public in Canada, there must be some evidence of the person being a present or future danger to other persons in Canada.
