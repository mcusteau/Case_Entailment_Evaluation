Also sought on behalf of the applicant is an order directing the respondent to permit the applicant to return to Canada for the purposes of retaining and instructing counsel and to attend at the hearing of any appeal to the Appeal Division. It appears that this request is made in order to ensure compliance with an undertaking apparently made by counsel for the respondent at the hearing of the stay of removal application in January 1996. In my view, it is not for this court to enforce undertakings made on behalf of the Minister where there is absolutely no evidence that the undertaking will not be fulfilled, and I decline to make such an order.
