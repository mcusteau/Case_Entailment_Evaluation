He argued that a conviction for a serious offence, alone, should not be a sufficient basis for a danger opinion. Counsel cited
Salilar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1995] 3 F.C. 150; 97 F.T.R. 110 (T.D.), where MacKay, J., examining an adjudicator's decision regarding the detention of the applicant therein, found:
"... while in this case the criminal offences committed by the applicant were serious enough that he would not be a person admissible to Canada and therefore is subject to removal, yet the mere fact that he was convicted of those offences does not in itself result in a determination that he is likely to pose a danger to the public or even that he 'may' pose a danger to the public. ... The probability of such a danger has to be determined from the circumstances of each case."
It bears noting that this decision was made in a different context, that of review of an adjudicator's decision made under s. 103 of the
Act
, where the test is "likely to pose a danger to the public".
