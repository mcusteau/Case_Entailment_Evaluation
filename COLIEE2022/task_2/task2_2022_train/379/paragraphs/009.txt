The Board's reasoning in this case is difficult to follow. First, the Board seems to distinguish between a vendetta, or personal vengeance, on the one hand, and a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of being a member of a particular social group, on the other. The Board does not explain the assumption implicit in its finding that, as a matter of principle, a person who is the target of a private vendetta cannot claim to be persecuted by reason of membership in a particular social group. There is no explanation why, even if a person is only the target of a private vendetta, if the basis of the vendetta is the victim's race or any other Convention ground, the victim might not still come within the Convention refugee definition. In the absence of an explanation by the Board or some authority, as far as I am aware, there is no principle of law that provides that being the victim of a private vendetta and being a Convention refugee are necessarily mutually exclusive.
