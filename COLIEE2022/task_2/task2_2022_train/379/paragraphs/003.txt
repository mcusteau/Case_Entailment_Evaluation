The Board next set out the allegations of the Applicants. It made no findings of fact with respect to these allegations. The Kanun of Lek is a traditional custom in Albania that governs a number of things including marriage. It requires that a marriage must be approved by the bride's parents and that a type of dowry be paid to the bride's parents by the groom. The Applicants married without the approval of the wife's parents and without the payment of a dowry. As a result, the wife's family threatened to kill the Applicants.
