The Board considered the characteristics of a particular social group enumerated in
Canada (Attorney-General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321, at 739:
"1. Groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic;
"2. Groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and
"3. Groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence."
