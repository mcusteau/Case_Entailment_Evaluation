First, concern was expressed about the instability of the business location of the company. It had operated from several locations since its incorporations in 1981, and officers of the department believed on information provided by third parties that the company had been locked out of its leased premises in Milton with rental payments in arrears, and that the landlord of the Hillsburgh property had commenced action to evict Brough and thus the company, because of lease infractions. The evidence of Brough and Manchee is that while the company may have been locked out by the landlord of the Milton property, that was done at the end of the term of the lease which the landlord had earlier tried to have renewed. The evidence of Brough and Callighen was that any difficulties with the landlord of the Hillsburgh property arose over differences about landlord and tenant's obligations but in any event these had been resolved. Whatever the company's difficulties with its several landlords were, and implicitly whatever may have been the cause of departmental uncertainty about the company's address, these factors do not in themselves lead to any basis for concluding that delay would jeopardize collection.
