Any shares of the corporation were held by David Brough and Joni Manchee, though they appear not to have in vested, or at least not to have kept track of any investment, finacially in the company. They managed its operations on the basis of sales and by withdrawing little in wages or dividends. Initially both were officers of the company; for a time following a personal bankruptcy in 1985 Brough resigned as an officer. After resolution of relations between the two of them and of Manchee's withdrawal from the company, from late 1986 or early 1987 Brough was the sole officer and president of the company. By agreement between the two principals in October 1986 Brough was considered to have purchased the assets of the company, though apparently no corporate documents were executed as evidence of the intended transaction. By further agreements in 1987 certain continuing responsibilities were outlined between the corporation and Manchee, and between the corporation and Brough. By an agreement made in January 1988, Brough agreed to purchase the shares in the company which they deemed were held by Manchee who until then had been perceived as the major shareholder in the company. In March 1988, a vehicle originally registered in the name of the company and apparently purchased by it was transferred to Manchee. All of the agreements referred to were between Brough and Manchee, without execution of any documents on behalf of the corporation.
