Whether or not uncertainty about the company's address was warranted, the department did issue, in December 1987, addressed to the former address of the company, in Milton, notice of reassessment of tax liability of the company for the years of 1984, 1985 and 1986, claiming at that time a total in tax and interest arrears of more than $104,000. This notice and two subsequent collection letters in January and February, 1988 demanding payment, all apparently addressed to the company's former Milton address, were not received by the company or by Brough, though the letters were not returned to the department through the postal service.
