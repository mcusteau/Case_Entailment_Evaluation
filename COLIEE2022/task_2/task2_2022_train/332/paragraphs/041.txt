When one considers all these factors it seems to me that only two in combination could possibly warrant the conclusion that collection of the debt claimed by Her Majesty would be jeopardized by delay in collection processes. Those are that the one asset deemed by the department to be owned by the company which was of sufficient value to meet the debt, the Lake Renegade aircraft, might, in the circumstances of continuing instability of the company's operations, be wasted or transferred. It is an irony that Brough contends that the aircraft is deteriorating because of improper maintenance since it has been held by the sheriff's office. The instability of the company was not a new development in 1988, and in itself it would not warrant a conclusion of risk if collection be delayed. Nor would the fact that the company's assets are changed or reduced, in itself warrant such a conclusion unless there is a reasonable basis on the evidence to conclude that transfer of assets, which are not naturally wasting, has been or will be effected to avoid the claims of creditors including Her Majesty, or that the assets are likely to be moved out of the jurisdiction and beyond the reach of the department.
