The applicant, Satellite, is a corporation organized under the laws of Ontario in 1981. Apparently it was principally engaged in the manufacture, sale and servicing of Satellite dishes or instruments for reception of television or electronic signals, but its objects were not limited to these activities. By 1986 the corporation had encountered financial difficulties. Its place of business had been moved a number of times, the scale of its activities had been reduced, the relationship between the two principal players in the company was undergoing change, and some consideration was being given to alternative activities within the company's objects.
