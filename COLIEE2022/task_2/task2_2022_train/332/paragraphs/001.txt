MacKay, J.
: This matter, heard June 26, 1989, in Toronto, dealt with an application by the original respondent in this matter, the Satellite corporation, for return of an outstanding motion dated December 22, 1988, made pursuant to s. 225.2(8) of the Income Tax Act, as amended, for review and setting aside of an order originally made by this court on November 28, 1988. That order, granted on an ex parte application by the Crown, authorized the Minister of National Revenue to take any of the actions described in s. 225.1(a) to (g) of the Income Tax Act, including authorizing a designated sheriff to hold under seizure a 1984 Lake Renegade airplane belonging to the applicant Satellite. At the time of the hearing there was also outstanding in relation to this matter a motion of the original applicant, the Crown, to dismiss the original respondent's motion of December 22, 1988.
