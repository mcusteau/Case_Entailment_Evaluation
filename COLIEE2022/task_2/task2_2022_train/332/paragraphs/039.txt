The fourth general factor, implicitly underlying the department's action and developed in submissions of counsel at the hearing of this matter, was the instability of the company's operations from 1986 and particularly in 1988. By the latter year the company's operations had virtually ceased, and its cash receipts in the previous year were only about $15,000 as estimated by Brough. He professes that consideration was being given to other activities to be undertaken within the company's objects, in particular the production of documentary films for which use of the aircraft now held by the sheriff was crucial, and he points as well to grants available to the company to promote sales abroad, grants apparently available only to meet travel expenses if a representative of the company could travel within the terms of these grants. Despite continuing difficulties for the company, the department was able by the affidavit of Jang, to point to those difficulties being ignored or even misrepresented by Brough in applications for these grants. Efforts by Brough were unsuccessful in obtaining a letter of guarantee from a bank to meet the claims of the department if those were upheld following his appeal on behalf of the company because the company had been virtually out of business for two years.
