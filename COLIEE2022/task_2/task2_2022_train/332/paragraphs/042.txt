In this case considerable mistrust appears to have developed between department officers and Brough. Brough may well have appeared less than open and truthful in his dealings with representatives of the department and he may well have perceived the officers as less than fair and cooperative. From the perspective of each their mistrust may appear warranted, but it is unfortunate. It appears to have generated suspicion on the part of the taxation officers that Brough was simply seeking to evade payment of taxes deemed due from the company. That suspicion might have been inferred from the facts that those responsible for the company were aware of the audit and subsequent correspondence about liability of the company for past taxes and that assets of the company, which was already in some financial difficulty, were distributed between the principals in less than orthodox fashion. But there is not evidence, in my view, that would warrant this suspicion as a reasonable conclusion and suspicion in itself is not a reasonable basis for authorization to avoid delay in collection which s. 225.1 of the Act specifies as the normal case.
