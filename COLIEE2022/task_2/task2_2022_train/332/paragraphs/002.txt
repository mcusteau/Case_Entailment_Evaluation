The motion of December 22, 1988, was dealt with on January 9, 1989, at which time it was adjourned sine die to permit cross-examination on related affidavits filed. On March 13, 1989, the Crown applied by motion returnable on March 20 for dismissal of the December 22, 1988, motion and on March 15, 1989, the applicant filed an objection to the Crown's March 13, 1989 motion. On March 20, 1989, Rouleau, J., adjourned, sine die, the Crown's March 13 motion to dismiss the respondent's December 22, 1988, motion and, at the same time, dismissed an application by David Brough, the owner and principal officer of the applicant corporation, who is not a lawyer, to represent the applicant in these proceedings. On April 12 by motion returnable on April 24, 1989, the Crown applied once again to bring on and to dismiss the adjourned December 22, 1988, motion of the applicant. On April 24 the matter was further adjourned to April 26, but was not then dealt with again until April 27 at which time it was set over to May 29, 1989, but again, on that date it was adjourned sine die, returnable on the usual two days notice. Finally, by notice of June 22 the applicant again sought to bring forward the motion of December 22, 1988, and the matter was heard with consent on June 26, 1989.
