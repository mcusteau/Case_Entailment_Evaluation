Counsel for the Crown submitted that Ontario cases concerning an analogous process, a motion to rescind or vary an order granted on an ex parte application, provide a helpful precedent for dealing with applications under s. 225.2(8). Cases cited included Waites et al. v. Alltemp Products Co. et al. (1987), 19 C.P.C.(2d) 185 (Ont. D.C.), where Clarke, D.C.J., stated (at p. 190):
"A motion to rescind is not an appeal but a substantive motion. The question is not alone whether the order should have been made initially but, whether having been made, it should be set aside. ..."
Comments to similar effect are made in Re Avery, [1952] O.R. 192 (C.A.), and Cairns v. Airth et al. (1893), 16 Ont. P.R. 100 (Q.B. Div. Ct.). I do not accept the implication counsel suggested from these cases, that upon review the court must be satisfied that the order originally made was improper and, in addition, that the order ought now to be set aside. The cases cited do not support that proposition and such a process would be duly complicated, in my view involving aspects of an appeal and a hearing de novo.
