A review of the affidavits filed in support of the applicant Satellite and of the transcripts of cross-examination of affiants Brough and Manchee, the two principals responsible for operations of Satellite, leads me to two general conclusions. Satellite was a small, fledgling enterprise dependant significantly upon Brough and to a lesser extent Manchee, and at least in 1986 it was not operated on a very business-like basis in terms of records and the meeting of formal requirements. In these respects it may not be unique among small struggling enterprises. The first general conclusion is that, despite the less than tidy operations of the company, a number of the concerns raised by the taxation officers as the basis for the conclusion by Lee, the officer responsible, that delay would jeopardize collection are answered in a reasonable way by evidence offered in relation to the company's application for review. That conclusion led in May 1988 to action by the Minister in accord with s. 223 of the Income Tax Act, to the filing of the certificate and then to the issue of the writ of fieri facias. It was also the basis of the application on behalf of the Crown, made ex parte on November 28, 1988, for authorization by order of this court in accord with s. 225.2, as amended with effect from September 1988.
