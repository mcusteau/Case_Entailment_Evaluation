Thus, for example, comments relating to the need for the Minister to justify the order if the court is called upon to review the matter, made with reference to the former s. 225.2 are not directly relevant to review proceedings under s. 225.2(8) as enacted in 1988 for there is no provision now comparable to the previous s. (5) which specifically provided that in a review hearing the burden of justifying the direction was on the Minister. Moreover, under the current legislation any review proceedings initiated by the taxpayer relate to a previous order of the court authorizing exceptional action by the Minister, and not to a direction or order by the Minister himself.
