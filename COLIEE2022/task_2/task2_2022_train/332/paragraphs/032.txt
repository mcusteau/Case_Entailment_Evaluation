Brough who had apparently written to the Minister in the spring of 1987 from the Milton address of the company did not receive a reply although one was apparently sent in August. The Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise branch, wrote to the company at the Hillsburgh address in July 1987, so that at least another branch of the same department was cognizant of the company's address then. The company address had been provided to the telephone company. Taxation officers had telephoned Brough about company tax matters, at least once in April 1988, at the Hillsburgh address. There is evidence the department's taxation officers were not completely ignorant of the Hillsburgh address since part of the company's expenses in dispute for 1986 related to operations at that address.
