In April 1988 one of the department's officers telephoned the company at its Hillsburgh address. There is conflicting evidence about the conversation but agreement that on that occasion Brough did say that the company had done virtually no business for a year or more, and that its assets had been dispersed, without reference to where the assets had gone, i.e., largely to him. There is dispute as to whether anything was then said about taxes owed or about payment of taxes by the company. On May 10, as noted earlier, the department initiated legal action filing a certificate under s. 223, indicating taxes and arrears of interest in excess of $108,000 then owed, and obtaining a writ of fieri facias.
