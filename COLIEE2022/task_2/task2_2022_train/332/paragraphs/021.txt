In Laframboise v. Canada, supra, the first reported case to deal with s. 225.2 as it was enacted in 1985, Joyal, J., said, obiter,
"I would think that is incumbent on the Minister in exercising his executory powers under subs. 225.1(1) to limit the freeze to those assets which roughly equal the amount at risk. Again, the record is silent on this point.
"In such circumstances, I should very much hesitate at this stage to vary the Minister's direction, leaving it to the parties to make such adjustments as may be necessary so that the essential purposes of the jeopardy provisions are maintained and that the taxpayer, qua taxpayer, be otherwise capable of managing his affairs, whatever those affairs may be."
