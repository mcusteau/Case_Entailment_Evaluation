Finally, as part of the instability in the company's operations by 1988, the department appears to have been concerned about changes in responsibilities for the operations of the company, with the departure of Manchee, with whom tax officers had originally dealt, and the assumption of full responsibilities by Brough. Department officers only learned of these changes commencing in April of 1988. At the same time they learned that Brough had acquired in 1986 a so-called "green card" to permit him to work in the United States, and that he claimed some involvement in corporate activities in that country. In response, Brough's evidence is that the "green card" issued in 1986 merely replaced a card he had earlier held and had lost and that he had for some years done some work, claiming work for the applicant company, in the United States. In my view, whatever may have been the change in responsibilities for the company's operations, these were still principally influenced by Brough as they had been since the company's inception and there was no evidence that Brough intended to leave Canada to avoid company liabilities or to evade collection of taxes if his appeal is unsuccessful about the tax claims of the department.
