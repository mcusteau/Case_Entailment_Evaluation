 [23] 
  At the close of hearing, counsel were advised of the Court's conclusion and consulted on the issue of certification of a question. Neither counsel recommended certification of a question. The Court itself is satisfied that this application for judicial review turns entirely on its particular facts. No serious question of general importance arises that would be determinative on an appeal of the Court's decision herein. No question will be certified.
