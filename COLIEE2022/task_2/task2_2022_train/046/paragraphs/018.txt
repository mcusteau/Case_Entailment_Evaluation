  Counsel for the Applicant urged that, particularly taking into account the foregoing submissions, the evidence and submissions regarding the Applicant's marriage did not fit within either of the exceptions noted by the Officer and therefore were accepted by him or her and were therefore accepted as new evidence and were allegedly considered in the Officer's risk assessment. The foregoing notwithstanding, the evidence and submissions regarding the Applicant's marriage were no where specifically mentioned in the decision under review.
