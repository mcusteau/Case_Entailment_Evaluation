 Gibson, D.J. 
 : These reasons follow the hearing at Toronto on the 20th of May, 2010 of an application for judicial review of a decision of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer (the "Officer") wherein the Officer concluded: 
 
 
 
 "Risk by definition is forward-looking and the PRRA process requires that the risks faced by the Applicant be personalized. Based on a review of the current country documentation, I find that there has not been a material change in country conditions in Jamaica since the decision of the RPD [Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board] in May 2009, which would now bring the applicant within the definition of a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Further, I have been provided with insufficient evidence to demonstrate that the applicant faces additional, forward-looking personalized risks in Jamaica that were not contemplated by the RPD. 
 
 
 
 "Based on a review of the applicant's PRRA application and the publicly available documentation, I find that there is less than a mere possibility that the applicant faces persecution as described in section 96 of the  
 IRPA 
  [ 
 Immigration and Refugee Protection  
 Act 
 ], if returned to Jamaica. Similarly, there are no substantial grounds to believe that he faces a danger of torture; nor are there reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant faces a risk to life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment as described in section 97 of the  
 IRPA 
 ."
