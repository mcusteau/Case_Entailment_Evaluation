  The proximity of some relevant dates is worthy of note: the date of the Applicant's hearing before the RPD was the 29th of April, 2009, the date of the decision of the RPD is the 7th of May, 2009, the Applicant married on the 17th of July, 2009, leave on this application for judicial review of the RPD decision was denied on the 8th of September, 2009 and the decision here under review is the 6th of October, 2009. Thus, the opportunity for the development of "new evidence" within the scope of paragraph 113(a) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection  
 Act 
  [see footnote 1] (" 
 IRPA 
 ") was severely restricted.
