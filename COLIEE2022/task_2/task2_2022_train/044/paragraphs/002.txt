  The couple were accepted as refugees based on persecution because of their political opinion. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (RPD) found that Mrs. Brovina was not personally in any danger in Albania and, since her son and his wife were staying in Canada, she should have no difficulty upon her return. The board found that Mrs. Brovina was not politically active and, while she had received harassing calls for her son and had been present when her son's apartment was ransacked, she had not been personally targeted. With the successful claimants in Canada, Mrs. Brovina could safely return to Albania without fear of retaliation.
