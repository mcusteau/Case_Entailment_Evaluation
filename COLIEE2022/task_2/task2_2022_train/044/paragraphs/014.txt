  In  
 Kilic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2004), 245 F.T.R. 52; 2004 FC 84, Mr. Justice Mosley, at paragraph 27 stated: 
 
 
 
 "In my opinion, the Board in this case did not address the country documentation and other evidence related to prison conditions in Turkey and failed to consider whether the applicant could be a 'person in need of protection' if returned to that country, in light of the possibility that he may face a 'serious prison sentence' for evading Turkish military service. Despite the Board's negative credibility findings, a separate analysis, along the lines described in  
 Bouaouni 
 , supra, and having regard to the legislative wording of s. 97, may have produced a finding that Mr. Kilic was a person in need of protection. Therefore, the result of the Board's error is unknown, and accordingly, this application should be sent back for redetermination on this ground." 
 
 
 
 It is evident that in  
 Kilic 
 , supra, there was evidence that was not addressed under the s. 96 analysis that should have received s. 97 consideration.
