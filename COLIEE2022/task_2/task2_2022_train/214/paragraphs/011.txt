  The danger opinion concerning this applicant was based in large measure on the reports of correctional officers, the last of which is dated September 2002. The danger opinion was made in February 2003, yet not communicated to the applicant until October 2003, at the time of his statutory release from incarceration. There is no information on the record to explain this delay. Also, because of the date of the danger opinion, there is no information concerning the applicant's behaviour during the last year of his incarceration.
