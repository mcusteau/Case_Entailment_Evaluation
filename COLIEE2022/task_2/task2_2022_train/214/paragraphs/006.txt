  The minister's delegate supported her opinion with a rationale which weighed the danger factors of the applicant remaining in Canada against his fears of returning to Sudan: 
 
 
 
 "In coming to this opinion, I have weighed the following factors: 
 
 
 
 Mr. Koch Akuech fears return to the Sudan as he believes that other persons who were sent to Cuba disappeared after their return to Sudan. He also points out that he left that country when he was 10 years old so he does not know the country and has no support system there. Mr. Koch Akuech has been convicted of a very serious crime, sexual assault of a minor. He received a sentence of 3 years for this offence. 
 
 
 
 Mr. Koch Akuech has no family in Canada. He appears to have no support network in Canada. According to reports from his case management team at the institution, he has no firm action plan to follow upon release. He wants to go back to Brooks, Alberta, but the caseworkers are concerned that he will fall into the same pattern of drinking and partying with friends. Therefore, they are trying to encourage him to come up with a plan for release. In addition, they indicated that Mr. Koch Akuech has not adequately followed the recommended courses in sex offence. As an indication of this, full parole was denied to the offender. 
 
 
 
 It is true that Sudan does not have a good record in terms of human rights and there has been a civil war raging for many years. However, in July and October, talks in Kenya have been successful in coming to agreement on allowing human aid workers into the country and on allowing the south six years of self-rule before a referendum to decide whether or not it wishes to succeed. 
 
 
 
 On balance, I feel that the significant risk to the public in Canada must be given greater weight
