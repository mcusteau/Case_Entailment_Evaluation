  Paragraph 14 of Monsanto's proposed amendment also requires consideration. That paragraph is framed on the basis that the  
 "Commissioner would not have concluded" 
  something and  
 "would not be included" 
  something. So pleaded, these are assumptions and speculations as to actions that the Commissioner of Patents might have taken. The Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Operation Dismantle Inc. v. Canada 
 , [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441 at paragraph 27 warned against the pleading of assumptions and speculations: 
 
 
 
 27 We are not, in my opinion, required by the principle enunciated in Inuit Tapirisat, supra, to take as true the appellants' allegations concerning the possible consequences of the testing of the cruise missile. The rule that the material facts in a statement of claim must be taken as true for the purpose of determining whether it discloses a reasonable cause of action does not require that allegations based on assumptions and speculations be taken as true. The very nature of such an allegation is that it cannot be proven to be true by the adduction of evidence. It would, therefore, be improper to accept that such an allegation is true. No violence is done to the rule where allegations, incapable of proof, are not taken as proven.
