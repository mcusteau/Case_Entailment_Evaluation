  Counsel for each of Monsanto and Mycogen argue that, while they do not rely on section 73 of the post October 1, 1989  
 Patent Act 
  (dealing with the effect of changes to the Act) nor section 53 (dealing only with what is set out in the petition for the patent and the specification) there are at least common law provisions and section 30 of the  
 Act 
  which provides a basis for the relief claimed.
