With respect to price fluctuations, counsel for the defendant argues that the cost of the component parts varies from time to time and that since one can not trace exactly which component part went into which rower (or indeed into rowers as opposed to into other types of exercise equipment) one cannot establish the cost of the rowers with exactitude. Mr. Gayler's analysis of the cardex cards established average prices over the period of time in question. This is a reasonable and probable basis for establishing those costs. The defendant's objection is not a reasonable one.
