[56]
As has already been noted, in the circumstances of this case, it would be a mistake to parse Mr. Preston's accounting too closely. He was faced with a defendant who based its representations on an approach to semivariable expenses which Mr. Preston, rightly, did not accept. In many instances it is clear that no attempt was made by the defendant to bring forward an analysis of cost based on actual documentation even when it existed. For the reasons given, Mr. Preston's accounting of the profits payable by the defendant to the plaintiffs will be confirmed.
