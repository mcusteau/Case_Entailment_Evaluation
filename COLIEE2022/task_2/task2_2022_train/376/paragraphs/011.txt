Counsel for the plaintiffs also referred to Frank Music v. Metro-Goldwyn-Meyer (1985), 227 U.S.P.Q. 687 (C.A.F.C., 9th Cir.). While that case deals with the law of California, in my view, it aptly describes the law of this jurisdiction. I adopt the wording used by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. In establishing an infringer's profits, the plaintiff is required to prove only the defendant's sales; the burden then shifts to the defendant to prove the elements of cost to be deducted from the sales in arriving at profit. Any doubts as to the computation of costs or profits is to be resolved in favour of the plaintiff. At the same time, this does not mean that the infringer must prove expenses such as overhead and their relationship to the infringing product in minute detail. But the defendant bears the burden of explaining, at least in general terms, how claimed overhead costs actually contributed to the production of the infringing product.
