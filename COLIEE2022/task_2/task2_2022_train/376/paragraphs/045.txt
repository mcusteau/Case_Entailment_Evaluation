Mr. Preston was faced with the need to do an accounting based on Mr. Belbeck's, admittedly, incomplete analysis which relied on the financial statements and general ledgers of the defendant, or an accounting based on the defendant's base year approach, which approach Mr. Preston had rejected. In such circumstances it would be a mistake to parse his accounting too closely. The disposition made with respect to the specific cost categories will be discussed.
