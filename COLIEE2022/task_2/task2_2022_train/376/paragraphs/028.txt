[28]
In reviewing and assessing the evidence of the experts, Mr. Preston rejected Mr. Wiener's evidence on direct ancillary costs and accepted the plaintiffs' analysis. At page 34 of his reasons, Mr. Preston wrote:
"After a thorough consideration of Mr. Belbeck's [the plaintiffs' expert] evidence I am satisfied that, with the material he was provided with by the defendant, he carefully scrutinized the defendant's financial records, cost sheets, invoices and such other documents made available to him and using proper accounting principles for a differential assessment of the profits prepared his affidavit. His evidence was presented without bias and several times on cross-examination he made minor changes in his calculations after having considered the affidavit and exhibits filed by Mr. Wiener."
