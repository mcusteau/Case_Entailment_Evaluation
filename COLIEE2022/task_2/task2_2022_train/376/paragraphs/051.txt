Mr. Preston's accounting with respect to depreciation is a bit puzzling. He allocated under that heading a cost of $2400.00. This is the full cost of a strapping machine which he found to have been acquired by the defendant as a result of its production and sale of the convertible rowers. One can ask why he did not merely assess a depreciation percentage, or why he did not account for the machine's resale value at the end of the production period. In any event, the plaintiff is not contesting this allocation and therefore I am not prepared to depart from what Mr. Preston has recommended. I would note that the defendant put before Mr. Preston, a great quantity of evidence respecting a large number of machines which it alleged had been purchased for the purpose of manufacturing the infringing rowers. Mr. Preston saw and heard this evidence. He did not accept it.
