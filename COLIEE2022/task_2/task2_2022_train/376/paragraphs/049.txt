Mr. Belbeck recommended that no common costs be allocated to the infringing rowers on account of rent, machinery repairs and maintenance, factory expenses and depreciation. This recommendation was based on his view, at the time he prepared his affidavit, that the defendant had not demonstrated that any increase in these costs had occurred as a result of the production and sale of the infringing rowers. With respect to rent, Mr. Preston allocated $12,366.00 as a cost attributable to the rowers. He was persuaded, on the basis of the defendant's evidence, produced on the reference, that additional warehouse space had been leased in 1986 and that this had been required because of the production of the infringing rowers. With respect to machinery repairs and maintenance, as well as factory expenses, no amounts were allowed by Mr. Preston. Mr. Preston's decision is based on his finding that the defendant had not demonstrated that there had been any increase in these costs attributable to the production of the infringing rowers.
