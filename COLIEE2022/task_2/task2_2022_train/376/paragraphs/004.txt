While the differential approach is used in the circumstances mentioned above, there is no reason to assume that those are the only circumstances in which it may be appropriate. It is well-established, since the decision of Mr. Justice Addy in Teledyne Industries Inc. v. Lido Industrial Products (1982), 68 C.P.R.(2d) 204 (F.C.T.D.), that a differential or incremental approach is appropriate to determine an accounting of a defendant's profits in patent infringement cases. Mr. Justice Addy, discusses the rationale at pages 208-211 of the Teledyne case. At page 210, he referred to the differential method as being the proper approach to determine the profit added to an existing business, as the result of the establishment of a new product line. He quoted from the referee's report which was before him:
"(a) A business that is already operating sells a new product line. If management wanted to determine how much profit was contributed to its business by selling that new product, then such would be calculated by deducting from the revenue of that new product its variable costs and only that portion of fixed costs that increased as a result of selling the new product line. This calculation would not allocate any portion of the fixed costs that would have been incurred by the company whether or not it had sold the new product line."
Mr. Preston, the referee in this case, described the difference between the full cost and the incremental approach:
"In a full cost approach all indirect or fixed costs are allocated to a specific cost centre based on some rational foundation, whereas with the incremental cost approach you try to access what portion of indirect costs were increased as a result of the manufacture and sale of a particular product."
