The nature of the proof required, which respect to overhead expenses, was discussed at p. 694:
"We do not doubt that some of the defendant's claimed overhead contributed to the production of 'Hallelujah Hollywood'. The difficulty we have, however, is that defendants offered no evidence of what costs were included in general categories such as 'general and administrative expenses', nor did they offer any evidence concerning how these costs contributed to the production of 'Hallelujah Hollywood'. The defendants contend their burden was met when they introduced evidence of their total overhead costs allocated on a reasonable basis. The district court apparently agreed with this approach. That is not the law of this circuit. Under Kamar International, a defendant additionally must show that the categories of overhead actually contributed to sales of the infringing work ... We can find no such showing in the record before us. Therefore, we conclude that the district courts finding that defendants have established that these items of general expense [the general categories of claimed overhead] contributed to the production of 'Hallelujah Hollywood' was clearly erroneous."
