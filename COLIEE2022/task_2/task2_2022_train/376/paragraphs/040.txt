In 1985, the sales of noninfringing products decreased from 1984, whereas the sales of infringing products, as compared to 1984, increased. Therefore, Mr. Wiener concluded that the increase in expenses in 1985 as compared to 1984 were wholly attributable to sales of infringing units. Thus, 100% of the increase in semi-variable expenses were attributed to convertible rowers for that year. In 1986 and 1987, using 1984 as the base year, sales of the Homeware Division, excluding convertible rowers, increased as did the sales of convertible rowers. For those years, Mr. Wiener allocated a percentage increase in expenses, attributable to the infringing rowers, by reference to the criteria mentioned above. This led to an allocation of 54.97% and 16.25% of the increased expenses for the 1986 and 1987 years, to the infringing rowers. The defendant's method of cost allocation leads to an amount of $685,185.00 being attributable as common costs relating to the manufacture and sale of the convertible rowers. Mr. Preston allowed $298,422.00.
