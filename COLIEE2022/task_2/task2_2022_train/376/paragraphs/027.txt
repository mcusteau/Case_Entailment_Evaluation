This analysis raises many questions. The initial inadvertent inclusion of indirect labour costs in the calculation alerts one to the difficulty of comparing the two types of figures which are being used by Mr. Wiener. More importantly, however, the selection of only the 70% "best sellers" of the Homeware Division raises a host of questions about the appropriateness of the comparison which it is sought to draw on that basis. Mr. Wiener's analysis assumes that the ancillary costs for all of the products of the Homeware Division are the same. It assumes that each product bears a proportionate share of ancillary costs based on a percentage of sales. It assumes that the profit margin on the 30% worst sellers is the same as that on the 70% best sellers.
