The defendant's expert, Mr. Wiener, assesses the direct ancillary costs by taking figures from the financial statements of the company for the years in question and establishing thereby the net sales of the Homeware Division for all products sold by it. He then, determines, the costs of the goods sold by the Homeware Division. This calculation is done by adding together amounts shown on the general ledger for opening inventories, purchases and "direct" labour costs, then subtracting therefrom closing inventories. He subtracts the costs, thus determined from net sales for the Division and obtains a gross profit figure for the Homeware Division, for each of the years in question. From this, a figure for gross profits as a percentage of sales, for the Homeware Division, is calculated.
