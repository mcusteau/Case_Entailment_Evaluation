With respect to warranty repairs the plaintiffs calculated from the defendant's records the number of returns which occurred in 1986 and found that 1.8% of the units were returned. The plaintiffs' expert then assumed that warranty repairs would cost 20% of the original labour and material costs. Mr. Preston accepted that estimate in default of the defendants providing any more adequate assessment. In the circumstances, this approach cannot be faulted.
