When the percentages thus determined are multiplied against the net revenue figures for the infringing rowers for the years in question, in Mr. Wiener's view, the actual direct ancillary costs are thereby determined. The first step is to calculate: 46.51%-36.35%; 41.74%-33.05%; and 35.32%-28.29%. This gives 10.78%, 8.84% and 7.06% respectively. The second step is, then, to take: 10.28% of $1,261,807.00 for 1985; 8.84% of $3,090,916.00 for 1986; and 7.06% of $868,483.00 for 1987. When added together the ancillary costs are thus said to total $464,304.00. (Before the reworking of the figures to remove the indirect labour costs, the amount claimed by the defendant had been $705,138.00).
