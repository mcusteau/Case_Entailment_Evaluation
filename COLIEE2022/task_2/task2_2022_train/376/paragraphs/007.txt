In the present case, there has been no convincing reason given as to why a differential accounting approach is not appropriate. The infringing rowers were manufactured and sold by a division of the defendant, called the Homeware Division. That division, both before and during the time when it manufactured the infringing rowers, manufactured and sold a variety of other exercise equipment. The division itself is part of the larger diversified business enterprise of the defendant, Tye-Sil. Tye-Sil's other business interests include the manufacture and sale of gift wrapping, Christmas cards, Christmas decorations, paper tableware, lawn furniture and pressure sensitive vinyl products. The infringing rowers constituted 2.3% of Tye-Sil's gross sales in 1985; they constituted 7.5% in 1986 and 3.6% in 1987. As a percentage of the sales of the Homeware Division, the rowers constituted 20.4%, 28.6% and 9.2%, respectively, for the years in question. In general the infringing rowers were manufactured in the Homeware Division plants in Laurel (Orangeville) and Tottenham, Ontario. For three months in 1986, the manufacture of some Homeware products took place in Montreal, in the Tye-Sil division which usually makes lawn furniture. The production capabilities of that division were not needed for the production of lawn furniture at the time.
