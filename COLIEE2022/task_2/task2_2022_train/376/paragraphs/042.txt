With respect to the semi-variable costs, the defendant argues that it is very difficult to isolate the fixed portion of such costs from the variable component. Therefore, the base year approach should be accepted as a reasonable method of calculating the expenses. In my view, Mr. Preston was correct in rejecting that submission. The accounting of a defendant's profit will necessarily be somewhat inexact, whatever method of assessment is chosen. As between the defendant's approach and the plaintiffs', it is clear that, the latter results in a closer approximation to what is required for the purposes of an accounting of profits, in the present case, than does the former. In addition, there is no expert evidence that the defendant's method of calculating the share of semi-variable costs is an accepted accounting method.
