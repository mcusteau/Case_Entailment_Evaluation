The formula for calculating profits pursuant to the differential method is not in dispute. The profits are calculated by taking
the total of:
(i) all
sales revenue
(net sales) arising from the sale of the infringing product;
less:
(ii) any
direct costs
attributable to the production and sale of the infringing product, and
(iii) any
increase in common costs
specifically incurred to sustain the production and sale of the infringing products.
