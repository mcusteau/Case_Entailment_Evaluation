Direct costs were divided into those attributable to the purchase of materials and those attributable to labour. Mr. Preston assessed the direct material costs at $2,414,210.00 and the direct labour costs at $397,982.00. There is no dispute, before me, concerning the assessment of the direct labour costs. The defendant contends, however, that the direct material costs should be reduced by $75,936.00. At the same time, the defendant argues that a third category of direct costs, called ancillary costs, amounting to $464,304.00, should be deducted. It is argued that amounts attributable to export duties, $4,815.00, and certain destroyed inventory, $45,496.00, should also be deducted.
