Driedger
at page 177:
"If the provisions cannot both apply without conflict, the courts resort to one of the conflict avoidance or conflict resolution techniques at their disposal. These include (1) interpretation to avoid conflict; (2) the paramountcy of some categories of legislation over others; (3) implied exception (
generalia specialibus non derogant
); and (4) implied repeal. Of course, these interpretive strategies are subject to any express solutions provided by the legislature."
