In
Driedger on the Construction of Statutes
(3d ed.) by Ruth Sullivan, Associate Professor of Law, University of Ottawa, the learned author points out at page 176 that the presumption of coherence in a statute is virtually irrebuttable and the Courts must find some method to reconcile conflicting provisions.
"It is presumed that the provisions of legislation are meant to work together, both logically and teleologically, as part of a functioning whole.
. . . . .
"The presumption of coherence is also expressed as a presumption against internal conflict. It is presumed that the body of legislation enacted by a legislature does not contain contradictions or inconsistencies, that each provision is capable of operating without coming into conflict with any other.
. . . . .
"The presumption of coherence is virtually irrebuttable. Since disputes must be resolved by the courts in a definitive fashion in accordance with "the law", contradiction or inconsistency in the law cannot be tolerated; some method of reconciliation must be found. The courts have found a number of strategies to ensure this result."
