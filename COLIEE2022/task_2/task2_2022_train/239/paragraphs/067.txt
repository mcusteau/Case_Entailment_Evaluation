I am sensitive to the fact the information the applicant sought to have corrected in his files is dated in 1997 and that the CSC has a continuous process of reevaluating offenders. Indeed, a file correction relating to one item the applicant complained of here was made in the applicant's OSLRD file (see page 85 of the applicant's record) but this information does not seem to have been reflected in other files (see applicant's record, page 86).
