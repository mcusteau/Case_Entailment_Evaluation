On November 5, 1997, the applicant requested an outside review by the Citizens' Advisory Committee and focused on that part of the first level grievance where it was mentioned Mr. Wheeler had found the corrections he was requesting were not justified. The applicant wrote:
"I am totally in disagreement in that my request for correction of wrong information is - in this particular case - unjustified. Section 24(1) of the
CCRA
(
Conditional and Correctional Release Act
) states: 'The Service shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any information about an offender that it uses is as accurate, up to date and complete as possible.'
"Not only there has not been adequate effort, by the CSC staff, to establish the accuracy of information in my file(s), but also the subject matter of the information has been greatly exaggerated and misleading. Given that the alleged 'reliable information' from the Warkworth IPSO in my file(s) is purely fabricated, and there is absolutely no foundation in regard to the OCRDC allegation against me - as it is a pure speculation - Officer Wheeler's answer to my initial Complaint is not justified."
