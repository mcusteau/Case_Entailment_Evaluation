As to the March 12th incident, the applicant says the information which concludes he assaulted the other inmate is wrong; it was the other inmate who assaulted him. He adds he was not charged with assault and was found not guilty after a hearing, by the Discipline Court at Kingston Penitentiary, when none of the prison guards who had submitted reports appeared as witnesses. The applicant says he acted only in self defence. He is concerned with the use of that information and says it is being used in a manner prejudicial to him. He cites in his original complaint the belief held by his CMO the applicant had gone beyond self defence.
