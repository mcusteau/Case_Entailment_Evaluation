[63]
Under section 24 of the
Act
, the CSC must take reasonable steps to ensure that any information in an offender's files is as accurate, up-to-date and complete. For reasons given, I have found the specific information in the applicant's files which the applicant complained of do not comply with the standards of the section. The applicant requested correction but the CSC refused the request.
