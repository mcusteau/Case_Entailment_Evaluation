[61]
Paragraph 24(2)(b) provides "where the request is refused, the Service shall attach to the information a notation ...". Do these words preclude this Court reviewing the CSC's decision not to correct because the only remedy provided by the
Act
in such a case is a notation to be attached to the offender's file?
