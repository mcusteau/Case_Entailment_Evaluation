  There is considerable jurisprudence to the effect that only the evidence that was before the initial decision-maker should be considered by the court on judicial review [see footnote 2]. These decisions are premised on the notion that the purpose of judicial review is not to determine whether or not the decision of the Tribunal in question was correct in absolute terms but rather to determine whether or not the Tribunal was correct based on the record before it [see footnote 3]. Where affidavit material is clearly improper, the Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the material be struck out on motion previous to the hearing of judicial review [see footnote 4].
