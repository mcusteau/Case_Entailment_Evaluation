  In the instant application, the applicant does not claim that the Lachance affidavit is abusive or clearly irrelevant or contains opinions, legal arguments or conclusions that are obviously inadmissible. The sole ground advanced is that the affidavit contains evidence which was not before the decision-maker. In my view, the affidavit is so substantial and considerable that it would be unfair to the applicant to let it proceed for judicial review without dealing with it. Consequently, it would assist the orderly progress of the judicial review if this matter was disposed of in advance of the hearing.
