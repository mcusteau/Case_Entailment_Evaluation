Notwithstanding that the plaintiff requested, in his pleadings, other damages in the nature of special damages, little argument was advanced and little was done to develop an evidentiary basis for this. The plaintiff, in his evidence, described the damage he suffered as a result of the termination of the contract as follows:
"... I guess we kind of figured our lives around that cheque. It wasn't much, but the way we live, we got a big garden and everything. Everything is our own. So it [the contract] was quite convenient. After those cheques stopped coming then we went on social assistance for about three months. We picked berries and sold them. I sharpened chain saws and anything I could get hold of."
Generally, aside from very exceptional cases which this is not, special damages are not awarded in a claim for breach of contract.
