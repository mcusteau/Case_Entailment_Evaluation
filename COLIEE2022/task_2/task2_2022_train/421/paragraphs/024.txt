Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the General Conditions DSS 9076 ought not to be construed as part of the contract in this case. Further, it was submitted that even if they were considered to be incorporated by refer ence, they should not be construed against the plaintiff. It is said these circumstances where the plaintiff has concluded a contract entirely drafted, or virtually so, by the defendant, (sometimes referred to as a

) the plaintiff ought to have the benefit of construction which is favourable to him, a principle or rule of construction referred to as the contra proferentem rule.
