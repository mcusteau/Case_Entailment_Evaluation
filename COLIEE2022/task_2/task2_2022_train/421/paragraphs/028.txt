Mrs. Abenstein, corroborating testimony of her husband, stated that they had never received a copy of DSS 9076 with the latest or any earlier contracts. Mr. Grouette, testifying for the defendant, did not know whether at any time a copy of the document had been sent to the Abensteins, and further that one was not forwarded with the latest contract, in keeping with the departmental practice to provide a copy only when expressly requested. No such request was apparently recorded from the Abensteins. When asked in cross-examination what her understanding was with respect to termination of a contract, Mrs. Abenstein responded by reference to one of the conditions preprinted on the back page of the contract form which provided in part that the terms and conditions of the contract "shall not be altered or added to by anything not set out therein, except by an amendment to this document agreed to by both parties", that termination required agreement of both parties aside from reasonable exceptions for just cause, including failure to perform. In her view failure to attend on time on one day did not constitute a refusal to perform the contract.
