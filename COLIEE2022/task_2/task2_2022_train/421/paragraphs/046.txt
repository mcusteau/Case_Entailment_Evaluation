The evidence as called by counsel for both parties described a set of circumstances and events which were clearly frustrating and unproductive for all parties concerned. In light of the facts and the law as set out above, however, I am of the opinion that the defendant's decision to terminate prematurely its contract with the plaintiff on November 5, 1985 was without legal justification. Where a party in default of a contract has committed a fundamental breach of the contract, a breach which goes "to the root of the contract", the "innocent" party to the contract may be discharged from further performance of his undertakings. In this case I conclude that none of the three particulars of breach by the plaintiff set out in the statement of defence constituted a fundamental breach of the contract by the plaintiff. Taken all together the three did not constitute such a breach. Nor did any of them, or all of them together, constitute default within clause 16(1) of DSS 9076 which would warrant termination by the defendant.
