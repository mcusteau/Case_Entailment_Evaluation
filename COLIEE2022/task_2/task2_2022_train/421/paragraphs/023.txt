These two clauses deal with different circumstances; the first authorizes termination by the Minister without cause, the second deals with circumstances where the party contracting with the Crown is deemed to have defaulted under the contract. In the second case, provision is made by clause 16(2) for a matter to be treated as termination by the Minister under s. 15, but only in circumstances where the contracting party is in default and the Minister determines that the default is not caused by the action of the contractor. There is no reference to such a determination by the Minister in this case, indeed the evidence of Mr. Grouette, responsible for contract administration for Supply and Services in Manitoba, was that he decided to give notice of termination on behalf of the Minister in reliance upon reports through his assistant from Lieutenant Gregory about the default in performance of the work by the plaintiff. The pleading, the evidence and argument on behalf of her Majesty all related to termination of the contract for cause, the default in performance by the plaintiff. Thus, only clause 16(1) of DSS 9076 is relevant here as the basis of the action to terminate the contract.
