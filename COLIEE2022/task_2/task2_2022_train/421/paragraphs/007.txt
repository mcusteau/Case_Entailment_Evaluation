On October 16, 1985, the plaintiff did not arrive at the station to pick up the garbage until approximately 7:00 p.m. After a brief discussion about the lateness of the hour with Corporal Denis Durand, then in charge at the gate house, the plaintiff was allowed entry to collect the garbage, which he did without incident. As he was leaving the station with the garbage, however, the plaintiff was stopped by Corporal Durand who informed the plaintiff that he was obliged to search his truck. The plaintiff stepped out of the truck after opening the doors and hood of the vehicle, and Corporal Durand commenced his search.
