[56]
The evidence adduced in relation to damages was scant. Counsel for the plaintiff suggested I consider a reference on the question of damages if the plaintiff were successful in his claim that the defendant was liable. In my view the amount of damages at stake is minimal; a reference on the issue would only result in further costs to the parties; and damages can be ascertained in reasonable measure by the Court. A reference in this case, in my view, is not warranted.
