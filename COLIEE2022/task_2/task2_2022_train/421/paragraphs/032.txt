In the case before me, the defendant may treat the contract at issue here as discharged only if it can be demonstrated that the plaintiff has committed a fundamental breach. What, then, constitutes a fundamental breach? Again having regard to Cheshire, Fifoot and Furmston's Law of Contract, at p. 526:
"There are two alternative tests that may provide the answer. The court may find the decisive element either in the importance that the parties would seem to have attached to the term which has been broken or to the seriousness of the consequences that have in fact resulted from the breach ..."
Both of these tests may come into play in an assessment of fundamental breach. The test has been described in other words by Diplock, L.J., in Hong Kong Fir Shipping Co. Ltd. v. Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., [1962] 2 Q.B. 26; [1962] 1 All E.R. 474 (C.A.):
"The test ... has been stated in a number of metaphors all of which I think amount to the same thing: does the occurrence of the event deprive the party who has further undertakings still to perform of substantially the whole benefit which it was the intention of the parties as expressed in the contract that he should obtain as the consideration for performing those undertakings?"
Stated more succinctly, "fundamental breach" may, according to Chitty on Contracts (26th Ed., London, 1989), be simply a restatement of the principle that:
"a particular breach or breaches may be such as to go to the root of the contract and entitle the other party to treat such breach or breaches as a repudication of the whole contract." (para. 1730)
