The contract in question, like its predecessors, was concluded by a series of steps. The Department of Supply and Services would send to Mr. Abenstein an Invitation and Tender form relating to the Garbage and Ash Removal Contract, which contained conditions for tendering, and for the contract, with specifications of the work to be performed. Mr. Abenstein would complete the form by providing pricing details for which he would perform the work, and by signing and dating the tender which was then returned to the department. If his tender were accepted, as it was in 1985 and on previous occasions, a printed form contract would be returned to him, advising his tender was accepted, setting out basic details of the contract from the tender form, including pricing details for the services, the terms of the contract and the estimated and limited expenditures under the contract, with the signature of a departmental officer on the document. While both the Invitation to Tender and the Contract forms include the provision that General Conditions DDS 9076 (Services) shall form part of the contract, testimony of the Supply and Services officer responsible for contracts in Manitoba established that it was the practice to provide copies of these conditions only upon request and they were not sent with every contract concluded by the department.
