During argument counsel for both parties agreed that, if he were entitled to damages the plaintiff should be entitled to prejudgment interest on this amount. I regret to say that I am unable to agree. Section 36 of the Federal Court Act sets out that:
"36. In adjudicating on any claim against the Crown, the Court shall not allow interest on any sum of money that the Court considers to be due to the claimant, in the absence of any contract stipulating for payment of that interest or of a statute providing in such a case for the payment of interest by the Crown."
The contract in this case made no provision for payment of interest on claims arising because of its alleged breach. I am unaware of any statutory authority which "provides ... for the payment of interest by the Crown" in a contract action such as this one. I am left no alternative but to refuse the plaintiff's claim for prejudgment interest. In accord with s. 41 of the Federal Court Act the plaintiff is entitled to interest from the date of judgment until it is paid.
