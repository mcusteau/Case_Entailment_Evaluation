The respondent's COMPUOFFICE trademark is also not inherently distinctive. It merely suggests a "computerized office" software program. As mentioned, thousands of trademarks and trade names exist which incorporate the prefix "COMPU". However, as with the applicant, the COMPUOFFICE trademark has acquired distinctiveness through continual use since 1990. The applicant has not demonstrated any third party use of the COMPUOFFICE trademark, and the respondent has sold the product under the COMPUOFFICE trademark to many customers.
