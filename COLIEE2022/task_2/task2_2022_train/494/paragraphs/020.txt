Distinctiveness concerns the originality of the trademark: the more original and distinctive the trademark, the stronger the protection. A strong, inherently distinctive trademark consists of a striking inventive name, and is entitled to a wide scope of protection; on the other hand, a trademark lacking such qualities is inherently less distinctive, and is a weaker mark. The ambit of protection afforded to a weak mark is much less than for a strong mark, and registration of other marks containing comparatively small differences may be permitted. (
