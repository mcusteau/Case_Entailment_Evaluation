When trademarks are similar, the degree of similarity between the wares or services which bear the marks is a large factor in determining whether confusion is likely to result. Although confusion may result whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class, yet where one product does not suggest the other, it is a strong indication that confusion is unlikely. In assessing the likelihood of confusion, the Court must examine how the trademarks are used in the course of business. (
