The applicant's trademark is not inherently distinctive per se. It merely suggests a "computerized life" insurance software program. Moreover, thousands of trademarks and trade names exist which incorporate the prefix "COMPU". Where a variety of trademarks exists with the same features, the trademark has less inherent distinctiveness. (

(1992), 50 Q.A.C. 101; 45 C.P.R.(3d) 96 at 107-114 (Que CA).). However, the COMPULIFE trademark has acquired distinctiveness through continual use in the insurance industry since 1982. The applicant has spent approximately $250,000 to promote its COMPULIFE software product. There are approximately 800 subscribers to its service, and it has generated over $6,000,000 in sales. Therefore, given its long-standing use in a specialized industry, the COMPULIFE trademark has acquired an inherent distinctiveness.
