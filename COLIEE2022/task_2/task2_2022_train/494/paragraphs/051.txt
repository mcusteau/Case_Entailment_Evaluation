This evidence falls well short of proving that the applicant used ACROSS THE BOARD as a trademark within the meaning of s. 4 of the
Act
. A passing reference in an undated advertisement is insufficient to prove that the option was ever finalized or incorporated into the COMPULIFE product. Nor did the applicant adduce any evidence to show that the ACROSS THE BOARD option was used continuously and without significant interruption. (
Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd. v. Living Realty Inc.
(1999), 179 F.T.R. 161; 4 C.P.R.(4th) 71 at 82 (T.D.)). The applicant's evidence does not persuade the Court that ACROSS THE BOARD was displayed qua trademark by the applicant or by anyone. Consequently, this ground of expungement fails.
