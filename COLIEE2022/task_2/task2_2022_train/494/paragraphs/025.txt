The COMPULIFE trademark has been used continuously since November, 1982. The COMPUOFFICE trademark, although registered on May 3, 1996, has been in continuous use since March, 1990. Therefore, both trademarks were used concurrently for eight years without confusion before the COMPUOFFICE trademark was registered. Therefore, there is little likelihood that the consumers of the products will be confused about their respective sources.
