The applicant submits the following three grounds to expunge the respondent's COMPUOFFICE trademark from the register of trademarks:
a. Under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the
Act
, the COMPUOFFICE trademark was not registrable because it was confusing with the applicant's COMPULIFE registered trademark;
b. Under subsection 18(1) of the
Act
, the COMPUOFFICE trademark was invalid because the respondent was not entitled to secure the registration because it was confusing with the COMPULIFE trademark and trade-name previously used in Canada; and
c. Under paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Act
, the COMPUOFFICE trademark is invalid because it was not distinctive at the time these proceedings were commenced.
