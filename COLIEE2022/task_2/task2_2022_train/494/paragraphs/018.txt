[18]
By statutory definition in s. 6(2), a trademark is confusing with another trademark if its use on wares or services is likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services are sold or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class. Therefore, the question to answer is whether the use of both trademarks will likely lead to the inference that the wares and services are provided by the same person. (

(1998), 141 F.T.R. 72; 78 C.P.R.(3d) 435 at 439). The likelihood of confusion must be considered as a matter of first impression from the perspective of an average consumer having a vague or imperfect recollection of the first trademark. (

(1999), 176 F.T.R. 80; 3 C.P.R.(4th) 224 at 236 (F.C.T.D.)). The issue is to be determined by reference to persons who are likely to purchase the wares in question. (
