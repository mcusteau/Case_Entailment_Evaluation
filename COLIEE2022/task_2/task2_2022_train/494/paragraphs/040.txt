A trademark's registration may be invalidated because the trademark is no longer distinctive at the time the invalidation proceedings are commenced. Here, the key date is June 25, 1997, upon which these proceedings were commenced. While distinctiveness is often determined as part of an evaluation of whether a proposed mark is confusing with another mark, it is an independent ground for refusing registration because the trademark may suffer widespread use by third parties.
