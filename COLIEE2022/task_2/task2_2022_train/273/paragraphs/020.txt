Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Chen (R.W.)
, [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 726; [1999] F.C.J. No. 1815 (T.D.), Nadon, J., held that the decision as to whether the individual is likely to appear for removal is to be made before any consideration is to be given to the question of the security deposit or the surety.
"As I read s.s 103(3)(b) and 103(7), an adjudicator must order the release of a person from detention 'subject to such terms and conditions as the adjudicator deems appropriate in the circumstances, including the payment of a security deposit or the posting of a performance bond' once he is satisfied that the person in detention is likely to appear for removal. In other words, if the adjudicator is satisfied, on the evidence before him, that the person in detention will not abscond, he must then order the release of that person subject to terms and conditions which may include the payment of a security deposit. The posting of a bond and the amount thereof are not part of the evidence relevant to the determination which the adjudicator must make as to the likelihood of the person appearing for removal. Thus, on my understanding of the subsections, the adjudicator must make up his mind with regard to the likelihood of the person absconding or appearing for removal on the basis of the evidence without regard to the bond which he might impose if satisfied that the person in detention will likely appear for removal."
