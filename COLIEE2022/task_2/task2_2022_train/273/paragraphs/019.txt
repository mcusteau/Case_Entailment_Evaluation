It appears that the theory behind the requirement for a security deposit or a performance bond is that the person posting the bond or deposit will be sufficiently at risk to take an interest in seeing that the releasee complies with the conditions of release including appearing for removal. From the point of view of the person who is to be released, the element of personal obligation to the surety is thought to act as an incentive to compliance. While this may be true generally, it may not be true in the case of an organized smuggling operation where significant sums of money are involved. One can infer from the fact that persons pay large sums of money to be smuggled into North America that the earnings prospects are better here than in the place from which they came. The smugglers do not get paid until their customers access this greater earning power. So they have an interest in seeing that their client remains in North America. In those circumstances, it makes sense for a smuggler to put up the money for the security deposit with a view to either helping or coercing the client to go underground and begin repayment of the debt. The risk of financial loss, in such a case, is not in forfeiture of the security deposit but in the possibility of the smuggler's client being returned to his home. The client's sense of obligation to the smuggler does not act as an inducement to compliance with the conditions of release. In fact the opposite is true.
