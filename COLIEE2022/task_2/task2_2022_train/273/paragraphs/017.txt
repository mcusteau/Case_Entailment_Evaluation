In my view the adjudicator was correct in rejecting a request for cross-examination made after his decision as to release was announced. If the Minister's representative were given leave to cross-examine at that point, there is the possibility of the decision being reversed if the cross-examination proved unfavourable. But the adjudicator cannot reverse his own decision. Any review of a surety must take place within the evidentiary portion of a detention review, not after a release decision has been made.
