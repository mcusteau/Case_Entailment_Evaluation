In my view, the ground on which the Minister succeeds is the issue of the security deposit. There are two related issues here, one of which was pleaded by the Minister and one which emerged in argument. The one pleaded by the Minister is that it was a denial of natural justice to fail to allow the Minister's representative to cross-examine the sureties when he requested leave to do so. As the argument developed, the fact of allowing anyone to post the security deposit became an issue. Counsel for the Minister took the position that the adjudicator had an obligation to consider the suitability of the surety if a security deposit were to be required.
