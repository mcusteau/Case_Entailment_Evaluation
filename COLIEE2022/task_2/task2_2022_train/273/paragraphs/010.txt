The conclusions which the Adjudicator reached and which are material to these proceedings are the following:
- He concluded that both Ai Ming Zhang and Zu Fa Zhang were likely to report (for removal) and he would therefore be ordering release on that basis.
- The test is the balance of probabilities.
- He assessed the credibility of the two individuals and found that there was no evidence that they were untruthful or misleading.
- He rejected evidence tendered by the Minister tending to show that persons from a particular region of China are a greater risk of not appearing than perhaps other refugee claimants from around the world. He rejected evidence that in the five incidents involving groups of immigrants arriving in Canada by sea since 1999, 167 of 267 persons released have disappeared on the ground that the meaning of "disappeared" was unclear and that the evidence consisted of a simple tabulation rather than statistics.
- He questioned the notion that everyone who belongs to a particular group will approach things in a certain way.
- He concluded that the travellers overall goal was to escape China not to reach the U.S.A. If they landed in Canada, so be it. If they landed in the U.S.A., so be it.
- The fact that the individuals have a concern about returning to China simply confirms that they are refugees and does not mean they will not report for removal.
- He found that Zu Fa Zhang has a good impression of Canada and believed him when he said he did not have a job waiting for him in the United States.
- He found that Zu Fa Zhang had several friends in Toronto to stay with and a cousin of his mother in Toronto to provide him with support.
- He found that Ai Ming Zhang was a trustworthy individual because he had voluntarily departed Japan, to which he had travelled, when his refugee claim was refused.
- He found that it was contrary to the respondent's interests to go underground to be indentured to the snake heads because that would mean that they would make little money, (which is the connotation of being indentured), whereas if they had work permits in Canada they could work legally and make more money so as to pay down their debt faster. In addition they would qualify for social benefits.
