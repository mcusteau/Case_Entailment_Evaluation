In a decision dated August 13, 1997 an entitlement appeal panel of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board dismissed an appeal from the Board's review panel. The applicant requested a rehearing by the Board in light of the subsequent decision of this court in
Ewing v. Veterans Review and Appeal Board (Can.) et al.
(1997), 137 F.T.R. 298 (T.D.). In that case it was held that the Board had misinterpreted s. 21(2)(a) of the
Pension Act
by denying a pension on the ground that the claimant was not "on duty" when the injury occurred. Gibson, J., stated that an injury could "arise from" or be "directly connected with" military service within the meaning of s. 21(2)(a), even if the claimant was not at that time "on duty" for other military purposes.
