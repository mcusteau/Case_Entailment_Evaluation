[67]
It is true that these words are not in the legislation; however, the phrase "
directly
connected" in my opinion required the Board to consider the strength of the causal connection between the injury and the applicant's military service. In contrasting "contributing cause" with "setting", the Board was distinguishing stronger from weaker causal connections between the injury and the performance of military service. Given that it is not sufficient that, when injured, the applicant was serving in the military, I find that the Board committed no error of law here in its understanding of the statutory test.
