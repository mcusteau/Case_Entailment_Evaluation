M.W.O. McTague has made an applicaÂ­tion for judicial review of the decision by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board confirming its earlier determination that he was not eligible for a disability pension. His counsel submitted that the Board erred in law when it found that, on these facts, the applicant's injury did not "arise out of" or was not "directly connected with" military service, and accordingly should be set aside.
