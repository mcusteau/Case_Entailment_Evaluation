The precise extent to which a finality clause precludes or limits judicial review must be determined within the context of the particular statutory scheme in which it appears (
Dayco (Canada) Ltd. v. National Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers Union of Canada (CAW-Canada)
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 230; 152 N.R. 1; 63 O.A.C. 1). In my opinion, the provisions considered above strongly indicate that Parliament intended the court to afford considerable deference to the Board's decisions when challenged in an application for judicial review.
