 [7] 
  I agree that officers have a duty to give notice of an interview. But I do not agree with Mr. Ilahi that the respondent must prove that he received his notice. However, the respondent does have to prove that the officer sent an interview notice to the applicant: Canada (Attorney General) v. Herrera, [2001] F.C.J. No. 120 (C.A.) (QL). Implicit in this obligation is a duty to send the notice to the correct address. It falls to an applicant to ensure that the visa office is kept informed of his or her current address. Mr. Ilahi clearly did so here.
