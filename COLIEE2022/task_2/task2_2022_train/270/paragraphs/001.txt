Barnes, J.
: This application for judicial review concerns an Adjudicator's decision made under s. 92 of the
Public Service Staff Relations
Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35 (
Act
) [see footnote 1]. The only issue before the Court involves the Adjudicator's assumption of jurisdiction over the Respondent's grievance against his employer, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). The Adjudicator found that the CFIA's treatment of the Respondent was disciplinary resulting in a suspension and, therefore, he assumed jurisdiction over the grievance. He then found that the discipline imposed by the CFIA was unwarranted and he upheld the Respondent's grievance. The Applicant contends that the Adjudicator erred by accepting jurisdiction over the grievance in circumstances that were outside of the arbitral authority conferred by the
Act
and he seeks to have the decision quashed.
