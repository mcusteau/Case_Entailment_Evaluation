I cannot accede to this argument. I note that in the action of MacMillan against Axia:
a) MacMillan only claimed ownership to the U.S. patents; the Canadian patents are not mentioned in his Statement of Claim, or in the reasons for judgment or the Order.
b) the Order merely states that Northstar's action was dismissed; there is no declaration that Axia is the owner of the patents.
