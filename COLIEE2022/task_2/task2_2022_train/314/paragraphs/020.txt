Third, there is an outstanding lawsuit between Axia and MacMillan in British Columbia to determine the ownership of the Adjustable Handle Canadian patent. It was filed by Axia on June 3, 2004 (B.C. Court No. S033105) (the "Axia Action"). It refers to both the Canadian patents for the Adjustable Handle and the Flat Box. The prayer for relief in the Statement of Claim specifically asks for:
"(d) an order for specific performance compelling the Defendant, MacMillan, to perform his obligations contained in Articles 8 and 12 of the 1995 Employment Agreement;"
And with respect to the Adjustable Handle (but not the Flat Box) demands:
"(g) further or in the alternative, a declaration that the patent issued to Northstar for the Adjustable Handle is invalid pursuant to s. 53(1) of the
Patent Act
