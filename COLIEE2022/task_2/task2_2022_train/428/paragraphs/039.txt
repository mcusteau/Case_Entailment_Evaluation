He wrote at paragraph 39 of his reasons:
"Â¶ 39 Indeed, this Court has long approved of a broad approach to s. 70(1)(b) (or its predecessor legislation). Martland, J., stated in
Grillas v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration
, [1972] S.C.R. 577, at p. 590 (dissenting, but not on this point) that, '[t]he intention of the
Act
was to enable the Board, in certain circumstances, to ameliorate the lot of an appellant against whom a deportation order had lawfully been made.' In the same case, Abbott, J., stated, for the majority, at p. 581:
'This somewhat unusual section [s. 15, the provisions of which are now contained in ss. 70(1)(b) and 70(3)(b)] gives the Board broad discretionary powers to allow a person to remain in Canada who is inadmissible under the
Immigration Act
. Before the section was enacted, such power was vested solely in the executive branch of Government.
'Whether the discretion to be exercised by the Board under s. 15 be described as equitable, administrative or political, it is not in the strict sense a judicial discretion, but it would appear it should be exercised essentially upon humanitarian grounds.'
"This view was confirmed by Sopinka, J., for the Court, in
Chiarelli
, supra, at p. 737, where he stated that s. 70(1)(b) 'allows for clemency from deportation on compassionate grounds'. In the I.R.B. publication,
Removal Order Appeals
(1999), at p. 9-2, it is stated that s. 70(1)(b) 'contemplates the realization of a valid social objective, namely, relief from the hardship that may be caused by the [page108] pure operation of the law relating to removal'. I agree."
