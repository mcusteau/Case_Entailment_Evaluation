I also cite what the Supreme Court of Canada held in
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; 281 N.R. 1, at 23 when dealing with the standard which should be adopted in respect of a Minister's decision that a refugee constitutes a danger to the security of Canada. The Supreme Court held such a discretionary decision should not be set aside unless patently unreasonable "
in the sense that it was made arbitrarily or in bad faith, it cannot be supported on the evidence, or the Minister failed to consider the appropriate factors
". (Emphasis mine)
