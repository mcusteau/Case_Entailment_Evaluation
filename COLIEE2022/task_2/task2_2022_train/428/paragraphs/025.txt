The tribunal next analysed his marriage to Khalida Aryan who is a Tajic and Shia Muslim. Her uncle, grandfather and aunt have lived in Canada for about ten years; the families knew each another in Kabul; her father is the applicant's father's cousin. The tribunal recited Mr. Aryan's testimony about the living conditions in her refugee camp in Peshawar. It made this finding:
"I find that the separation of the appellant and his wife is emotionally and physically stressful to both of them. I am persuaded that the applicant and her family would not choose to remain in Peshawar, Pakistan, if they felt it was safe for them to return to Kabul, Afghanistan at this time. I also find, based on the evidence presented, which was not challenged by Minister's counsel, that conditions in Peshawar, Pakistan for Afghani refugees are poor. It is difficult and expensive for the appellant to travel to Peshawar, Pakistan and, due to his employment, he could at best make one trip per year during his vacation period. I find that both the appellant and the applicant are experiencing some hardship as a result of their separation.
There are positive compassionate and humanitarian factors that exist in this case.
