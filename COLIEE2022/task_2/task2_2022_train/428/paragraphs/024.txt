The tribunal quoted some cross-examination by the Minister's counsel contrasting his success in obtaining a $30,000 loan for the van while he was a student on an income substantially less than his current income. It quoted the Minister's submission that the appellant had not established that he had made serious efforts to obtain financing to repay the $60,000 owed. The tribunal concluded:
"
