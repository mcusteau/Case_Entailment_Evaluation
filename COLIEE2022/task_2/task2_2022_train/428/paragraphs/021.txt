[21]
In order to provide an appropriate understanding to the tribunal's key findings, I outline some additional material facts which are not controverted, noting the tribunal made no adverse credibility findings against the applicant who testified before it:
1. After landing in Canada in 1989, Mr. Aryan, who had received medical training in Russia before fleeing Afghanistan in 1986, found full time work in Canada from 1989 to mid 1991 as an assistant manager at a Mac's Milk store in Toronto earning $20,000 per annum but he was laid off in 1991 when the store closed;
2. While on unemployment insurance, and on the advice of the UI officer, he took a six-month course at Centennial College training as a health care aide and then found work later that year (1991) as a health care worker;
3. In September of 1992 he enrolled as a special student at the University of Toronto (U of T) aiming to earn a bachelor of science which he did in 1996 after receiving certain credits for his studies in Russia where he had to travel to in 1995 in order to obtain his course transcripts. During his studies, he continued to work as a health care worker;
4. His parents were landed in Canada in April of 1993 but shortly thereafter they unexpectedly became ill (his father suffered from high blood pressure; his mother is arthritic; both later suffered strokes). With the applicant's assistance they made application under the Ontario Disability Support Plan and received $1,000 to $1,200 per month from August 1, 1993. It was agreed by Ontario Social Services with Mr. Aryan he would support his parents providing them $200 per month based on his income of $12,000 per year, (he was working part time during his attendance at U of T) an amount which was deducted from his parents' social assistance benefits.
5. His undertaking to the Minister ended in 1998. The applicant continues to support his parents increasing funding to $1,000 per month; his parents are still the disability support plan.
6. The record indicates his parents needed a van to get around and this was purchased in 1994 by the applicant paying $2,000 down and the rest ($28,000) on installments which he has paid off. For his own needs, he purchased in 1995 a used 1991 Pontiac paying $700.
7. His parents, since landing, have resided with their daughter in a rented bungalow, splitting the rent. She drives the van to get her parents about.
8. In 1996 after obtaining a post-graduate scholarship Mr. Aryan enrolled in a Masters degree program in Education and earned a degree in 1998. He continued to work throughout his studies.
9. He currently works at two jobs, one as a staff instructor at a long term care centre and the other, during the evenings, as an instructor in a health care support college. His current annual income is in the neighbourhood of $75,000.
10. The applicant does not own any real estate, lives in a one-bedroom rented apartment. He is paying $300 to $400 per month to his wife in Pakistan and is paying off accumulated student loans, now totalling $40,000, at the rate of $516 per month. He has total assets of $62,000 (car, RRSP, furniture, equipment and bank account).
