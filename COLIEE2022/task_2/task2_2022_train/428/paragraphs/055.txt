As noted, the tribunal has a broad discretion under paragraph 77(3)(b) cases. In this case, I have concluded there was no basis in the evidence for the tribunal's finding that allowing the sponsorship appeal to proceed without payment of the amount of the default would likely result in the non-payment of any of the $60,000 owing under the prior undertaking.
