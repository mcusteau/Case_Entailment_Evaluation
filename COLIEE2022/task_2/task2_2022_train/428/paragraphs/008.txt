The test adopted by the tribunal for the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction under paragraph 77(3)(b) of the former
Act
is based on the case of
Chirwa v. Canada (Minister of Manpower and Immigration)
(1970), 4 I.A.C. 33 (I.A.D.), a previous decision of the Appeal Division. That test is:
"[T]hose facts, established by the evidence, which would excite in a reasonable man in a civilized community a desire to relieve the misfortunes of another - so long as these misfortunes 'warrant the granting of special relief' under the provisions of the
Immigration Act
."
