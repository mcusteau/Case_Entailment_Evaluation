The Board also found a contradiction between the applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF) and her testimony. The applicant's PIF says that, on March 9, 2001, she went to inform her husband that the visitors were his colleagues from work. In her testimony, the applicant said she did not know who her husband's work colleagues were, as she kept away from his work business. The Board found that she contradicted herself again when she said she recognized the military uniform. The Board concludes that this casts doubt on the fact that her husband was in the military.
