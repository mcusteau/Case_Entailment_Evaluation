In arriving at its conclusions, the Board should of course be careful not to base its finding on microscopic examination of issues that are irrelevant or peripheral to the applicant's claim (Attakora v. Canada (M.C.I.), (1989), 99 N.R. 168, at par. 9 (F.C.A.); Owusu-Ansah v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1989] F.C.J. No 442 (C.A.)). The Board should also resist the temptation to apply the North American logic and standards to the claimant's behaviour (Rahnema v. Canada (Solicitor General), [1993] F.C.J. No. 1431 at par. 20 (F.C.); El-Naem v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1997] F.C.J. No. 185 (F.C.)).
