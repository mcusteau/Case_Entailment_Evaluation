With respect to the claim that the Board erred by basing its adverse credibility conclusion in part on the fact that the Applicant did not submit any documents to prove that she was married to a soldier in the Cameroon army, it is true that the letter sent by the Board and requesting the Applicant to send copies of any documents that relate to the issues to be discussed at the hearing (one of which was identified as being "credibility"), did not provide much particulars as to the type of documents that should be produced. Having said this, I do not think that denying the Applicant the possibility to seek documents establishing the existence of her husband and confirming that he was in the Cameroon armed forces amount to a denial of natural justice.
