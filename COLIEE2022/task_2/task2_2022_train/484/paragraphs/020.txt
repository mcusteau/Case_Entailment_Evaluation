Indeed, it was reasonable to assume that the Applicant would bring documents to establish her credibility. Since the membership of her husband in the army was a key element of her story, upon which her refugee claim hinges, one could reasonably expect that supporting documents would be filed to provide evidence of that membership and of her husband's assignment at the military camp where the fire broke out. As stated by my colleague Pinard, J. in Nechifor v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1278:
"The applicant further submits that the IRB made unreasonable inferences regarding his failure to produce medical certificates or a copy of the complaint he had filed with the police. It is settled law that a panel cannot make negative inferences from the fact that a party failed to produce any extrinsic document corroborating its allegations (Ahortor v. Canada (M.E.I.), (1993), 65 F.T.R. 137 and Miral v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (February 12, 1999), IMM-3392-97). However, when an applicant's credibility is at issue, a lack of evidence corroborating his allegations is a relevant consideration (see Syed v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, (March 13, 1998), IMM-1613-97 and Herrera v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (September 28, 1998), IMM-2737-97."
