  The applicant's first hurdle, whether the request be for an interlocutory injunction or an interlocutory mandatory injunction, is to transcend s. 22 of the  
 Crown Liability and Proceedings Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50, which provides: 
 
 
 
 "22(1) Where in proceedings against the Crown any relief is sought that might, in proceedings between persons, be granted by way of injunction or specific performance, a court shall not, as against the Crown, grant an injunction or make an order for specific performance, but in lieu thereof may make an order declaratory of the rights of the parties. 
 
 
 
 "2) A court shall not in any proceedings grant relief or make an order against a servant of the Crown that it is not competent to grant or make against the Crown."
