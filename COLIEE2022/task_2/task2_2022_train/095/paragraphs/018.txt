  There are two exceptions to the low threshold required to meet the serious issue element, both of which are articulated in  
 RJR-MacDonald 
 . The first exception arises when the result of the interlocutory motion will, in effect, amount to a final determination of the application. The second exception deals with questions of constitutionality and does not apply to this matter. If the relief amounts to a final determination of the main proceeding, a higher standard applies and an applicant must make out a prima facie case.
