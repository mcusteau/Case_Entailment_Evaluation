  NOSFA submits that the final element of the test, the balance of convenience, lies with the applicant. This is so because if the injunction is not granted, success on the judicial review will be hollow if the offshore fleet has already fished its quota. This maypush stocks beyond the point where recovery is not likely and the short-term interests of the offshore fleet will have been realized at the long-term expense of the ecosystem, the fish stocks and other sectors of the fishing industry. If, on the other hand, the injunction is granted and the 2003 stock status reports prove NOSFA wrong, the offshore fleet will merely be delayed in catching its quota.
