  In response to the concerns of the FRCC, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), in conjunction with the offshore fishing sector, conducted an acoustic survey/study in 2000 to examine the movement and mixing of the resident 4Vn cod. The results of this undertaking, which were available early in 2002, concluded that controlled fishing during the winter period would have a minimal impact on the resident stock. Consultations on the study were held with local fishers, including the applicant, during 2002. During and subsequent to those consultations, NOSFA expressed its concerns and uncertainties regarding the integrity of the acoustic survey and recommended to the Minister that the winter fishery in 4Vn remain closed.
