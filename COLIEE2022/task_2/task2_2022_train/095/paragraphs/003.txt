  The facts may be summarily stated. The southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence area is defined as Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) division 4T. The area east of Cape Breton is known as NAFO division 4Vn (Sydney Bight area). There are two distinct cod stocks involved in the 4Vn area. There is a resident cod stock that resides there all year. This stock mixes with the migratory 4T Gulf stock during the period from November to April. The cod stock defined as 4TVn refers to the southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence cod stock. The fishery on the 4TVn stock was closed during the moratorium between 1993 and 1999.
