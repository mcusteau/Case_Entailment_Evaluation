  The parties agree that the appropriate test for the granting of an interlocutory injunction is derived from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Metropolitan Stores (MTS) Ltd. v. Manitoba Food and Commercial Workers, Local 832 and Labour Board (Man.) 
 , [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110; 73 N.R. 341; 46 Man.R.(2d) 241 ( 
 Metropolitan 
 ), and  
 RJR-MacDonald Inc. et Imperial Tobacco Ltd. v. Canada (Procureur général) 
 , [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311; 164 N.R. 1; 60 Q.A.C. 241; 111 D.L.R.(4th) 385 ( 
 RJR-MacDonald 
 ). The elements are: 
 
 
 
 (a) there exists a serious issue to be tried; 
 
 
 
 (b) irreparable harm will result if the relief is not granted, and 
 
 
 
 (c) the balance of convenience favours the granting of the relief.
