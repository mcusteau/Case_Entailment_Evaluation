  At this stage, there exists a difference of opinion regarding the propriety of the decision to allow winter fishing in the 4Vn area. The evidence proffered by the applicant raises issues with respect to the results of the acoustic survey that suggest, "[O]ne could  
 argue 
  that this assumption  
 may 
  not be correct" (emphasis mine) and "[A]ny directed fishery in 4TVn  
 may 
  target far more than 3%-5% of 4Vn resident stock especially  
 if 
  the current assessment of 1659t is inaccurate" (emphasis mine). The expert opinion evidence states that the DFO has, "failed to adequately examine the potential adverse effects of this opening on commercial groundfish and invertebrates". A difference of opinion, without more, does not constitute a legal issue. The quality of the Minister's decision (in the absence of some indication that he lacked jurisdiction to make such a decision or was motivated by irrelevant considerations or acted arbitrarily or in bad faith) does not constitute a serious issue whether the threshold with respect to a "serious issue" is low or that of a prima facie case. Even on a preliminary assessment of the merits, on the basis of the record as it presently exists, I am unable to conclude that there is a serious issue.
