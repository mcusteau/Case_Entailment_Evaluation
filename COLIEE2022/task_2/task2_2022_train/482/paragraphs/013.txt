The Citizenship Judge did not address his mind to the nature and quality of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada, focusing solely on the family relationship in respect of which there is, at a minimum, some ambiguity. The evidence in support of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada appears to consist entirely of relatively passive elements. She has maintained an apartment since May 1, 1996. Her previous residence, which she describes as having rented, was at 5 Fisherville #1004, Toronto, Ontario. On her Record of Landing, Mrs. Mindich gave the name of her son as the person willing to assist her in Canada. The son's address is 5 Fisherville Street #1004, Willowdale, Ontario. This may indicate that she has only had her own address in Canada for slightly more than a year in the four years preceding her application.
