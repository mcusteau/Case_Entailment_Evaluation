Taken together, this evidence falls short of establishing the kind of connection with Canada contemplated by Thurlow, A.C.J. (as he then was) in
Re Papadogiorgakis
. It is more consistent with Mrs. Mindich acquiring a "pied-Ã -terre" in Canada to facilitate visiting her son while maintaining her former life in Israel. I find in the record little evidence capable of supporting a conclusion that Mrs. Mindich has centralized her mode of life in Canada for three years preceding her application for citizenship. While the Citizenship Judge is entitled to some deference in his assessment of the quality of Mrs. Mindich's attachment to Canada, I must, with respect, disagree with his conclusion. I therefore allow the Minister's appeal.
