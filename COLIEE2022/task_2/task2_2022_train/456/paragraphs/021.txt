Mr Li also suggests that, in 2004, the officers must have turned their minds to the question of whether he had forfeited his refugee status and, by implication, determined that he had not. It makes no sense, he says, that a decision could be made supporting his permanent resident status when, before the deciding officer, there was evidence purportedly indicating that he had relinquished his refugee status. Further, since immigration officers in foreign posts must apply the definition of a refugee, they must also understand and apply the concept of cessation. This assertion has some logical force. However, I can see no basis for it either in the evidence, or by necessary implication. As I see it, in 2004, the officer did not address the issue of cessation, either explicitly or implicitly. The officer found that Mr Li had not lost his permanent resident status for want of physical presence in Canada and simply did not address the issue of cessation of refugee status.
