[55]
My responses to Mr Li's proposed questions are as follows:
1. Cessation is an issue entirely separate from permanent residence and was not addressed by the officials who considered Mr Li's permanent resident status. In theory, the officials could have considered cessation, but this possibility is not sufficient to render their decisions
res judicata
under these circumstances. That proposition would only apply where the cause of action is the same; that is not the case here. Therefore, the doctrine of
res judicata
does not apply here;
2. This question is speculative, as there was no waiver;
3. Mr Li has cited no authority for the proposition that a new policy cannot be applied to past circumstances. Therefore, this does not raise a serious question of general importance;
4. Nothing turns on this question;
5. And 6. No factual basis for the claim of unfairness has been made out. Therefore, no serious question of general importance arises.
