Mr Li argues that the Minister's application for cessation was improper because, in effect, the same issues were already decided when the immigration officer facilitated his return to Canada in 2004. Further, he submits that the Minister's application amounts to an abuse of process given the delay in bringing it, the nature of the government policy that applies to it, and the oblique motive that lay behind it - namely, to remove him from Canada due to his criminal record. Mr Li also maintains that the Board erred by applying the wrong burden of proof, and by relying on a number of extraneous grounds, such as his failure to apply for Canadian citizenship, his criminal record, and his travel history. He asks me to quash the Board's decision and order another panel to reconsider the Minister's application.
