Mr Li argues that the Board failed to take account of the fact that a few of his trips were to Hong Kong, an area administered separately from mainland China. His trips there, he says, cannot be used to show his re-availment of Chinese protection. However, the evidence showed that Mr Li made only four trips to Hong Kong, while he travelled to mainland China at least 13 times. On this evidence, even if the trips to Hong Kong were removed from consideration for the reason Mr Li advances, the Board's conclusion on re-availment would still be reasonable.
