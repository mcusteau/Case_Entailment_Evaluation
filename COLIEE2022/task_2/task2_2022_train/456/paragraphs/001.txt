O'Reilly, J.
: Mr Peter Sum Li, a citizen of the People's Republic of China, achieved refugee status in Canada in 1990. Two years later, he became a permanent resident. In 2013, the Minister of Public Safety applied to the Immigration and Refugee Board to cease the refugee protection provided to Mr Li. The Board granted the Minister's application and nullified Mr Li's refugee status.
