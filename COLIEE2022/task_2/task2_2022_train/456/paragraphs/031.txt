In my view, this change in the consequences of a cessation finding and the corresponding shift in priority does not amount to a retroactive application of the law. Nor was there an impermissible application of a new policy. There was no change to the substantive grounds on which cessation applications could be brought. Canadian law continues to reflect the cessation provisions of the Refugee Convention (
IRPA
, s 108). The cessation proceedings relating to Mr Li were initiated after the change in the law and, therefore, the current statutory consequences of granting the Minister's application properly apply to Mr Li - they are not being applied retroactively. The fact that proceedings were not initiated earlier is likely a product of Mr Li's lengthy incarceration. In the circumstances, I cannot conclude that the fact that the result of a cessation finding changed while he was in prison imposed an abusive, arbitrary or unfair consequence on him.
