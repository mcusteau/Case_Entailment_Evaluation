[54]
Mr Li proposed the following questions for certification:
1. Is cessation an issue that could have been raised and therefore
res judicata
when a visa office grants a permanent resident travel document or the respondent grants a permanent resident card?
2. Can the doctrine of waiver apply where the decision is not one to which the doctrine of
res judicata
applies?
3. Does the principle that "the power to make retroactive policies will not be inferred unless the statute requires it" apply to the policy to give increased priority to cessation applications consequent on the changes to the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
which came into force on December 15, 2012?
4. Is the presumption of re-availment on obtaining a passport an evidentiary or legal presumption?
5. Is the duty of fairness in cessation proceedings breached where the Minister of Public Safety has sought a removal order and the Canada Border Services Agency hearings officer who is acting for the Minister in admissibility proceedings both applies to the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board for cessation and represents the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration at cessation proceedings?
6. Is the duty of fairness in cessation proceedings breached where the Canada Border Services Agency hearings officer who exercises the delegated jurisdiction to seek cessation is the same as the officer who represents the Minister at cessation proceedings?
