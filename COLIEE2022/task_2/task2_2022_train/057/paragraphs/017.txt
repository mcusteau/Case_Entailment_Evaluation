  In this case, the Board erred in failing to address the evidence which undermined the IFA finding. It would appear that the Board, having found the Applicants not credible, did not go on to conduct a proper s. 97 analysis. That would be an error of law. To the extent that the IFA finding is considered as addressing s. 97 issues, it was patently unreasonable and an error in law because it did not consider the evidence of risk in Colombo.
