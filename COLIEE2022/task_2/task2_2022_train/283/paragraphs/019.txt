The applicant has failed to establish any reviewable error in the decision of the Refugee Protection Division within the meaning of paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended. In very brief submissions, both parties suggested the appropriate standard of review was patently unreasonable. For the reasons I have stated, the decision was neither clearly wrong nor patently unreasonable. Accordingly, the application for judicial review will be dismissed.
