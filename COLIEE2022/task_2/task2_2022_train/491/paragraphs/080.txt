Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. v. Wednesbury Corp.

Hall & Co. v. Shoreham-by-Sea Urban District Council
, [1964] 1 W.L.R. 240 (C.A.)). As Coffin, J., writes in
Nova Scotia Industries v. Nova Scotia Pulpwood Marketing Board
(1975), 12 N.S.R.(2d) 91; at p. 115 (C.A.):
"Examples of unreasonableness include the failure of one exercising discretion to 'direct himself properly in law', to 'call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider'."
