Complaint H30995 was filed pursuant to s. 7 of the
Act
and s. 13.1 of S.C. 1976-77 c. 33, as amended. In that complaint, the applicant alleged that discrimination due to age and sex occurred when her position was disestablished and she was forced to sign an education agreement in order to upgrade her skills. According to the applicant, this agreement required her to work harder than her male peers, removed from her the opportunity to keep current her knowledge of cryptanalysis and Signal Intelligence and adversely affected her pension and right to early retirement. In addition, she argued that the CSE did not respect the terms of the agreement and harassed her with respect to the agreement.
