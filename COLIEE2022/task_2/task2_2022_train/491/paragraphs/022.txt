After the applicant was notified of the termination of the agreement and was ordered to return to work, she submitted a written complaint to the Deputy Minister of Defence. When the Deputy Minister decided to close his file on the matter, the Deputy Chief of the CSE sent two letters instructing the applicant to report to work on April 25, 1988 and May 2, 1988 respectively. On May 4, 1988, after the applicant did not show up at the CSE, the Deputy Chief sent her a letter, declaring her to have abandoned her position. Due to the nature of the termination of employment, the applicant was not entitled to severance pay and was only entitled to the return of her Public Service Superannuation fees.
