On May 2, 1988, the CHRC appointed a Human Rights Officer to investigate the merits of the first complaint. This officer was replaced by Lisa Quiring on September 28, 1990, who investigated both complaints. Most investigatory activity appears to have been conducted within a period of three days (October 30th to November 1st), and the applicant complained that a number of people on the list that she submitted to the investigator as witness on her behalf were not interviewed or were only partially interviewed. In her report, dated December 13, 1991, Ms. Quiring recommended that each of the complaints be dismissed, as the allegations of discrimination could not be founded on the evidence.
