Now that ss. 18 and 28 of the
Federal Court Act
have been amended, characterization of decision-making processes as "administrative" versus "judicial" is no longer necessary in Federal Court actions as well. (See inter alia,
Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177; 58 N.R. 1; 17 D.L.R.(4th) 422; 14 C.R.R. 13; 12 Admin. L.R. 137, where, prior to the amendment of the
Federal Court Act
, Wilson, J., Dickson, C.J., and Lamer, J., applied this distinction in holding that the Minister's determination under s. 45 of the
Immigration Act
was not reviewable under s. 28)
