I cannot agree that s. 44(3) of the
Act
allows the CHRC to completely divorce such decisions from the merits of the complaint. If purely administrative considerations (i.e., cost, time) were allowed to prevail it is conceivable that a person's entitlement to relief under human rights legislation would be dependent on the ease of proving human rights violations. Such an approach is clearly inconsistent with the justice-based purpose of the
Act
, stated in s. 2, to give effect to the principle of equal opportunity. There exists ample authority in Canadian law that administrative agencies must, in exercising discretionary power, pursue purposes that in no way offends the spirit of the enabling statute (See

(1976), 73 D.L.R.(3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.);
