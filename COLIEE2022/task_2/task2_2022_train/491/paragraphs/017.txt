The evidence indicates that on at least five separate occasions, between August 31, 1987 and October 19, 1987, the CSE made written requests for an outline of the courses which the applicant proposed to take. No response was received; thus, in the final letter, the applicant was informed that she was in breach of the agreement and was asked to return to work. The applicant submitted to the CHRC that she provided the CSE with "information" on the program she was taking as well as a course calendar on October 3, 1986. She claimed that she chose not to communicate the requested information because she perceived that the CSE had no intention of honouring the agreement.
