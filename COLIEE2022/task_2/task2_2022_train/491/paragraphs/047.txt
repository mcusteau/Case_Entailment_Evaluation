Sopinka, J., held that in order to satisfy the duty of fairness, the CHRC had to inform the parties of the substance of the evidence obtained by the investigator, and which was put before the CHRC. As well, the CHRC was required to give the parties the opportunity to respond to this evidence and make all relevant representations in relation thereto. In making its decision to dismiss the complaint without a tribunal hearing:
"The [CHRC] was entitled to consider the investigator's report, such other underlying material as it, in its discretion, considered necessary and the representations of the parties. The Commission was then obliged to make its own decision based on this information." (
