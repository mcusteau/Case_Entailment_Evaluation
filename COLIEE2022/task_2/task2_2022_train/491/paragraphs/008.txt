Over the subsequent years, several incidents of turbulence occurred between the applicant and her peers at the CSE. During an interview, Mr. Johnston described a "pattern of resistance that he continues to encounter from E. Slattery - constant questioning of his decisions ...". The applicant, for her part, perceived that her authority was being undermined by Mr. Johnston and that there was a general lack of respect for her as an individual and for her position. In particular, it appears from the documentary evidence submitted by the applicant that she was denied crypt training in England on three separate occasions in 1981, 1982 and 1983. The explanation given for this refusal was that the training was of a "basic" nature and that as a Unit Head, she was not entitled to it.
