The rules of the procedural fairness require merely that a complainant know the essence of the case against him or her. In the words of Lord Denning in the case of
Selvarajan v. Race Relations Board
, [1976] 1 All E.R. 12, at p. 19 (C.A.), cited by Justice Sopinka in
S.E.P.Q.A.
(p. 900):
"The fundamental rule is that, if a person may be subjected to pains or penalties, or be exposed to prosecution or proceedings, or deprived of remedies or redress, or in some such way adversely affected by the investigation and report, then he should be told of the case made against him and be afforded a fair opportunity of answering it. The investigating body is, however, master of its own procedure. It need not hold a hearing. It can do everything in writing. It need not allow lawyers. It need not put every detail of the case against a man. Suffice it if the broad grounds are given."
The investigator's conclusion in the case at bar stated that:
"The evidence shows that the complainant's position was disestablished due to a reorganization, and that she refused two offers for positions at her CO-4 level because she wanted to continue working in cryptanalysis, she signed an education leave agreement. There was a dispute over the terms and conditions of the agreement, and the complainant was instructed by the respondent to return to work. When the complainant refused to do so, her employment was terminated.
"There is no evidence that the complainant was treated differently or harassed because of her age and sex.
"It is therefore recommended that the Commission dismiss the complaint because on the evidence the allegation of discrimination is unfounded."
The CHRC's adoption of that conclusion was more than sufficient to provide the applicant with the "broad grounds" of the case against her, given the detailed description of the evidence of the case that was contained in the report.
