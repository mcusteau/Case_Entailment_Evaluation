There is a difference of opinion as to whether the request for education leave was initiated by the applicant or by her employer; regardless, in the spring of 1986, both parties entered negotiations for an agreement for education leave for the applicant. During the period, the applicant requested, and obtained, special leave with pay, which, she submitted, was essential in light of the stress that she had been experiencing at the CSE. Although an agreement was apparently reached in August 1986 between the CSE and the solicitor who was acting on the applicant's behalf, the applicant refused to accept the terms of the agreement, and enrolled in courses of her own choosing at the University of Ottawa.
