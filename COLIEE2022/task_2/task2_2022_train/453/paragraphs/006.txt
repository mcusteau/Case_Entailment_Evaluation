The officer states that much of the material provided deals with the family's efforts to establish and integrate into the community. The officer notes that:
Although establishment can be a factor to consider in assessing hardship for this family...the subjects have provided insufficient evidence to satisfy me that their establishment is such that asking them to apply oversea [sic] would present an excessive hardship.
They have demonstrated that they are highly motivated and dedicated. They all appear to be deeply involved in their church and the community through that church.
The subject came to Canada as a visitor and was granted an extension based on a contract as a pastor at a church. However he commenced unauthorized employment outside the church. When his request to stay was refused and he was asked to leave he made a refugee claim which was refused. He and his family are now subject to effective removal orders.
The subject has not demonstrated that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to warrant an exemption to subsection 11(1) of IRPA.
Based on the evidence provided I am not satisfied that the subject would suffer unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if the subject were to apply for permanent residence from outside of Canada. This application is refused.
