Accordingly, I will apply the standard of reasonableness to my overall review of the officer's decision. The nature of the reasonableness standard was discussed by Justice Iacobucci in Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, 2003 SCC 20 where he stated at paragraph 55:
A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere... This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling ...(citations omitted).
Were the officer's reasons sufficient?
