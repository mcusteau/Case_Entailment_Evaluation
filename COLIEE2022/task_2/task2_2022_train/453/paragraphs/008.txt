As I have concluded that the application must succeed on the primary ground, I do not propose to analyse the procedural fairness issue. However, I will note for the guidance of the next officer to review the file that based on my review of the record, I would not find in this case that the officer did anything incorrect in reviewing the FOSS notes prior to making his decision. There is nothing in the notes filed as part of the certified record that consists of extrinsic evidence improperly considered by the officer. Counsel's submissions in that respect are purely speculative.
