  A review of the Appeal Board's decision reveals that it adopted the same rigid, formalistic approach as the Selection Board, by rejecting the applicants' appeals solely on the basis that they had failed to provide "official transcripts from a university". In dismissing the appeals for that reason, the Appeal Board erred by failing to appreciate the sole purpose for which a transcript was required, namely, to assist the Selection Board in assessing the educational qualifications specified in the screening criteria. In interpreting the requirement of a transcript as a mandatory or absolute condition in the screening process, the Appeal Board further erred by ignoring the fundamental substantive question of whether the applicants were qualified for the positions. As a result, the approach taken by the Appeal Board in its analysis resulted in a violation of the merit principle in that the applicants, who were qualified for the positions, were excluded from the competitions.
