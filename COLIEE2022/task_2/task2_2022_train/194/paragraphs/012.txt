 [12] 
  In a decision dated March 2, 1998, the Chairperson of the Appeal Board dismissed the applicants' appeals for the following reasons: 
 
 
 
 "It is clear from the wording on the competition poster that candidates were expected to provide the Selection Board with specific proof that they had successfully met the education [sic] qualifications listed under the screening criteria for both the Tax Auditor and Excise Auditor positions. Candidates were advised that they  
 must 
  (my underline) provide a copy of an accounting designation, university degree and copies of transcripts in order to substantiate their educational qualifications. Further, candidates were advised that the educational screening criteria must be met by the closing date of the competition poster which was December 20, 1996. Although both appellants had taken the requisite accounting examinations, neither were able to provide the Selection Board with a copy of the transcript by the closing date. Although appellant Hassall went to some lengths to satisfy the Selection Board requirement, the letter from his instructor, in my view, does not equate to the official transcript from a university. Further, that letter was not dated nor received prior to the closing date of the competition."
