  In 1996, Revenue Canada held two closed interdepartmental competitions for vacancies in tax auditor and excise auditor positions at the AU-1 level. Two separate competition posters were used to advertise the vacancies. Each position had a distinct job description, but the duties involved were similar. As a result, some qualifications for the positions were assessed jointly. All candidates who were found by the selection process to be qualified were to be appointed to positions. The closing date for the competitions was December 20, 1996.
