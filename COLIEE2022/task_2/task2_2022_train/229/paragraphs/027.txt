[27]
If I were to determine this application for judicial review not to be moot or to consider the application regardless of mootness, the Applicant raised the following issues: first, whether the PCDO erred in law by ignoring cogent and relevant evidence and in failing to provide reasons for doing so; secondly, whether the PCDO exceeded his or her jurisdiction by reassessing the Applicant's refugee claim rather than determining if there was an objectively identifiable risk to the Applicant if she were returned to the Ukraine; and thirdly, whether the PCDO breached the duty of fairness that he or she owed to the Applicant by failing to provide the Applicant with a copy of her risk assessment before issuing it and therefore failing to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to respond to the risk assessment.
