In
Ahmed et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
[see footnote 7], my colleague Justice Tremblay-Lamer wrote at paragraph 23:
"In the present case, it appears that the PCDO has in fact substituted her opinion for that of the Refugee Division. In my view, the PCDO conducted a new refugee determination analysis rather than a risk analysis, re-evaluating the applicant's credibility, and thus exceeding her jurisdiction."
While the foregoing is, I am satisfied, an overstatement on the facts before me, it is nonetheless applicable in substance with regard to elements of the PCDO's analysis here under review. Justice Tremblay-Lamer continued at paragraph 25 of her reasons:
"The present case is an ideal illustration of the PDRCC process operating as a safety net. The applicant's fear may have been outside the scope of protection offered by the Convention, nevertheless, there may very well be a risk to his life if he were to return to Bangladesh."
