In
Mia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
[see footnote 9], Justice McKeown wrote at paragraph 11:
"With respect, I disagree that the principles of fairness require a PCDO conducting a risk assessment to determine if the applicant is a member of the PDRCC class to disclose the risk assessment prior to making his decision. In my view, this would be tantamount to a decision-maker being required to provide its reasons for the decision for comment prior to making the final decision. This is a case where the person who reviewed the evidence made the decision. No one else was involved. This is not a case where the decision maker is receiving input from other persons than the applicant. ..."
I prefer the decision of Justice McKeown on this issue. I find no reviewable error on the part of the PCDO in the nature of breach of the duty of fairness owed by him or her to the Applicant.
