With regard to the psychological report referred to by the CRDD and letters from the Applicant's son, the PCDO wrote:
"I have taken into consideration the letters supplied by the applicant's son, relating to the threats and can give these letters
no probative weight
. In addition, I have read the psychological report provided by Dr. Marc Nesca. I note the panel was satisfied with the doctor's diagnosis that the applicant suffers from post-traumatic stress syndrome, but this information
in itself
is not enough for me to find the applicant faces an objectively identifiable risk upon return to Ukraine." (emphasis added)
