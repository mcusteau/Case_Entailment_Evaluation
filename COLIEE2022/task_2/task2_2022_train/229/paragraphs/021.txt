The PCDO wrote:
"While I note the pervasiveness of organized crime in Ukraine and the evidence of police corruption in that country, the applicant has advanced

I note in passing the distinction between this finding and that of the CRDD.

He or she concluded:
"... I cannot agree that there is a causal connection between the police being unable to proceed further with their investigation and corruption that links the police with the criminal element in Ukraine."
