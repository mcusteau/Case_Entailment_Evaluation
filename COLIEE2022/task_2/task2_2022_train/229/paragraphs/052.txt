[52]
If I interpret the foregoing provision correctly, when the Applicant receives the pre-removal risk assessment that the Respondent acknowledges she is entitled to, the officer conducting the pre-removal risk assessment will be entitled to rely only on new evidence that arose after the rejection of the Applicant's refugee claim or evidence that was not reasonably available or that the Applicant could not have reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time her refugee claim was considered.
