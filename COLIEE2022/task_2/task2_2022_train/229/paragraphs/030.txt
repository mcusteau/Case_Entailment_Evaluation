In
Ramoutar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
[see footnote 6], Justice Rothstein wrote at page 377 [F.C.]:
"In this case, a decision very damaging to the applicant is now part of the applicant's record for immigration purposes. That decision could have an adverse effect on the applicant in any further proceedings he may wish to bring under Canada's immigration laws."
