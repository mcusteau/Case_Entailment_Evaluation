Justice Rothstein continued at page 378 [F.C.]:
"Even if the case were moot, I would exercise my discretion to decide it. The adversarial relationship between the parties continues. There are collateral consequences to the applicant if the decision appealed from is allowed to stand. And this is not a case in which a decision by this Court could reasonably be considered to be an intrusion into the functions of the legislative branch of government."
