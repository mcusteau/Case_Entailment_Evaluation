  Alternatively, the Respondents oppose the Applicants' request to have the two matters reviewed in one application for judicial review as they say the two decisions involve significant factual differences, different decision-makers acting at different times and making different decisions based on different information, and that the parties directly affected by each decision are not the same. It is the Respondents' submission that Rod Neske seized and detained the shipment of Empowerplus on April 17, 2003 pursuant to s. 23 of the  
 Food and Drugs Act 
 , whereas Sandra Jarvis never seized and detained the May shipment, and she recommended the shipment be released into Canada, which Canada Customs and Revenue Agency permitted. The Respondents also submit that Neske and Jarvis relied on different facts, that is, while both received invoices and promotional material, Neske relied on additional information about the way in which individuals had purchased Empowerplus, information which Jarvis did not have with respect to the May shipment.
