  The Applicants take the position that the factual background of each seizure is very similar: both decisions were made by an individual who was the Acting Operations Manager of the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate of Health Canada for western Canada, being Rod Neske for the April shipment and Sandra Jarvis for the May shipment; and both individuals decided on seizure because they determined that Empowerplus is a "drug" and the shipments were commercial importations, in violation of the personal importation policy of Health Canada. The Applicants emphasize that both decisions were government actions that were part of a continuing program of enforcement against the importation and sale of Empowerplus.
