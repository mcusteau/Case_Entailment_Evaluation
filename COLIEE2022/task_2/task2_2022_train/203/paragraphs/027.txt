  The Court is not prepared to dictate that the reevaluation be made under an Act and Regulations that are no longer in force. The Court agrees with Gibson, J., who said at para. 31 in  
 Hilewitz v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2002), 221 F.T.R. 213; 2000 FCT 844 (T.D.): 
 
 
 
 "... I am satisfied that an order of this Court referring this matter back for redetermination in accordance with the  
 Immigration Act 
  and  
 Regulations 
  would in effect be inconsistent with law."
