I conclude from this that it is indeed more likely than not that if Pharmascience were to file its evidence first, it would serve to substantially narrow the issues to be litigated in this matter and that it is likely that fewer expert witnesses would be needed. The fewer the experts and the narrower the issues, the more limited the risk that reply evidence will be sought or allowed. Also, experts are notably busy, and securing their availabilities for cross-examination represents the bulk of the time usually provided for cross examinations. The fewer the experts, the less time will be necessary to coordinate, schedule and conduct their cross-examinations. This results in a less expensive determination of the issues as well as a more expeditious one.
