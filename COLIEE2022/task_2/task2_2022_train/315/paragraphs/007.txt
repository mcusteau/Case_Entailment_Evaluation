I am satisfied that the Court has, in the context of case management, discretion to vary the order in which evidence of the parties on an application is to be served and filed if it is satisfied that it is necessary for the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of the proceedings on its merits. That discretion is contemplated in Rule 385(1)(a). Additional support for this proposition, if needed, can be found in Rule 55, which allows the Court to vary a rule or dispense with compliance in special circumstances. An analogy may also be drawn with Rule 274, which sets out the order in which evidence is to be led at a trial, but specifically provides that the Court may direct otherwise.
