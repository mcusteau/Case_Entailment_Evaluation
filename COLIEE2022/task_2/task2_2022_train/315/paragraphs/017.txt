Of course, there can be no certainty in this, especially since both parties can, in the circumstances of this particular case and depending on the order in which they would be filing their evidence, argue with some justification that motions for leave to file reply evidence are likely to be required and might delay the scheduling and completion of cross-examinations of experts. Nevertheless, I remain convinced that in the circumstances of this case, it is more likely than not that reversing the order in which evidence is to be brought, at least with respect to invalidity issues, would substantially narrow the issues and lead to a just, less expensive and more expeditious resolution of the issues in this application. There is, to this, an important caveat: The savings in time and expenses can only, in my view, be achieved to their full extent if both parties are committed to this process and embrace it fully, so as to extend to each other the cooperation and transparency necessary to this purpose. Indeed, the very complexity of the issues and the awkwardness created by the partial reversal needed to deal with the allegations of non-infringement, lack of sound prediction and over-broadness, would require a high degree of cooperation between the parties.
