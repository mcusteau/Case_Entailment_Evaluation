Having heard the parties' representations at length, and having personally been charged with the case management of the earlier application involving Novopharm, I consider that there is a distinct possibility, if both parties should obtain leave to have more than 5 experts each, and if motions for leave to file reply evidence are brought, that this matter will not be capable of being prosecuted with the 24-month period contemplated in the
Regulations
. On the record before me, if the litigation proceeds in the regular fashion, that may well happen.
