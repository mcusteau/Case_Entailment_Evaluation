As regards the non-infringement allegations, the Applicant concedes that the most important factor in narrowing the issues will be its own review of Pharmascience's formulation, dissolution and pharmacokinetic information, and its determination of which claims of the patent it intends to assert would be infringed. Until that is done, asking Pharmascience to file its evidence first would not narrow the issues and would instead force Pharmascience to file evidence on issues that may never be contested. The Applicant suggest that this initial narrowing of the non-infringement issues can be accomplished within some 21 days, by it receiving and reviewing Pharmascience's information and then advising, probably by way of an amended notice of application, which claims of the patent it asserts would be infringed. The Applicant goes on to suggest that if, from there, Pharmascience was required to file its evidence first, there would be an opportunity to further narrow the issues as Pharmascience might abandon some of its claims of non-infringement. The period of time required for the affidavits of both parties to be filed under this suggestion would be of 110 days, as opposed to 150 days under the schedule otherwise contemplated by the parties, a savings of 40 days. Although I agree that there would be some potential for the further narrowing of the issues anticipated by the Applicant, the bulk of the issues to be narrowed would be narrowed in any event under normal process. I am not certain that the potential additional narrowing would be substantial enough, and the savings in time substantial enough to justify forcing Pharmascience to file its evidence on infringement first in the absence of its consent, especially since it appears to me that the non-infringement issues are much less voluminous and complex than the invalidity issues, and that the invalidity issues will likely dictate the pace at which this application can proceed.
