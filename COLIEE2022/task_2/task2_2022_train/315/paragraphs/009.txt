The parties before me generally concurred that the present case involves particularly complex issues of construction and invalidity. There are, in addition, non-infringement issues. The Respondent's notice of allegation runs to 93 pages, alleges some 13 grounds of invalidity and further incorporates a notice of allegation previously issued by Novopharm with respect to the same drug, which itself gave rise to an extremely lengthy and complex prohibition application. (The application was eventually settled, but only after all evidence had been filed, including reply evidence).
