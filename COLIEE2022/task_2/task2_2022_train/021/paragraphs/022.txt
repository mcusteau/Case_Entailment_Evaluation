  On the issue of Chadwick, J.'s, judgment in the applicant's action against the respondent, the record makes clear that this was furnished by the applicant who presumably considered it was material to the issue before the Commission. Although there is no way of determining how much weight was given to that judgment, I am of the opinion that it is well within the Commission's discretion to ascribe to it any weight it wishes.
