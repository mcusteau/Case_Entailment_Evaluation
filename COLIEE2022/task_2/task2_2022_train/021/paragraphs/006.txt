  The applicant alleges that the Mint, as well as its witness on examination for discovery, deliberately misled the court and that the Mint and the Department of Justice withheld relevant documents from her and filed an incomplete Affidavit of Documents [see footnote 5]. The applicant believes that these actions affected the outcome of the Ontario Court trial. The applicant also believes that Mr. Justice Chadwick made some mistakes in his judgment. The decision of Mr. Justice Chadwick is under appeal and the actions of the Mint and the Department of Justice are part of the grounds of appeal [see footnote 6].
