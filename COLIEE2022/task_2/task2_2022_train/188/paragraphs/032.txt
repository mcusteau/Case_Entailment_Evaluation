  Where counsel for the respondent's argument misses the mark, in my opinion, is that the  
 Act 
  requires a citizenship application to satisfy  
 positively 
  the criteria of living in Canada, i.e., presence in Canada. An applicant for Canadian citizenship cannot satisfy this requirement by proving a negative - that of having no other place in any other country because his family is in Canada.
