  The recent jurisprudence of this court in citizenship matters guiding an assessment of whether or not the residency requirements under s. 5(1)(c) of the  
 Act 
  have been met has emphasized, in my view, the following principles: 
 
 
 
 (1) In accordance with the intent of Parliament gleaned from a reading of the statute as well as considering the purpose of the residency requirement, living in Canada, being present in Canada, is by far the most important factor. 
 
 
 
 (2) The residency analysis must be separated into two components: the establishment of residency and the maintenance of residency.
