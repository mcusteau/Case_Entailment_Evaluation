  After examining all of the evidence, I am satisfied the respondent did not establish residency in Canada before leaving on his substantial trips abroad. He did not meet the test in  
 Re Koo 
  of "regularly, normally or customarily living in Canada". In essence, what the respondent did, during the relevant period, was to consult and work for a United Arab Emerate company which necessitated his being absent from Canada for long and non-temporary periods of time. While the respondent's absences from Canada contributed to the welfare of his family in Canada, this factor cannot override the clear requirements established by Parliament under the  
 Act 
 . I cannot see in the evidence in what manner the respondent established himself in Canada by integrating himself into Canadian society. It seems to me that this case is quite similar to the  
 Cheung 
  case, supra, decided by Nadon, J.
