Upon his arrival in Canada, the applicant rented an apartment at 2445 Sunset, Town of Mount Royal, Quebec, (where he lives to this day) incorporated a company and started to lead a life with a pattern similar to many businessmen who are Canadian citizens. The applicant's children were enrolled in a Canadian school when they reached school age. The applicant's wife and children became Canadian citizens (one child was born in Canada in 1997). The applicant filed income tax declaration forms in Canada for every year since he became a permanent resident in Canada. I carefully examined applicant's absences from Canada which were frequent but due to the nature of his business I believe (ineligible) ... There is no doubt in my mind that his trips (ineligible) ... The applicant's parents are deceased and his closest relatives are his children and his wife who are Canadian citizens. All of these facts lead me to believe that this applicant has centralized his life in Canada and therefore the applicant has complied with paragraph 5(1)(c) of the  
 Act 
  and I approve this application."
