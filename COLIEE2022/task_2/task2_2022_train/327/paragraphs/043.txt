What can be seen from a review of Ms. Gollan's professional work, as described in her fee accounts, is that she had a significant financial interest in maintaining her retainer with Sweetgrass, and that she had a close working relationship with Chief Atcheynum, including the provision of legal advice and services on his personal behalf. I do not mean to suggest that it was inappropriate for Sweetgrass to have paid for Ms. Gollan's services in representing Chief Atcheynum. In all likelihood, his need for legal representation was a consequence of his role as Chief. However, the fact remains that Ms. Gollan acted as legal counsel for Chief Atcheynum. At one point, she also provided advice to him about a possible libel action against Chief Standinghorn and the Battlefords Tribal Council. It is noteworthy that Battlefords Tribal Council was one of the Defendants in the Sweetgrass/Atcheynum lawsuit described above. Ms. Gollan's affidavit makes the following connection between this earlier consultation with Chief Atcheynum and the subsequent litigation:
"In January, 2005, the Chief and Councilor [sic] Paskemin inquired about the First Nation bringing a liable [sic] action against Wayne Standinghorn, Battlefords Tribal Council, and the Radio Station, for comments that were aired
regarding a potential lawsuit against Battlefords Tribal Council
. I advised that this was a matter that they should discuss further with the lawyer who would be representing them in that action." (emphasis added)
