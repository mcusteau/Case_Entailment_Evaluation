I would add that, if Band Council had the authority under the
Act
to appoint Ms. Weenie to the Tribunal in advance of the election, it surely had the authority to replace her provided that it acted in good faith and for valid reasons. In these circumstances two (2) of the candidates standing for election were closely related to Ms. Weenie whereas her replacement, Mr. Paskemin, had no family conflicts. The suggestion made after the election that Ms. Weenie should be re-instated to the Tribunal in the face of an appeal challenging the election of her adopted brother as Chief is startling. If the current Council is truly committed to a fair, open and impartial appeal process, it surely does not achieve that result by attempting to oust Mr. Paskemin in favour of Ms. Weenie. I do not mean to suggest by this that Ms. Weenie would not endeavour to honestly and dutifully conduct herself in this role, but only that the appearance of such a conflict would not engender the confidence of most fair-minded electors. In addition, based on the Record placed before me, there is no indication that Ms. Weenie objected to her removal at the time or wishes now to be reappointed to the Tribunal. In the absence of any stated position from her, the inference that I draw is that she accepted the Council's decision to substitute Mr. Paskemin along with its reasons for doing so.
