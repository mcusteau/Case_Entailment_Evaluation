Sweetgrass has challenged the right of Mr. Paskemin to sit as a member of the Tribunal based upon a further technical argument. Sweetgrass does not say that he is disqualified from acting on the ground of bias. Sweetgrass contends that Mr. Paskemin's appointment was irregular and not in conformity with the
Act
and that the earlier appointment of Ms. Weenie should be restored. Some concern has also now been expressed about Mr. Paskemin's ability to dispassionately sit in judgment of the election in the face of this challenge to his membership on the Tribunal. Sweetgrass argues that there is benefit in having an effective sweep of the Tribunal with replacements who can be seen to be objective and impartial.
