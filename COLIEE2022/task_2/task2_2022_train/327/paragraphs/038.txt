The situation of Ms. Gollan as Tribunal Chair is more complicated and difficult. While the contention by Sweetgrass that Ms. Gollan was in a position of actual bias was never abandoned, it was also not an argument that was advanced with much vigour. I can find nothing in the evidence to support an allegation of actual bias and, indeed, she appears to have acted at all times out of a sense of responsibility to maintain the integrity of the election appeal process. There are, however, a number of aspects of Ms. Gollan's prior involvement in the legal affairs of Sweetgrass and Chief Atcheynum which indicate quite clearly that she cannot continue to sit on the Tribunal.
