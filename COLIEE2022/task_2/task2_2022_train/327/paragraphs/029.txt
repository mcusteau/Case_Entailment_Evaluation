It is clear to me that this and other time requirements stipulated by the
Act
are directory and not mandatory in nature. It could not have been intended by the Band that appointment or election processes would be automatically nullified by failure to strictly observe such provisions, particularly in Ms. Gollan's case where the deviation was only two (2) days. This argument is also negated by the obvious need to periodically replace Tribunal members or electoral officers who withdraw (eg. Fred Paskemin). Band Council has to have the authority to name replacements and not be hamstrung with timing requirements that cannot be met or which are inconsequential to the completion of a fair election.
