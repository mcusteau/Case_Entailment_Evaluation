In the course of his submissions, counsel for Sweetgrass acknowledged that no relief was being sought as against the Defendant, Virginia Favel. He conceded that Ms. Favel was properly appointed to the Tribunal and should continue to serve in that capacity. Sweetgrass continues, however, to challenge the right of the other two Defendants to sit as members of the Tribunal, albeit that it pressed the point more assertively with respect to Ms. Gollan than with respect to Mr. Paskemin. Sweetgrass contends that Ms. Gollan is disqualified from sitting on the Tribunal because of bias and because of appointment irregularities. In the case of Mr. Paskemin, it is argued that his appointment was irregular and, therefore, cannot be maintained.
