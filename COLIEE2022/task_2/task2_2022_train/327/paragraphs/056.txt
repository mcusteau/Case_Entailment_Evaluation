In the result, I intend only to order the removal of Ms. Gollan as Tribunal Chair and I will leave the selection of her replacement to the Band's current elected representatives. I would direct, however, that the selection of a replacement for Ms. Gollan shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date of this judgment and, thereafter, the Tribunal shall proceed in accordance with all of the other requirements of the
Act
