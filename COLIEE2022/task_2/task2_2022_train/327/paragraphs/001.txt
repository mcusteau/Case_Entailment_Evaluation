Barnes, J.
: At the core of this dispute is an election of the Chief and the Band Council which took place on November 13, 2005. When this proceeding was commenced, the Plaintiff, Sweetgrass First Nation (Sweetgrass), sought both declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the Defendants, Lori Gollan, Virginia Favel and Myron Paskemin, from continuing to act as the members of the Band's Election Tribunal (Tribunal). Sweetgrass now seeks to replace two of the Defendants (Lori Gollan and Myron Paskemin) with its own nominees to the Tribunal, namely Robert Pelton, Q.C., and Sylvia Weenie. In order to preserve the status quo, an injunction was issued in favour of the Plaintiff by Justice Simon NoÃ«l on January 12, 2006 that was to continue in force until the determination of this proceeding on the merits. That injunction prevented the Tribunal from acting under its mandate to review the election which had been contested by one of the unsuccessful candidates.
