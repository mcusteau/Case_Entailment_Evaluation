The stated rationale for Mr. Paskemin's removal, as reflected in the resolution of the newly-elected Council dated November 18, 2005, is that there was no formal BCR to support his appointment to the Tribunal on November 8, 2005. That contention is refuted by the existence of a properly executed BCR provided to legal counsel for the Band by Ms. Gollan on November 29, 2005 and by the recitals in the Council Resolution of November 18, 2005. The fact that a signed copy of this BCR apparently could not be located in the Band Office is not a basis for concluding that any procedural irregularity occurred, particularly in the face of a documentary record which seems regular on its face.
