Although Ms. Gollan's affidavit purports to minimize the significance of this consultation by saying that she referred the matter to "the lawyer who would be representing them in that action", she nevertheless did consult with Chief Atcheynum about a possible legal action against Chief Standinghorn. Ultimately, she became one of the lawyers acting on behalf of Sweetgrass and Chief Atcheynum in the proceeding brought against Battlefords Tribal Council. Although Chief Standinghorn is not a party to that proceeding, it is obvious from Ms. Gollan's affidavit that the issues arising in that litigation had a connection to Chief Standinghorn and were part and parcel of a rivalry between Chief Atcheynum and Chief Standinghorn.
