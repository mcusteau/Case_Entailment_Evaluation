Recent decisions of the Court of Appeal require a sufficient analysis in the decision of the conflicting evidence to determine if there has been a meaningful and effective change. Marceau, J.A., in
Ahmed v. Minis­ter of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 156 N.R. 221 (F.C.A.), at pp. 223-224 stated:
"While counsel for the appellant disputes the validity of these two reasons advanced by the tribunal in support of its conclusion, counsel for the respondent replies very simply that they constitute findings of facts for which support can be found in the evidence and with which, therefore, this court should not interfere. We know that the position taken by counsel for the re­spondent is traditional in appeals against decisions supported by similar findings, but still we do not believe that it is wholly satisfactory.

"... Similarly, the mere fact that there has been a change of government is clearly not in itself sufficient to meet the requirements of a change of circumstances which have rendered the genuine fear of a claimant unreasonable and hence without founda­tion.
"... the mere declarations of the new four-month old government that it favoured the establishment of law and order can hardly be seen, when the root the appellant's fear and the past record of the new government with respect to human rights violations are considered, as a clear indication of the meaningful and effective change which is required to expunge the objective founda­tion of the appellant's claim. But, in any event, even if the conclusions of the tribu­nal were correct, we do not accept that they can be advanced without more expla­nation to establish that the appropriate legal principles were applied. The appli­cant's claim was not properly dealt with and the decision cannot be allowed to stand."
