Although the Board reviewed credibility its conclusions are primarily based on the change in country conditions. The Board found at p. 6 that:
"As a result of the magnitude of this democratization process, the panel finds that the claimant's fear of persecution for any of the grounds enumerated in the
Immi足gration Act
to be, less than a mere possi足bility.
"The onus is on the claimant, to establish through evidence that he has a well-founded of persecution for any one of the grounds in the definition of Convention refugee in the
Immigration Act
, if he were to return to Ghana. The claimant failed to establish this.
"The Refugee Division, after considering the entire evidence, both written and oral, and for the above reasons, is not persuaded that there are any good grounds for the claimant to fear persecution for any of the grounds in the
Immigration Act
, should he return to Ghana.
"Therefore, the Refugee Division deter足mines, Ebenezer Oduro is not a Conven足tion refugee."
