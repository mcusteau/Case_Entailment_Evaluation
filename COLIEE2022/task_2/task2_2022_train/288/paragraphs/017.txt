In view of my findings on change of country conditions I need not deal with the question as to whether I should follow the reasons of my learned colleague Rouleau, J., in
Bovbel v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 70 F.T.R. 66 (T.D.). I also do not need to deal with the portions of a memorandum relating to the credibility of applicants from Ghana written by an admin­istrative officer of the Board since there was no evidence before me that the memorandum was ever seen by the two members of the Board who heard this case. However, with­out deciding whether the latter memorandum is a sufficient breach of natural justice to require the matter to be returned to the Board, the Board should rescind the portion of the memorandum relating to credibility of claimants from Ghana and make it clear that it is up to the two members sitting on the case to determine the credibility of the claimants before them. There can be no consistency on findings of credibility. The Board is entitled to provide its members with training programs where the members can be instructed on matters to be considered or of assistance in the determination of the claimant's credibility.
Application allowed.
