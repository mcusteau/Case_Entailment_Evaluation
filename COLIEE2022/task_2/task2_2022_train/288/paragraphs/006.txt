Wetston, J., in
Kassim v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, supra, at pp. 129-130 reviewed the principles of change in country conditions as expressed in the recent Federal Court of Appeal decisions succinctly. He concluded on facts similar to this matter that a recent change in the con­stitution when there was no change in a government which had a lamentable human rights record was insufficient to conclude that there is "a clear indication of the mean­ingful and effective change which is required" to negate the objective basis to the applicant's claims.
