It is true that rescinding resolution 67 would not invalidate the decisions made by the Executive Committee, and this is not, in fact, what the applicant is seeking. While he still objects to the creation of this Committee, the issue before me is not whether the Committee was properly constituted. The sole impact of rescinding resolution 67 would be to make it possible to challenge a decision made by the Committee on the ground that it acted outside the purview of the powers granted to it by the I.T.U.M. Council and thus did not give the respondents the possibility of pleading an ex post facto ratification of this decision. For this reason, I therefore disagree with the respondents that the rescission of resolution 67 would have no legal impact.
