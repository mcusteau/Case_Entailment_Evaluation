The hiring of a special consultant does not appear to me to be part of the Band’s day-to-day administrative activities: the terms and conditions of the contract, the nature of the duties described and the level of remuneration do not evince a standard type contract. Moreover, the amendments to Mr. Sioui’s contract provided in resolution 64 cannot be said to have been authorized by the August 8, 2002 resolution which authorized the Chief to extend the term of all the contract workers’ employment contracts until December 31, 2004 in order to ensure a smooth transition after the elections. The amendment to Mr. Sioui’s contract, which provides for the payment to him of a $58,557.63 compensation in the event of his resignation, goes well beyond the letter and spirit of this resolution.
