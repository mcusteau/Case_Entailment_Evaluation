In this case, I do not think that the pragmatic and functional approach dictates a standard of review that is different from the one pertaining to the ultra vires doctrine. Firstly, I note that the
Indian Act
does not immunize decisions made by a band council through a privative clause. Secondly, I do not think that the Band Council was in a better position than this Court to determine if it was authorized by the
Indian Act
to act as it did. It is true that the I.T.U.M. Council was required to understand the situation at hand in order to make a decision that would be in the Band’s best interest, and the Court should fully defer to the Council on this level. However, the issue before us is not whether the Council was right in acting the way it did, but whether it was empowered to do so. Its expertise in this regard is certainly not superior to that of the Court. The third factor in this pragmatic and functional analysis, namely the legislator’s objective in granting the governance of the Band to the Council, is of particular importance. Parliament granted a high level of autonomy to the authority elected by the band members in administering their affairs, and this objective should be fully respected by the courts. However, as with municipal councils, it remains that the decisions must be made within the parameters set by the law; this will ensure that the will of the members is respected and that their best interests are taken into consideration. Finally, the issue whether the Council had the power to follow the chosen procedure in adopting resolutions 64 and 67 is undeniably a legal issue. On the basis of these four factors, I have come to the conclusion that these decisions should be reviewed according to the standard of the correctness. It follows that I am not called upon to exercise great restraint.
Were resolutions 64 and 67 validly adopted?
