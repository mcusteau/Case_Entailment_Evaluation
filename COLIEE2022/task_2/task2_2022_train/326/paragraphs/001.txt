[Translation]: The applicant, Albert Vollant, has filed two applications for judicial review, in which he asked that two resolutions adopted by the Innu Takuaikan Uashat Mak Mani-Utenam Band Council (I.T.U.M. Council) be set aside. The first of these resolutions bearing number 04-05-64 (resolution 64) on June 23, 2004, was filed under docket number T-1837-04; the second challenged resolution bearing number 04-05-67 (resolution 67) on June 30, 2004, was filed under docket number T-1532-04. As both of these applications arise from the same context, raise the same legal issues and were examined at the same time, it seemed to me more convenient to discuss them jointly in these reasons for judgment.
