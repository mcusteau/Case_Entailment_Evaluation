[27]
It rather appears to me that the applicant wanted to establish that some of the decisions made by the Executive Committee may be illegal and that it is therefore necessary to question the legality of resolution 67 that would result in the retroactive validation of all the decisions made by the Executive Committee. If resolution 67 were to be declared null and void, the decisions made by the Executive Committee would not be necessarily invalidated. As the applicant submitted, invalidating resolution 67 would only entail challenging the Executive Committeeâ€™s decisions one by one.
