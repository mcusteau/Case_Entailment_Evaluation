At the outset, it must be said that, by this argument, the respondents are just speculating. It is quite possible that, without the compensation he was entitled to pursuant to resolution 64, Mr. Sioui would not have resigned. It is also possible that the new Chief would not have let him remain in his position as special consultant. Finally, it is entirely conceivable that Mr. Sioui felt physically threatened following the elections. That being said, one cannot conclude with certainty that he could have invoked the clause in his contract providing for severance pay in the event of a rescission of his contract or of his inability to perform his duties.
