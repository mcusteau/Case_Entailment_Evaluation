The respondents submitted that the remedy sought against resolution 67 was simply a roundabout way of attacking the creation of the Executive Committee, almost three years after it came into existence. It is true that a review of the evidence offered by both parties and of the applicantâ€™s brief clearly shows that the applicant and the deponents who supported his application never accepted the creation of the Executive Committee and questioned the legitimacy of this body as well as the way it makes decisions. But I do not think that this is sufficient to call into question what is really at stake in this litigation.
