It seems to me that there are good reasons why decisions that affect the entire band may only be made in the course of a public meeting duly convened with the participation of all the elected members. In a democracy, ideas expressed within the framework of a forum where all viewpoints are welcome provide the best assurance that everyoneâ€™s rights are respected and that the interests of the community are protected. This objective may be at times set aside in the interest of expeditiousness and efficiency in the business world, but this should never be the case when the welfare of members of a public body is at stake. The risks are too great to allow the slightest deviation from this rule.
