  By letter of June 3, 1991, then counsel for the applicant wrote to the CRDD enclosing a copy of the letter from the applicant's parents with a translation, and a copy of the letter from Mr. Mladenov's physician in St. John's. Counsel referred to the applicant's claim to refugee status and requested that the enclosed letters be considered in relation to the decision which was then in reserve. A month later, on July 5, 1991, that decision was rendered, the board then finding the applicant was not a Convention refugee. In that decision no reference is made by the board members to the letters received from counsel and the decision includes no reference to the matters dealt with in those letters.
