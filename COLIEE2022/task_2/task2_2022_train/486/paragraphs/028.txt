In my view the evolving jurisprudence relating to s. 15(1) of the
Charter
as it applies to rights claimed by persons of a homosexual or lesbian orientation is by no means settled. In the circumstances of this case, had the trial been held, the court might have concluded on the basis of the evidence and argument that the relief included in the judgment, rendered on the joint request of the parties, was warranted. Thus, on the basis of facts admitted in the pleadings, evidence adduced at trial, and argument, the court might well have been persuaded to exercise its discretion to grant the first of the declarations included in the judgment granted, concerning the plaintiff's rights in light of s. 15(1) of the
Charter
. While the exercise of discretion to grant the second of the declarations might have required more persuasive argument, for that declaration deals with general policies of the defendant within the Canadian Armed Forces and not merely with the plaintiff's rights as affected by the application of those policies, since the general application of those policies in light of the
Charter
was clearly in issue, the second of the declarations would have been within the court's discretion to grant after trial, had it been held.
