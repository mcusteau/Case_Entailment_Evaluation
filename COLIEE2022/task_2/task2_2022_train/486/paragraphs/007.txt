[7]
The policy applicable in the Canadian Armed Forces is described in the statement of claim, and admitted by the statement of defence filed on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen, in the following terms:
"15. The Canadian Armed Forces Administrative Order (CFAO) 19-20 provides in para. 7 thereof:
'Service policy does not allow homosexual members or members with a sexual abnormality to be retained in the CF.'
and further provides in para. 8 thereof that in such a case a member is to be released under Item 5(d) of the table to Queen's Regulations and Orders (Q.R. + O.) 15.01, made pursuant the
National Defence Act
.
"16. Item 5(d) of Q.R. + O. 15.01 is a category under 'Reasons for Release' headed 'Not Advantageously Employable'. The 'Special Instructions' incorporated as part of Item 5(d) of Q.R. + O. 15.01 indicate that this item:
'applies to the release of an officer or man because of an inherent lack of ability or aptitude to meet military classification or trade standards, or who is unable to adapt to military life; or who, either wholly or chiefly because of the conditions of military life or other factors beyond his control, develops personal weaknesses or has domestic or other personal problems that seriously impair his usefulness to or impose an excessive administrative burden on the Canadian Forces.'
"17. On the 11th of February, 1987 CFAO 19-20 was modified to provide that if a member of the Canadian Forces refuses to take a release under Item 5(d) of Q.R. + O. 15.01 then that member will be retained 'with career restrictions' in the Canadian Forces while the policy is being reviewed. As a career restricted officer the plaintiff would have been ineligible for promotion, conversion of her present terms of service, posting outside the geographic area or transfer to the Reserve Force. In addition she would have been ineligible for further qualification courses or training except that required for her to carry out restricted employment."
