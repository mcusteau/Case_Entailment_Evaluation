By the statement of defence filed March 21, 1990, on behalf of the defendant Her Majesty the Queen, the Deputy Attorney General of Canada admits that the Canadian Forces are subject to the requirements of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, 1982. He denies that the Forces' interim policy and actions infringe the plaintiff's rights and freedoms pursuant to those sections of the
Charter
identified by the plaintiff, and submits that in the alternative if the Forces' policy and actions have infringed the plaintiff's rights and freedoms pursuant to the
Charter
, then "they constitute a reasonable limit which is demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society under s. 1 of the
Charter
".
