By its terms the judgment grants to the plaintiff two declarations. The first is that her rights under the
Charter
, in particular s. 15(1) have been denied by the defendant. The second goes beyond the rights claimed by the plaintiff and declares the defendant's policies regarding service of homosexuals in the Canadian Armed Forces to be contrary to the
Charter
. I note that both declarations are within the scope of somewhat wider declaratory orders sought as relief by the plaintiff's statement of claim.
