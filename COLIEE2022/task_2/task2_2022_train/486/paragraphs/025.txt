In
Egan and Nesbit v. Canada
, [1992] 1 F.C. 687; 47 F.T.R. 305 (T.D.) Mr. Justice Martin dismissed an application for a declaration that the
Old Age Security Act
, was unconstitutional. Its limitation of a spouse's allowance to a person of the opposite sex living with another if the two have publicly represented themselves as husband and wife, which was found to exclude persons living in a continuing homosexual relationship as well as other persons living together, was found not to be discriminatory on the basis of sex or sexual orientation within s. 15(1). Martin, J., found that
Act
did not infringe the plaintiff's s. 15(1) rights for it was not discriminatory within the meaning of s. 15(1).
