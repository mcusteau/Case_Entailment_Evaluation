[24]
In
Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop
, [1991] 1 F.C. 18; 114 N.R. 241 (F.C.A.) (leave granted to appeal, Jan. 25, 1991, S.C.C. Bulletin p. 157 No. 23145), the Court of Appeal set aside a decision of a tribunal appointed under the
Canadian Human Rights Act
which had found that failure to accord bereavement leave to a person in a continuing homosexual relationship on the same basis as provided to a person in a heterosexual spousal relationship constituted discrimination proscribed in relation to "family status" under that
Act
. The court declined to consider that limiting "family status" as excluding homosexual relationships, constituted discrimination prohibited under the
Act
, which did not expressly prohibit discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. Assuming (without deciding this issue) that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation was prohibited under s. 15(1) of the
Charter
, the court found this would not permit reading into the
Human Rights Act
such a proscription which that
Act
did not include.
