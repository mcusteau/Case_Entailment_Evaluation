The plaintiff joined the Armed Forces on November 26, 1986, as a direct entry officer. In the following March she graduated from basic training at the top of her class, received a senior parade appointment and was promoted to the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. From March to August 1987 she successfully completed French language training, and in September she was posted to the Military Police following her earlier top secret security clearance, essential for that posting. From November 1987 to May 1988 she was posted to basic security officer training, a course from which she graduated first in her class. She ought then to have been appointed to the rank of 1st Lieutenant but was not at that time, the defendant says by a mere oversight. In June 1988 she was assigned to central detachment of the Special Investigations Unit as an operations officer. In late June and July of that year she was interviewed on more than one occasion by senior officers concerning her sexual orientation and in July she admitted she was a lesbian, after having earlier denied this. She was then transferred from the Military Police and was transferred to Toronto as base protocol officer/information officer/co-ordinator of official languages.
