In the case at bar, in spite of the fact that the borrowed money was used by a company to redeem its shares and, thus, was not directly used to earn income, the plaintiff argued that the interest paid on the relevant loans still ought to be deductible, based on the Trans-Prairie case (Trans-Prairie Pipelines Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue, 70 D.T.C. 6351), a decision of Jackett, P., in the Exchequer Court, which was also referred to in the Bronfman Trust case (supra) and summarized as follows, at page 5062:
"In that case the taxpayer corporation wanted to raise capital by way of bond issues for expansion of its business. It discovered, however, that it was impossible, practically speaking, to float a bond issue unless it first redeemed its preferred shares, because of the sinking fund requirements of its preferred share issue. Accordingly, the taxpayer borrowed $700,000, used $400,000 to redeem the preferred shares and the remaining $300,000 for expansion of its business. Jackett, P., held that interest payments on the entire $700,000 loan deductible.
He saw the borrowed funds as 'fill[ing] the hole left by the redemption'.
