  I note that the Board understood the applicant to fear being "a target of violence, kidnapping and rape, given the current situation for all women in Haiti" and made the following two findings. First, that the risks the applicant fears arise from general criminality: 
 
 
 
 "... The current Prime Minister of Haiti is a woman. According to the available documentary evidence, out of Haiti's population of 8 million, half are women.  
 The risk that the claimant believes that she is running in her situation for both herself and her children in the panel's mind relates in a much global term to the overall criminal situation in the country 
 ." (My emphasis.) 
 
 
 
 Second, that the risk is not related to her gender: 
 
 
 
 "...  
 Here, 
  however,  
 the claimant's risk is not a risk based upon her gender but rather a risk that is faced by all Haitian citizens as a result of the violence in their country 
 ." (My emphasis.)
