  For all the above reasons, I find that the Board erred in law finding that a general risk of harm precluded the applicant's claim of persecution. The Board further erred, in law and with respect to the facts, in finding that rape is not a gender-related risk in Haiti or that rape is a general risk faced by all Haitians. Finally, the Board did not consider the applicant's risk of rape due to her membership in the social group she alleged: women returning to Haiti from North America.
