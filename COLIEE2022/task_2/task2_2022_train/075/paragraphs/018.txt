 [18] 
  With regard to the second basis of the applicant's refugee claim, there is recent jurisprudence from this Court supporting a finding of a reviewable error where the Board fails to include a gender-based analysis in its assessment of the evidence of violence directed at women in Haiti (see  
 Michel et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2010] F.T.R. Uned. 159; 2010 FC 159, at paragraphs 31 to 42, and  
 Frejuste v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2009), 346 F.T.R. 177; 2009 FC 586, wherein the Court held that the Board's failure to address the 70 pages of documentary evidence demonstrating the widespread gender-based violence in Haiti constituted a reviewable error).
