The applicant and the respondent made submissions with respect to whether the judge erred when he found that the applicant did not fulfill the requirements of paragraph 5(1)(e) of the
Act
, but they failed to recognize that the judge erred in writing the applicant's mark. In his decision, he said the applicant had obtained eight correct replies to nineteen questions, which amounts to 57.8 percent, but eight correct replies out of nineteen amounts to 42.1 percent, not 57.8 percent. Moreover, in the notice to the Minister, the judge wrote that the applicant did not reply correctly to eight of the questions. [see footnote 13] Given the fact that if the applicant had correctly answered eleven questions the percentage would be 57.8 percent, it is probable that the applicant correctly answered eleven questions out of eighteen. From the formulation in the judge's decision, it is conceivable that the judge concluded that the applicant correctly answered eleven questions (the word "but" could be construed accordingly) but the whole matter is unclear owing to other considerations raised in addition to this one for which the analysis continues.
