Finally, I think that even if the judge's errors, taken individually, were not significant, they do become significant when considered cumulatively. In
Haji v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [see footnote 19] Pelletier, J., observed:
"In my view, this is to the same effect as the passages quoted from Miranda that not every error is grounds for setting aside a decision. But in this case, the errors are numerous and their cumulative effect is unknown. There comes a point at which the sheer number of errors, whether material or not, leaves one with little confidence in the soundness of the other conclusions reached by the Tribunal. It is clear that the CRDD based its decision on findings of fact made without regard to the material before it. For that reason, the decision must be set aside and the matter remitted to another panel for determination." [see footnote 20]
In the case at bar, the judge made a number of errors of fact. He found that the applicant said she was absent from Canada for 126 days when in truth she said she was absent 152 days. Furthermore, by accepting the submissions of the immigration officer, he erroneously accepted that eight trips were described in the citizenship application that were not accounted for in the passport. Finally, the judge confused the results of the replies given by the applicant to the questions about Canada. This lack of care "leaves one with little confidence in the soundness of the other conclusions reached" by the judge.
