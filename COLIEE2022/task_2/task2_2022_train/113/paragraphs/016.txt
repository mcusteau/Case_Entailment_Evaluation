  It is a foundational principle of refugee law that states are presumed to be willing and able to provide adequate protection for their citizens:  
 Canada (Attorney General) v Ward 
 , [1993] 2 SCR 689. Refugee protection is intended for exceptional circumstances, where a claimant can produce clear and convincing evidence that state protection is inadequate, on a balance of probabilities:  
 Flores Carrillo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FCA 94.
