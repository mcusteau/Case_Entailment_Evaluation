The Board, in its Decision, does not do a very good job of explaining why the Applicant's testimony was unconvincing in this respect. But a review of the tribunal record reveals the following sequence:
COUNSEL: Okay. Did you participate in any demonstrations?
CLAIMANT: Before?
COUNSEL: No, no. did you participate in any?
CLAIMANT: Yes.
COUNSEL: When?
CLAIMANT: 20th of the year of '78 which is the 11th of July of 1999 - it's one day after I was informed about demonstration by Babbak.
COUNSEL: Why did you participate?
CLAIMANT: Because I hated this regime and I wanted to see the downfall of this regime.
COUNSEL: Okay.
PRESIDING MEMBER: I'm a little confused here.
COUNSEL: (Inaudible) Chair?
PRESIDING MEMBER: I'm really confused. On one hand, you refused to even make copies and had to be forced to do that. Then on the other, you participated in these demonstrations. Please explain that.
CLAIMANT: At the beginning, yes, as I explained, when Babbak suggested it, I didn't want to. But after he talked to me, he convinced me that this is a right thing to do and the police won't behave here. And I participated in a peaceful demonstration or peaceful (inaudible). I was not planning on getting into struggle with anybody or fight with anybody. It was just a peaceful walk.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Counsel.
COUNSEL: And what did you do? So you participated on the - on July 11, 1999?
CLAIMANT: Yes.
COUNSEL: And what happened?
CLAIMANT: I joined the other students and they were yelling slogans. And all the students were asking is to know the people who were the cause of this mass killing or chain killing. And the people who attacked the dormitory, they wanted to know who they were. And they were asking (inaudible) and the Interior Minister to come out and participate. And they were just yelling against the regime and its doing and its dictatorship.
COUNSEL: Okay. And how long did you remain at the demonstration?
CLAIMANT: Approximately two hours.
COUNSEL: Okay. And why did you leave?
CLAIMANT: Because security forces and Hezbollah - they started attacking the students. They were using teargas. They were - they were shooting people. And they started attacking the demonstrators with their baton. And anybody that they could get their hands to them, they were arrested.
COUNSEL: Okay. And did Babbak remain at the demonstration?
CLAIMANT: I separated from - I don't know.
COUNSEL: Okay. And what did you do?
PRESIDING MEMBER: Did you say Babbak?
COUNSEL: Yeah.
PRESIDING MEMBER: So you don't know what happened to Babbak?
CLAIMANT: No.
COUNSEL: Okay. And what happened after that? Where did you go?
CLAIMANT: I went back to the store.
COUNSEL: Okay. And what happened?
CLAIMANT: And then the owner of the store told me that I really should take a few days off.
COUNSEL: Why?
CLAIMANT: It was chaos. I was shocked. I was frightened. And he felt under the circumstances that whatever was happened, it was better for me not to be there a few days.
COUNSEL: Okay. And where did you go?
CLAIMANT: I really didn't know anybody. And so I called my father and I got the address of one of his friends and I went there.
COUNSEL: Now - and where was your father at that time?
CLAIMANT: In the city of Neanku (ph.).
PRESIDING MEMBER: Why would you decide to go there (inaudible)? I'm not sure I understand. To go away at this point. You left - your home was supposed to be over the store.
CLAIMANT: Yes.
PRESIDING MEMBER: You wouldn't have known at this time that you'd be wanted.
CLAIMANT: I - yeah - no, I didn't know and I was not planning to do anything. But the owner told me - the owner of the store told me to stay away.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Why? Did you not ask him - why?
CLAIMANT: He told me that I see that it's getting dangerous because that store was very close to the university and the area.
PRESIDING MEMBER: All right.
MEMBER: So - the store was close to the university. And what was wrong with that?
CLAIMANT: Because he knew that I was participating in that demonstration.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Counsel, I'm sorry, but I need to clarify something else.
COUNSEL: Go ahead.
PRESIDING MEMBER: I have a few questions in this area. Why would he allow you to leave your job and go and participate on that demonstration.
CLAIMANT: I didn't tell him that I was going to go participate on that demonstration. I just - I just told him that I have to - there is something that I have to do.
PRESIDING MEMBER: But you just said, he knew you were in a demonstration.
CLAIMANT: When I went back to his store from my appearance and the (inaudible) that I had, he - I guess that he found out about it.
MEMBER: Did he ask you where have you been?
CLAIMANT: He asked me where I was and I told him.
PRESIDING MEMBER: But you just said he - you guess he found out.
CLAIMANT: At the beginning, yes.
. . . . .
COUNSEL: Okay. Now when you were on your way back to the store on July 13th, did you feel any fear? Were you still scared?
CLAIMANT: Yes.
COUNSEL: Okay. Why fear in your return to the store?
CLAIMANT: I really wanted to know had happened to Babbak.
COUNSEL: Okay.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Why would you have to go back to the store to find that out?
CLAIMANT: Because that was the store that Babbak and his friends used to go to this store to buy their books. And as I said, the owner of the bookstore was the relative of Babbak's friend.
PRESIDING MEMBER: And there was no other way to contact Babbak?
CLAIMANT: No. The only way I could have found out about Babbak was by phone - that the lines were disconnected.
