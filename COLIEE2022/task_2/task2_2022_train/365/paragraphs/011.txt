The Respondent submits that the Board found the Applicant's evidence on this point implausible not only because he testified that he and his cousin were not together during the demonstration and that the two of them went to the demonstration separately, but also because the Applicant was advised by the Toraj bookstore owner to leave the area for his own safety immediately after the demonstration and again some three days later. Furthermore, the Respondent notes that the Applicant stated that he was aware that being in the vicinity of the university was dangerous because security forces were in the process of investigating the circumstances surrounding the demonstration and arresting people thought to have participated. The Respondent submits, therefore, in light of what the Applicant claimed to have known about what the security forces were doing in the area, and based on what he claimed to have done during the demonstration (i.e. active participation and the printing of flyers), and based upon the fact that he knew that his cousin would have been fearful of the security forces as well, the Board was reasonable in finding it implausible that the Applicant would have returned to the Toraj bookstore after the demonstration.
