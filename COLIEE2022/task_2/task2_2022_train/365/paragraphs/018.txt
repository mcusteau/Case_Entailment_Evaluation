Counsel for the Respondent urges me to recognize that there were inconsistencies and significant omissions in the Applicant's testimony that lay behind the Board's somewhat tentative conclusions to the effect that "the panel finds it implausible ..." or "the panel finds the explanation unsatisfactory ..." or "the panel finds it puzzling ... ." It is trite law that the Refugee Division is entitled to decide adversely with respect to a claimant's credibility on the basis of contradictions and inconsistencies in the claimant's story. Moreover, the Refugee Division is entitled to make adverse findings regarding credibility on the basis of the implausibility of the claimant's testimony alone.
