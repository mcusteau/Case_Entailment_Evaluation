In Aguebor v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1993] F.C.J. No. 732 the Federal Court of Appeal discussed the standard of review for Refugee Division decisions at paragraph 4 of its decision:
There is no longer any doubt that the Refugee Division, which is a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: Who is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences? As long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review.
