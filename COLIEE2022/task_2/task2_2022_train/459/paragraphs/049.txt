As to the absence of reliable evidence that the LTTE was extorting large amounts of money in Colombo at the time alleged, nor that elderly Tamils were mistreated, the evidence is at best ambiguous. The U.S. Department of State Report mentions that the LTTE was responsible for extortion without confining this finding to a specific geographical zone. The Research Directorate of the Immigration and Refugee Board also reported in 2003 that, "as a consequence of the ceasefire and the resulting ability of the LTTE to now move freely in government controlled areas, the LTTE has reportedly been able to extend its extortion activity into new territory, particularly the towns of Batticaloa and Karaitivu".
