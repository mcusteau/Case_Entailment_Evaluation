The applicant says that the Board narrowed the test too much, when it found that there was no evidence of elderly Tamils being extorted in Colombo. The applicant notes that the Board did not say that (a) there was no extortion by the LTTE, or (b) there was no extortion in Colombo. The applicant says that the qualifiers used (elderly Tamils) narrow the test too much, and the Board erred by being microscopic. In addition, the applicant submits that documentary evidence, in the form of the U.S. Department of State (DOS) report on Sri Lanka, corroborates the extortion and kidnapping for ransom by the LTTE, and also shows that the LTTE is now free to operate in government controlled territories.
