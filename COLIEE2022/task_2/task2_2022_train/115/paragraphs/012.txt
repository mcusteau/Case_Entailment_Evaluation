 [12] 
  It is the condition that the plaintiff only fish under either the offshore or inshore licence but not both at the same time, that gives rise to this action. The plaintiff says that the decision by the Minister requiring him to elect constitutes a patently unreasonable exercise of discretion. Alternatively, he says the Minister negligently represented, through his press releases and actions in 1992, 1993 and 1994, that the plaintiff could utilize both licences at the same time and the plaintiff relied on such misrepresentations to his detriment.
