 Rothstein, J. (ex officio) 
 : This is an action for damages arising from a decision of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans requiring Oswan Tucker (the plaintiff) to elect either to utilize an inshore fishing licence for groundfish or an offshore fishing licence for turbot. The plaintiff says that the Minister exercised his discretion under section 7 of the  
 Fisheries Act 
  in a patently unreasonable manner. Alternatively, he says the Minister made a negligent misrepresentation upon which the plaintiff relied to his detriment.
