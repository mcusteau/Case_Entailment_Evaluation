  On June 15, 1990, the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans issued a press release setting out details of a developmental program designed to encourage the development and exploration of under-utilized groundfish stocks in Atlantic Canada. The program specified that under-utilized species of groundfish included Greenland halibut (turbot) in fishing subarea O and divisions 2GH and 2J3KL, areas quite far north (e.g., subarea O is between Baffin Island and Greenland). Fishing quotas in these areas were not being fully met and the fish there were thought to be larger and more plentiful than in areas further south.
