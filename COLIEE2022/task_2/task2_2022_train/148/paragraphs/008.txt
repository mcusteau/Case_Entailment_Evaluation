  With regards to the filling of a request, the guidelines set forth that taxpayers should provide all relevant information to support their request including any relevant documentation. In cases involving financial hardship (inability to pay), a meaningful payment arrangement which covers at least the tax and the penalty part, if applicable, and full financial disclosure including a statement of income and expenses, as well as a statement of assets and liabilities should be provided. (Information Circular IC07-I,  
 Taxpayer Relief Provisions 
 , May 31, 2007, paragraph 32 (g)). Finally, as to third-party actions, taxpayers are generally considered to be responsible for errors made by third parties acting on their behalf for income tax matters. However, there may be exceptional situations, where it may be appropriate to provide relief to taxpayers because of third-party errors or delays. (Information Circular IC07-I,  
 Taxpayer Relief Provisions 
 , May 31, 2007, paragraph 35).
