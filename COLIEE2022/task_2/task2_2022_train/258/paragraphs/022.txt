To know how to acquire the kind of special knowledge needed to properly judge a case involving domestic violence, Wilson, J., in
Lavallee
at p. 873 [S.C.R.] gives the following guidance to decision makers:
"Expert testimony on the psychological effects of battering have been admitted in American courts in recent years. In
State v. Kelly
, 478 A.2d 364 (1984), at p. 378, the New Jersey Supreme Court commended the value of expert testimony in these terms:
'It is aimed at an area where the purported common knowledge of the jury may be very much mistaken, an area where jurors' logic, drawn from their own experience, may lead to a wholly incorrect conclusion, an area where expert knowledge would enable the jurors to disregard their prior conclusions as being common myths rather than common knowledge.'
"The court concludes at p. 379 that the battering relationship is 'subject to a large group of myths and stereotypes'. As such, it is 'beyond the ken of the average juror and thus is suitable for explanation through expert testimony'. I share that view."
