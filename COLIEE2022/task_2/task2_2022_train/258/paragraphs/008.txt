As it turns out, in its reasons for decision, the CRDD certainly impugned the applicant's credibility. This is most evident from the following opening passages from the decision:
"[The applicant's] testimony was not clear and consistent; in spite of various amendments to her narrative, the sequence of the events and their dates remained uncertain. To explain why she had provided different versions of the narrative in her Personal Information Form (PIF), she said that she had been trying to recall her story and that new details came to her memory as time went by.
"The panel is of the opinion that she tried to embellish her story. She completed the first version of her story with the assistance of counsel. In spite of that, one of the main incidents, that she was allegedly attacked with a machete by her husband while she was at her church, was not mentioned in her PIF. The panel does not find it credible that the claimant could forget about such an incident, considering that she continues to have a scar allegedly caused by the attack and that she had consulted a doctor in Canada with regard to the scars she has on her body.
The main credibility concern in the panel's mind is the delay in removing herself from the place where she allegedly was exposed to persecution and later the delay in claiming refugee status in Canada
