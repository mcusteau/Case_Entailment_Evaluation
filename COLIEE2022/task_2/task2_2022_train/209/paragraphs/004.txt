  On or about March 20, 2006, the applicant filed a complaint with the Commission alleging discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin and colour, contrary to the Act, in respect of alleged acts that occurred between the summer of 2004 and March of 2006 (the complaint). In the complaint, the applicant summarized the following allegations against his immediate supervisors at Canada Post: 
 
 
 
 - he was denied leave on September 13, 2004 to visit his mother who was very ill;

 - he was wrongly accused of creating overtime on his route on April 11, 2005 and was subsequently disciplined (the complaint also alleged that Canada Post's policy and practice of scrutinizing and monitoring overtime was applied more severely to letter carriers who were members of visible minorities); 
 
 
 
 - his sort table was moved away from his fellow employees on or about March 2005; 
 
 
 
 - eight hours pay was deducted in April of 2005 without notice; 
 
 
 
 - his supervisor had discussions about him with a co-worker and a union representative in his absence; 
 
 
 
 - he was wrongly accused of leaving 99 pieces of mail behind in August of 2005. 
 
 
 
 - he was treated differently than other employees in the conduct of an investigation into a complaint of harassment against him by another employee in October of 2005; 
 
 
 
 - he was treated differently insofar as his start time of his route was changed and when additional points of call were added on or about April 2005.
