  The Commission acts as an administrative and screening body, deciding whether a complaint should be referred to the tribunal under sections 44 and 49 of the Act. The Commission does not decide a complaint on its merits at this stage, but determines whether having regard to all the circumstances, it is satisfied that an inquiry into the complaint is warranted. As such, its decisions are administrative in nature and therefore discretionary (see
