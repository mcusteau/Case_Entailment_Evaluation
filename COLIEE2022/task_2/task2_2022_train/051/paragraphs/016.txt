  In  
 Turner 
 , cited above, the Federal Court of Appeal determined that the taxpayer was entitled to an ABIL and to claim the loss in question in 1994, and not 1984, because it was not, on the facts before the Court, open to conclude that as of 1984 the company in question would be dissolved and would never carry on business in the future. In so concluding, the Court found it to be an error to look only to when the corporation ceased to do business, because it must also be shown that it was reasonable to expect the corporation to be dissolved and not carry on business in the future. The Court looked to the fact that the corporation in question obtained the return of its commercial air service license in 1985 after appealing the cancellation of the license, and that a lawsuit brought by the taxpayer and the corporation relating to the alleged wrongful revocation of the license was not settled until 1994.
