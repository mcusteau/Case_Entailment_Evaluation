 Dawson, J. 
 : On October 22, 2001 Mr. Simmonds, the applicant, submitted what is known as a "fairness request" under paragraph 152(4.2)(c) of the  
 Income Tax Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) (" 
 Act 
 "). That request sought reassessment of Mr. Simmonds' 1993 taxation year so as to permit him to claim an allowable business investment loss ("ABIL") in the amount of $323,333 in respect of shares Mr. Simmonds owned on December 31, 1993 in Perfection Group Limited ("PGL"). Mr. Simmonds' initial request was denied, as was a subsequent second-level request. Mr. Simmonds now brings this application for judicial review of the negative second-level decision. For the reasons that follow, I have determined that the application should be allowed.
