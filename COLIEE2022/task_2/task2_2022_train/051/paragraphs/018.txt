  In  
 St-Onge 
 , also cited above, the Tax Court of Canada set forth certain principles that govern the proper application of the predecessor to subparagraph 50(1)(b)(iii). Judge Archambault found that: 
 
 
 
 1. The relevant date for determining the reasonableness of the likelihood of dissolution or wind up is at the end of the taxation year in question. In my view, this interpretation is consistent with the ordinary and grammatical sense of the words used in the legislation. 
 
 
 
 2. No time limit is set for the corporation to be dissolved or wound up. It is sufficient for it to have been reasonable to expect the corporation in question to be dissolved or wound up at some point. This, in my opinion, is consistent with that portion of paragraph 50(1)(b) of the  
 Act 
  which deems the taxpayer to have disposed of a share at the end of the year for proceeds equal to nil and to have reacquired it immediately thereafter at a cost equal to nil. This appears to contemplate the possibility that the corporation may not be formally dissolved, and events may transpire (for example, the successful conclusion of a lawsuit) to cause the shares to acquire value. In that case a capital gain would result on their disposition. 
 
 
 
 3. What in any case is "reasonable" to expect is not based upon the subjective view of a party. Rather, what must be considered is the view of an objective observer with knowledge of all of the pertinent facts.
