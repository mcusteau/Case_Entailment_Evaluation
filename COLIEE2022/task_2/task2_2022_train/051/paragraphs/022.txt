  I respectfully disagree. The Director's decision was lengthy and considered. The initial decision had been based, in part, upon the refusal to allow an extension of time for the filing of the election. Subsequently, submissions were made on that issue and the second-level decision was express that the fairness request was denied only because the requirement of clause 50(1)(b)(iii)(A) was not met. I do not accept that the Director was oblivious to one of the two grounds upon which the application had been previously decided. I observe the transparency in decision-making is not promoted by allowing decision-makers to supplement their reasons after the fact in affidavits.
