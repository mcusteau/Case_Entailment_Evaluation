  Specifically, in the context of the procedural rights afforded to a self represented party, this Court has held that an administrative tribunal has no obligation to act as the attorney for a claimant who refused counsel, and that: 
 
 
 
 [...] it is not the obligation of the Board to "teach" the Applicant the law on a particular matter involving his or her claim. ( 
 Ngyuen v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] FC 1001, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1244 (QL), at para. 17)
