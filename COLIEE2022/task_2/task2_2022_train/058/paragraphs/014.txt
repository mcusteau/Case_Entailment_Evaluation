  In determining the content of participatory rights, L'Heureux-Dub√© J. noted in  
 Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 (QL), at para. 21, that "the concept of procedural fairness is eminently variable and its content is to be decided in the specific context of each case." She went on to indicate at para. 22 "[...] that the purpose of the participatory rights contained within the duty of procedural fairness is to [provide] an opportunity for those affected by the decision to put forward their views and evidence fully and have them considered by the decision-maker."
