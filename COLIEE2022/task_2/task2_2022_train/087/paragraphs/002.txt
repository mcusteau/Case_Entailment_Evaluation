  The issue on the appeal was whether Ms. Saraffian satisfied the residence requirements necessary to qualify for a full pension; specifically whether she was residing in Canada prior to July 1, 1977. On October 12, 2010 the Tribunal determined that Ms. Saraffian had failed to discharge her burden of proof. In this application, Ms. Saraffian seeks judicial review of that decision. The matter has been unduly delayed as Ms. Saraffian represented herself and requested several extensions of time to complete the preliminary steps.
