  There are questionable aspects to the Tribunal's fact-finding. It interpreted the applicant's travel back-and-forth between New York and Montréal as residence in New York and visits to Montréal rather than the reverse. It could have found the contrary from the evidence of the passport stamps in July 1977. Nor does it necessarily follow that the applicant's then boyfriend would have added her name to his apartment lease had they been living together for a year prior to marriage. And it seems plausible that the applicant could have remained uncertain about the marriage in July 1977, eight months prior to its celebration in Montréal in February 1978. Moreover, it is not unlikely that the applicant would have submitted her immigration application from New York rather than Montréal as she was an American citizen at that date.
