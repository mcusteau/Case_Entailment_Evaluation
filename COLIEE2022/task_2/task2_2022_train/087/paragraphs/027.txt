  In closing, I wish to note that at several times during the hearing of this application Ms. Saraffian stated that she has the necessary documentary evidence in her possession to prove her claim. If that is the case, and she is still able to produce it, I would suggest that the respondent consider whether there is any basis upon which the application might be reopened on compassionate grounds considering Ms. Saraffian's age and limited income.
