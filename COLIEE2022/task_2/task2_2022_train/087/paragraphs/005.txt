  Ms. Saraffian turned 65 in May 2007 and applied for a Canadian pension. She says that when she was completing the application she telephoned for assistance and was advised by an official to put down the date she had been granted a permanent resident visa, which was April 10, 1978, as the date on which she had established residence in Canada.
