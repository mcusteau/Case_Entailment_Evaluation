  At the hearing of the appeal and in her affidavits before the Tribunal and the Court, Ms. Saraffian explained that she had met her future husband in 1975. They exchanged visits thereafter in New York and Montréal and after a year he asked her to leave her job in the U.S. to join him in Canada. She said she resigned from her position in New York in April 1976 and moved into his apartment in Montréal as a trial arrangement while considering marriage. She went to New York on a monthly basis to see her mother. In some months her mother would come to see her in Montréal. She left her furniture in a commercial warehouse in New York and opened a bank account in Montréal. In early 1977, she says, she deposited a large sum of money in a bank near her future husband's apartment.
