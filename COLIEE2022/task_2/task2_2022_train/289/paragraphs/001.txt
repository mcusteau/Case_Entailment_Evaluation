Rothstein, J.
: In this stay application, the applicant alleges that the Minister has a duty to consider her humanitarian and compassionate application before removing her. The Minister does not dispute that a humanitarian and compassionate application was filed on November 28th, 1995, and that it has not yet been dealt with. I would observe, however, that the applicant was arrested on November 16, 1995, pursuant to an Immigration warrant that had been outstanding for some two and one-half years. The humanitarian and compassionate application was made thereafter, after the Minister located the applicant and detained her for the purpose of removal.
