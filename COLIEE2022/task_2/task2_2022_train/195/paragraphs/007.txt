  The standard of judicial review dictated by the pragmatic and functional approach set down by the Supreme Court is not in issue. Matters of natural justice are not touched by that approach. The Court owes the officer no deference. Another way of putting it is that the standard of review is correctness (C.U.P.E. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour), [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539 and Canada (Attorney General) v. Sketchley, 2005 FCA 404).
