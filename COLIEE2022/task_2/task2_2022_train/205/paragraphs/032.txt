  In my opinion, special circumstances warrant an order of costs in favour of the Applicant with respect to the present Application, quite apart from the fair agreement reached that the RPD's decision is rendered in error of fact. I find that the special circumstance that exists for making a costs order is the challenging obligation on Counsel for the Applicant to deal with the RPD's failure to critically analyse how to properly apply the decisions in  
 Villafranca 
  and  
 Kadenko 
 . In my opinion, fixed costs of $5,000 are warranted.
