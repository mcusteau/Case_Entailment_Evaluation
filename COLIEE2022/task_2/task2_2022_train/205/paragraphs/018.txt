  In my opinion,  
 Ward 
  amends the decision in  
 Villafranca 
  in a particularly important respect.  
 Ward 
  makes a clear statement on the quantity and quality of the evidence which a claimant must produce to rebut the presumption of state protection; that is, a claimant is only required to provide  
 some clear and convincing evidence 
 . Therefore, in my opinion, the statement in  
 Villafranca 
  that "it is not enough for a claimant merely to show that his government has not always been effective at protecting persons in his particular situation" cannot any longer be applied as a point of law. Thus, evidence of the failure of state authorities to  
 effectively 
  respond to requests from women for protection from violent sexual predators, exclusive of all other evidence, can be found to constitute some clear and convincing evidence that rebuts the presumption of state protection. Whether this finding is made depends on the quality of the evidence produced in the judgment of the decision-maker involved.
