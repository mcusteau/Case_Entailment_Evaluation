  Counsel for the Applicant argues that, given the uncontested facts found by the RPD in the decision presently under review, for the re-determination, I should direct the RPD to find that the Applicant is a person in need of protection. I find that the nature of the errors in the RPD's decision make it inappropriate to do so. However, I do agree that this is an appropriate case for directions to be given.
