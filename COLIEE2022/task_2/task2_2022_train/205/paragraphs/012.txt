 [12] 
  The second component comprises two statements (ie. [3] and [4] ) pertaining to state protection in a claim dealing with fear of terrorism, and must be read in this light. Terrorism, by its very nature, is a direct threat to a state's authority. Therefore, it is fair to assume that a state will act to preserve itself, and its failure to meet all terrorist attempts to arrest its lawful authority cannot be accepted as lack of acceptance of responsibility to do so, or lack of ability to do so. It is within the context of a claim based on fear of terrorism that the words in statement [3] have meaning. The use of the word "normally" is an acknowledgement that state collapse is not needed in every case of fear of terrorism to prove state inability; again, the context drives the result.
