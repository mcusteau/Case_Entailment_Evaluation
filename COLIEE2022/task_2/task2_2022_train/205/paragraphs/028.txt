  In my opinion, the following statement of the RPD in the decision under review does not show a working understanding of the law on state protection: 
 
 
 
 "The claimant provided no evidence that the government of Brazil is in disarray and unable to govern and as perfect protection ( 
 Zalzali v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1991] 3 F.C. 605 (F.C.A.) and protection for all citizens at all times ( 
 Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Villafranca 
  (1992), 18 Imm. L.R.(2d) 130), is not the criteria for adequate protection." 
 
 
 
 In particular, it appears from the statement that the Applicant was required to prove that the government of Brazil is in a condition of collapse in order to rebut the presumption of state protection which, as above described, is an error in law. In addition, the decision, considered as a whole, contains no meaningful contextual application of the law on state protection, which, as above described, is also an error in law. For these reasons, I find that the RPD's decision is patently unreasonable.
