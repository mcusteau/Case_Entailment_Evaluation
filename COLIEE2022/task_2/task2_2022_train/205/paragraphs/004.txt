  In its decision of September 1, 2005, prior to making findings on state protection upon which the decision turns, the RPD states the Applicant's evidence of the violence she has suffered and her attempts to access state protection in Brazil. Since no negative credibility finding is made, I find that the RPD accepted the Applicant's evidence as true, and, subject to correction on two points, the statement constitutes facts upon which the claim for protection should be decided.
