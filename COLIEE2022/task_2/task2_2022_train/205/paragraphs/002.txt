  Prior to the hearing of the present Application, the Respondent agreed that the RPD's decision was rendered in reviewable error because two important factual findings in the RPD's decision are not supported by the evidence on the record, and, as a result, without the Application going to hearing, requested the Applicant to consent to her claim being sent back for re-determination. Counsel for the Applicant refused to consent on the argument that the RPD erred in its determination on the issue for state protection, and that this determination must be scrutinized so that, on the inevitable re-determination, state protection can be properly determined. I agree with this argument. Therefore, given the admitted reviewable error, this matter will be sent back for re-determination, but on directions.
