 [7] 
  It is clear on the facts that the respondent's brother, Vaneet's natural father, consented but did not physically give Vaneet in adoption, as required on a literal reading of s. 9(2) of  
 HAMA 
 . Section 9(2) provides as follows: 
 
 
 
 "9(2) Subject to the provisions of ... the father, if alive, shall alone have the right to give in adoption, but such right shall not be exercised save with the consent of the mother ..." 
 
 
 
 In this instance, in the presence of and with the consent of both the respondent and his brother, Vaneet's natural father, Vaneet's natural mother physically gave Vaneet to the respondent's wife.
