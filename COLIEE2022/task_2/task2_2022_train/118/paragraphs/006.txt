  Adoption is a question of status and as a general rule is determined by the law of the place where the adoption has taken place:  
 Singh (Ajaib) and Brar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1990), 116 N.R. 176; 11 Imm. L.R.(2d) 1 (F.C.A.), at p. 4. However, unlike the  
 Singh 
  case, the issue of whether a legal adoption has occurred is very much at issue in this case.
