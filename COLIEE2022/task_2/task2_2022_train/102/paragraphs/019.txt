  I find it hard, however, to reach this conclusion in light of the Board's negative credibility findings. Surely if the Board found the Applicant to be not credible regarding his alleged links with Sikh militants, and the Applicant then chooses not question this part of the decision, he cannot now allege that, because he has been in Canada, India will believe these links do indeed exist. The Applicant has provided documentary evidence in support of his argument that where a person is suspected to have links to an overseas terrorist organization, he or she may have trouble upon their return to India, however, this is evidence of general risk (See "Control on arrival", Danish Report, Section 9.4). The Applicant must show personalized risk, and, in the absence of arguments against the Board's credibility findings, he has not shown such a risk.
