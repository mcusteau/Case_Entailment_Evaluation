On October 8, 2005, Kashmir, and in particular the POK, was hit by an earthquake that had devastating effects on the area. An estimated 100,000 people were killed, 100,000 were wounded and 3.2 million became homeless. Houses, property and businesses were destroyed and there was no electricity, water, shelter, medical aid, or food. The government stole much of the relief aid, so that thousands of people died because of the lack of medical care, food and shelter. Corrupt army generals, politicians, and the Speaker of the Assembly appropriated most of the foreign aid. The rest was distributed to those who were loyal to the government.
