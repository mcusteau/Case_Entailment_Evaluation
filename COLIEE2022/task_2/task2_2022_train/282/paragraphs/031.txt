Fifthly, the RPD made a negative credibility finding based on the Applicant's delay in submitting a First Information Report (FIR), a Warrant of Arrest, and an August 7, 2007 letter from a lawyer in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. The FIR was issued by the Thorar police and accuses the Applicant of publicly criticizing the government of Azad Kashmir, the government of Pakistan and the Pakistan army for their handling of the earthquake relief at a UKPNP procession on April 25, 2006. The FIR was not received by the RPD until September 12, 2007, more than one year after the Applicant completed his PIF on July 10, 2006. The Applicant was represented by counsel at the time he completed his PIF. The RPD found that a copy of a FIR is not difficult to obtain from Pakistan because, according to Section 265-C of the Criminal Procedure Code of Pakistan, copies of a FIR, and other documents, "shall be supplied free of cost to the accused not later than seven days before the commencement of the trial." According to the documentary evidence, the RPD found that, as well as the accused, even members of the public could obtain a FIR. The letter from the lawyer, which was also not received by the Board until more than one year after the PIF was made, stated that the lawyer had already obtained copies of the FIR and the Warrant of Arrest as of February 8, 2007. The FIR and the Warrant of Arrest were evidence of central importance to the Applicant's claim, so the RPD drew a negative inference based on the Applicant's waiting a year to produce them, stating that "I find the claimant's substantial delay in obtaining the FIR and Warrant of Arrest allegedly registered against him significantly undermines the authenticity and reliability of these documents."
