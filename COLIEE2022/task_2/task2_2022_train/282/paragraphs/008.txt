In January 1998, Sardar Shoukat Ali Kashmiri was kidnapped again by the ISI. The UKPNP protested and the state retaliated by making false criminal accusations against party members. Some members were jailed, others went underground, and the rest left the country and sought refugee protection abroad. At this time, the Applicant suggested that the party hire the best lawyer in Pakistan and seek the assistance of international organizations to pressure the government to release the party Chairman. However, the Chairman was once again tortured, warned, and then released. The Chairman did not heed the warning and, instead, went to Kashmir where he painted a defamatory picture of the ISI. As a result, in 1999, the party believed the Chairman was at risk of being rearrested and killed, so they advised him to leave the country. He fled to Switzerland and was granted refugee status.
