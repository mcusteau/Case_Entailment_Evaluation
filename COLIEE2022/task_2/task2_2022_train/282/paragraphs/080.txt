This documentation is highly supportive of the Applicant's account of what people in his position are likely to suffer in Pakistan and POK, yet the RPD does not refer to it or explain why it has no relevance. The RPD confines itself to specific UKPNP research but does not explain why the Applicant would not face the same persecution as others who, Human Rights Watch tells us, are mistreated by authorities who routinely use torture in a context where tight controls and the suspension of human rights and democratic freedoms are a regular aspect of state control. The Applicant specifically drew the RPD's attention to similarly situated persons who had been subjected to torture and who have sought refugee protection in Canada. None of this is referred to by the RPD in its reasons. This was evidence that directly contradicted the RPD's conclusions and it should have been referred to and addressed. See
