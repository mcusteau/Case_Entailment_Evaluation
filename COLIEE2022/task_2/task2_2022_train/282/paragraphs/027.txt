The RPD found that the Applicant was not a credible witness for several reasons. First, the Member did not accept that the Applicant would have waited until April 2006 to flee from Pakistan if he had been arrested and detained on December 20, 2005 and on January 8, 2006. The Applicant's explanation was that, although he was arrested on these occasions, there were no police cases or charges against him as a result; therefore, he only decided to flee upon learning that the police had registered a case against him in April, 2006. The RPD did not accept the Applicant's explanation on the basis that his allegations of police abuse were "all allegations of a very serious nature," so that he would not have waited to leave Pakistan when he had the opportunity to leave earlier.
