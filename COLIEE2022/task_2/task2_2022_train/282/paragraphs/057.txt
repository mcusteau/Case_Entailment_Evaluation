The RPD considered the Applicant's testimony that the situation was not bad enough to leave Pakistan earlier but did not believe him. The RPD had the right to weigh the Applicant's evidence that he had been illegally detained and tortured by the police and to decide that, if these allegations were true, then he would have felt compelled to leave sooner.
