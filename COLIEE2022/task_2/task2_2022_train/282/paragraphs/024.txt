The RPD made a negative credibility finding on the issue of whether the Applicant has a fear of being subjected to serious harm or death if he is returned to Pakistan:
If he were to return to Pakistan, the claimant fears that he will be subjected to serious harm or killed by the Pakistan police, the Pakistan Inter-Services Agency as well as the current governments of POK, also known Azad Kashmir, and Pakistan. At the hearing, the claimant testified that he also feared persecution at the hands of members of extremist or terrorist groups often referred to as
jihadi
or Islamist militant groups operating in POK and elsewhere in Pakistan. However, the claimant does not state that he experienced any problems with these jihadi or Islamist militant groups in POK or Azad Kashmir in his PIF narrative - no did he testify to this effect at this effect [sic].
