It is clear from paragraph 18 of the Decision that the RPD places a great deal of emphasis on the documentary evidence concerning the ECL system for its finding in paragraph 19 of the Decision on implausibility. The Respondent concedes that the Applicant was not questioned about the ECL system at the hearing but says that the onus was upon him to explain how he was able to leave Pakistan on his own passport notwithstanding the existence of the ECL system. The Applicant says that, had he known that the RPD was concerned about the ECL system, he would have been able to lead evidence concerning its application which would have shown why he was not caught by that system. However, he was never asked about it and could not reasonably have anticipated that it would be a concern.
