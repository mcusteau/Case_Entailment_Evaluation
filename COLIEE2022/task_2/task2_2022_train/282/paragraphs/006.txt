The Applicant became a member of UKPNP after its formation in 1994. He says his assistance to the party was initially limited. The party came under increasing state scrutiny and, in 1995, the party Chairman, Sardar Shoukat Ali Kashmiri, was detained, tortured, and warned to stop promoting the independence of Kashmir. The party became more active and held public demonstrations in POK. The Applicant says that he became very distressed at this point because the state was repressing freedom of speech.
