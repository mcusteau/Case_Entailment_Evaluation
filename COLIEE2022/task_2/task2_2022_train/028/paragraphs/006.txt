  The Applicant departed Canada only 37 days after her arrival and was absent for 1,092 days. Thereafter, she was absent for 25 day and 586 day periods. She could not provide evidence to confirm that her husband lived in Canada or that her son attended school in the relevant period. In addition, she could not confirm her residential addresses in the country. Although the Applicant claimed she was in Canada for 1,204 days, the Citizenship Judge was unable to determine the extent of her physical absences due to a lack of documentation.
