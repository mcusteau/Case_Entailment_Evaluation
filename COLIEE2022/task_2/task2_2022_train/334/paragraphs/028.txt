According to
Immigration Manual
procedures, the medical officers assessing the Glendale report had to consider each s. 22 factor and to indicate what Qi's new medical profile was under the M5 overall assessment. There was thus no evidence before the Immigration Officer to support the view that Qi would place "excessive demands" on health or social services, as required for a finding of inadmissibility under s. 19(1)(a)(ii). In addition it was, still according to counsel, not only unfair but unreasonable for the Immigration Officer to have, in effect, downgraded Qi from M5 to M7.
