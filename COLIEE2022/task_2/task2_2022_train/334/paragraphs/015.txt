In December 1991, Gao received a "fill-in-the blanks" form letter from the Canada Immigration Centre signed "S. Reid for Manager", informing him as follows:
"Although it has been found that your case has sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for processing your application in Canada, you have been found to be inadmissible to Canada pursuant to s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
, in that you:
have a dependant [sic] son, Qi Hui Gao, who suffer [sic] a disability which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer, would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health and social services.
"Therefore, your application for permanent residence in Canada has been denied." (underlining designates handwritten fill-in)
