The Immigration Officer's decision gave no indication as to the grounds for its conclusion. HW's purported M5 assessment of December 1990 was inconsistent with the assessments of M7 and T5 included in the 1988 Medical Notification. The M5 assessment states that future admission to Canada could be considered because of the "expected response to treatment". On the other hand, the T5 and M7 assessments imply that no treatment was available or likely to succeed and that the finding of inadmissibility was final. Thus, the effect of the Immigration Officer's decision was to downgrade Qi from M5 to M7 without justification or explanation.
