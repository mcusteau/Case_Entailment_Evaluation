Qi was examined by Dr. G. Chew ("Dr. Chew"). Dr. Chew's ensuing report to HW made no mention of mental retardation, and indicated Qi's prognosis was "good". In May 1990, HW in Ottawa communicated with Dr. Chew requesting extensive specific additional information with respect to Qi's mental development. Dr. Chew referred Qi to the Glendale Lodge Society, where an intensive assessment was carried out in August 1990, including medical, psychological, hearing and speech profiles. The ensuing exhaustive report ("the Glendale report") was forwarded to HW in September 1990. Gao also received a copy, which he interpreted as a positive accounting of Qi's developmental progress and future prognosis.
