As Gao's Supplementary Affidavit points out, Dr. Ferrari's claim that Qi had been assessed
M5
is inaccurate, as the January 1988 Medical Notification had assessed Qi as
M7
. The file contains no documentary evidence of any communication between HW and immigration in November 1991 informing the latter of the HW assessment of the Glendale report. There is no evidence that the Immigration Officer received or reviewed the Glendale report.
