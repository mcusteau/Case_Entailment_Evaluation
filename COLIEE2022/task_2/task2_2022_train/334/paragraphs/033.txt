The governing principle arising from this body of jurisprudence is that reviewing or appellate courts are not competent to make findings of fact related to the medical diagnosis, but are competent to review the evidence to determine whether the medical officers' opinion is reasonable in the circumstances of the case (
Minister of Employment and Immigration v. Jiwanpuri
(1990), 109 N.R. 293 (F.C.A.);
Deol v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 145 N.R. 156 (F.C.A.)). The reasonableness of a medical opinion is to be assessed not only as of the time it was given, but also as of the time it was relied upon by the Immigration Officer, since it is that decision which is being reviewed or appealed (
