Naturally, counsel for the Minister did not accept these two arguments. With respect to procedural fairness, she claimed the process leading to the December 1991 decision was fair: the 1988 opinion was reasonable in light of the available material and the 1990 Glendale report confirmed the 1988 diagnosis.

He could have made representations had he wished to.
