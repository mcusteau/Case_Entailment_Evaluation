  The respondent submits that on the evidence before her it was reasonably open to the PRRA Officer to determine that adequate state protection is available to the applicant and that the applicant had not exhausted all avenues of recourse before leaving Hungary. The PRRA Officer did not expect the applicant to directly approach the state or even the police. Her concern was that he presented no evidence that he had approached any other agency. The respondent submits that the applicant is unable to rebut the presumption with clear and convincing proof that state protection would be forthcoming to him should he seek it.
