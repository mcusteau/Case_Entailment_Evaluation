 Did the PRRA officer err in law by ignoring, or failing to properly assess the evidence? 
 
 
 
 "The PPRA Officer stated in her reasons: 
 
 
 
 'The Pre-Removal Risk Assessment is a forward-looking process that is personal to the applicant. As it looks toward the future, current reliable and objective evidence (i.e. U.S. Department of State Report - 2002, Amnesty International Report - 2002, Human Rights Watch 2003 etc) will be fully assessed to determine if the applicant would be at risk if he were to return to Hungary for reasons of his ethnicity, being a Roma.'"
