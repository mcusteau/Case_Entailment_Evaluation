Section 1 of Part VIII of the
Customs Election Regulations
deals with election appeals. It provides, in part, that any candidate or elector "... may lodge an appeal by forwarding it in writing by mail to the Appeal Board at the Lower Similkameen Indian Administration, Box 100, Keremeos, B.C., V0X 1N0". On the one hand it is the plaintiffs' position that no appeal was ever filed, but on the other hand the defendants say that an appeal was taken to the desk at the Band Office and stamped.
