Additionally, the moving party in
Consorzio
was seeking increased costs on a lump sum basis. Mr. Justice Rothstein determined that rule 403 does not preclude "directing the assessment officer to assess increased costs on the basis of a lump sum". That is not what is being sought here. Astra and Takeda are requesting that I depart from my choice of column under the Tariff. Such a request is entirely different from that made in
Consorzio
. While Mr. Justice DÃ©cary (dissenting in part) had doubts about allowing a variation to provide for a lump sum, he was willing to consider it ( paras. 25-26). The court has, in the past, expressed a preference for awarding lump sum costs. In
Barzelex v. M.V. Ebn Al Waleed et al.
, [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 930; [1999] F.C.J. No. 2002 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Hugessen noted:
"In my view, as a matter of policy the court should favour lump sum orders. It saves time and trouble for the parties and it is a more efficient method for them to know what their liability is for costs."
