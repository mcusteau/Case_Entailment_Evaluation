The costs in the impugned order provide direction to the assessment officer because costs are awarded on the ordinary scale. Astra and Takeda do not suggest that the ordinary scale can be taken to mean anything other than column III. Thus, a motion for directions to assess under a different column is, in substance, nothing other than a motion for a variation of the judgment; it is not a request for directions. I refer to the comments of Mr. Justice Strayer in
Minister of National Revenue v. Canadian Pacific Ltd.
(2002), 289 N.R. 159 (F.C.A.), at paras. 1 and 2 wherein he stated:
"[...] In our judgment we dismissed the appeal 'with costs'.
"The respondent now appears to want the court to reconsider its judgment of December 21, 2001. The motion purports to be brought under rule 403 for 'directions' that the costs awarded are to include costs in other courts and in other proceedings. But what is now being sought is an award of costs which was not made by the court in its judgment. That is not permitted under rule 403."
