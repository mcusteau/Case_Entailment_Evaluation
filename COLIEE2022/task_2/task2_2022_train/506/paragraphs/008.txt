I do not disagree that
Consorzio
permits an amendment or variation of a judgment. However, in the context in which the comment was made, Mr. Justice Rothstein was referring to circumstances where the judgment did not include an order for costs. Justice Rothstein also stated that rule 403 is available in circumstances where the court has awarded "costs" without specification. In
Consorzio
, the court was ruling on a motion regarding an order for "costs". The word "costs", without more, lacks specificity. Absent indication to the contrary, under rules 407 and 400(5), this means costs according to column III of the table to Tariff B. In my view,
Consorzio
stands for the proposition that where there is no specificity regarding an order for costs, and no directions are otherwise sought, the default provision then applies and costs will be assessed at Column III.
