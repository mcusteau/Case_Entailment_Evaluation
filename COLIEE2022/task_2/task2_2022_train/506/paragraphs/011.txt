Astra and Takeda, by their submissions, seek to persuade me that the terms of my order are wrong or inappropriate in all of the circumstances. It is open to Astra and Takeda to take issue with my award of costs. It is their unqualified right to do so in the appropriate manner, i.e., by appealing my order. The purpose of rule 403 is to obtain precision with respect to costs:
Trade Arbed Inc. v. Toles Ltd. et al.
(2000), 196 F.T.R. 299 (T.D.). It does not provide an avenue to vary an order that specifies the costs to be awarded.
