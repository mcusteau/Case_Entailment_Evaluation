There is another H&C hardship criteria which warrants consideration. It is not the best interests of a minor child. It is not that the applicants have been in Canada for a number of years. It is not that the applicants have extended family in Canada, have good jobs in Canada and have bought a house in Canada. It is not that the economic and crime conditions in Guyana constitute an undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The hardship consideration which should be examined by an H&C officer is the daughter's sponsorship of the applicants. The applicants have been sponsored by their daughter for permanent residence status in Canada. This sponsorship application has been outstanding for one year, and the respondent has indicated that there are longer processing times for sponsorship applications of parents being experienced in the Mississauga office of the respondent than for other sponsorship applications. (The respondent advised the daughter of this fact in April 2008).
