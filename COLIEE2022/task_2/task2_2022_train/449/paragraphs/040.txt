It may be an "unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship" for the applicants to return to Guyana pending processing of the sponsorship application by the daughter due to the delay of the respondent's Mississauga office caused by the lack of bureaucratic resources. In other words, it may be a "disproportionate hardship" for the applicants to give up their house, give up their jobs, give up their Canadian community and resettle in Guyana, all for a period of time which may be a matter of months, or possibly one or two years, while the respondent's bureaucracy processes their application. The respondent can quickly and easily determine, on a "paper screening basis", whether the sponsorship application will likely be approved, and if on a "paper screening" it is likely that the sponsorship application will be approved, then the H&C officer may decide that it is an "unusual, undeserved and disproportionate hardship" for the applicants to have to uproot themselves from Canada only to return to Canada again soon thereafter.
