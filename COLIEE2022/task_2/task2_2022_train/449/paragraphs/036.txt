The applicants submit that the PRRA officer failed to be alive and attentive to the best interests of the minor applicant. The PRRA officer determined that the best interests of the minor applicant would not be adversely affected because he was familiar with Guyana and would have the support of his parents. The applicants submit that this finding does not apply the correct test:
"The officer here does not determine the
best
interests of Davendra, nor does he purport to do so. Rather, he is merely determining what is adequate for him. While the officer was not required to determine the application solely on the basis of the best interests of the child, he was required at least to identify what is best for him, and then weigh this against other considerations."
