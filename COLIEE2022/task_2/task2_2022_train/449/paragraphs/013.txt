"¶ 1 It must be emphasized that there is nothing about the Applicant's situation that suggests that it fits into a special category of cases where a positive decision might be made. The Applicants are simply would-be immigrants whose humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) application is primarily based on the existence of minor children and the fact they have been in Canada for a few years.

It would also create a positive incentive for foreign nationals to completely ignore regular immigration procedures. ...
