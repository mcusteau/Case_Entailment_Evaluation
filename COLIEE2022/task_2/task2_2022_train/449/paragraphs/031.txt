All Indo-Guyanese face the same threat of crime upon their return from Canada to Guyana. Accordingly, it was reasonably open to the immigration officer to decide that the applicants would not face "unusual or disproportionate hardship" compared to all Indo-Guyanese sent home from Canada after a failed refugee claim. An H&C finding otherwise, would "open the floodgates" as submitted by the respondent, in that all Indo-Guyanese would overstay their legal status in Canada, and file an H&C application on the basis that they face a likelihood of "hardship" if returned to their home country due to the prevalence of crime against the Indo-Guyanese in Guyana.
