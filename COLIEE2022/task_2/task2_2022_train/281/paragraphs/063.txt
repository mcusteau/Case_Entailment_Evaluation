In his second affidavit, Mr. Glowczewski provides a timeline for the products sold by the Applicant under the trademark TRADITION, and the promotion and sales related to those products. For example, he states that the Applicant sold frozen bagels from 1993 or 1994 to 2002. He also deposes that from his over 20 years experience in manufacturing and selling baked goods, that all baked goods are invariably displayed together in the same section of the grocery store. Moreover, he attests that it is not surprising that there are no instances of confusion between the parties' trademarks because sales related to the Applicant's products constitute only a fraction of the total retail grocery sales in Canada.
