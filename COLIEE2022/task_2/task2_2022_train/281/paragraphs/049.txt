[49]
In summary, the Board held that the Respondent had discharged its burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the Applicant's and Respondent's respective trademarks. The Board gave the following reasons for arriving at this decision:
(a) the Applicant's trademarks have very little inherent distinctiveness when used in association with food products;
(b) when considered in its entirety, the Respondent's trademark is entirely different from the Applicant's trademarks;
(c) no instance of confusion has been proven; and
(d) given the use of other trademarks containing the word "tradition", the average consumer would be able to distinguish between the Applicant's and the Respondent's trademarks.
While the Board considered the word mark "tradition", it also considered the trademarks in their totality. In its reasons, the Board concluded as follows:
"I would have reached the same conclusion if I had compared the Trademark to one of the Opponent's trademarks that contain a design portion. Indeed, the marked difference of the design portions of the trademarks in issue would add to the distinction between the Trademark and the Opponent's other trademarks."
