The Applicant filed a statement opposing registration of the Respondent's trademark on May 14, 1998. Pursuant to s. 38(2) of the
Act
, the Applicant specified the following as its grounds of objection:
(1) that the Respondent's trademark is not registrable under paragraph 12(1)(d) of the
Act
because it is confusing with the Applicant's trademarks;
(2) that the Respondent is not a person entitled to the registration of its trademark under s. 16(3) of the
Act
because the trademark is confusing with the Applicant's trademarks; and
(3) that the Respondent's trademark is not distinctive of the Respondent's wares and services as required by s. 2 of the
Act
.
The Applicant also claimed that the Respondent could not register its proposed trademark because it did not satisfy the exigencies of paragraph 30(I) of the
Act
, which required the Respondent to provide a statement with its application for registration that the Respondent is entitled to use the trademark in Canada in association with the wares described in its application. This ground of opposition was later abandoned by the Applicant.
