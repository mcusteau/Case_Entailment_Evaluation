Third, the Board dismissed the Applicant's claim that it holds a "family of trademarks" containing the word "tradition". The Board stated that, based on the evidence in the record, the word "tradition" is commonly used by others in the food industry. The Board cited the decision of
Man and His Home Ltd. v. Mansoor Electronics Ltd. et al.
(1999), 163 F.T.R. 270; 87 C.P.R.(3d) 218 (T.D.), in which Justice Pierre Denault stated that weak trademarks are to be afforded "a minimal level of protection". Because the Applicant's trademark was weak, the Board held that the concept of a family of trademarks was of no assistance to the Applicant.
