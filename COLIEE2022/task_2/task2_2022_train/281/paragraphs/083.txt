In its reasons, the Board considered the inherent distinctiveness of the parties' respective marks as required by s. 6(5) of the
Act
in deciding whether the marks are confusing. The Board found that neither the Applicant's trademark TRADITION nor the Respondent's proposed trademark TRADITION'L have much inherent distinctiveness. The Board went on to dismiss the third ground of opposition in respect of distinctiveness for the same reasons as those offered for dismissing the Applicant's opposition on the ground of confusion.
