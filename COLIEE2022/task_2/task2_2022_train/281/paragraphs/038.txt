Regarding the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks and the extent to which they have become known, the Board held that neither the Applicant's trademarks nor the Respondent's proposed trademark confer much inherent distinctiveness. Specifically, with respect to the Applicant's trademarks, the Board referred to
Tradition Fine Foods Ltd. v. Oshawa Group Ltd. et al.
(2004), 258 F.T.R. 125; 2004 FC 1011. In discussing the inherent distinctiveness of the Applicant's trademarks, Justice James O'Reilly stated the following at paragraph 38:
"... The plaintiff's trademark is a common word, suggesting of qualities worthy of respect and preservation, naturally associated with good food. This kind of trademark is less distinctive and generally merits less protection than unique trademarks: [citations omitted]. The evidence shows that the name 'Tradition', or some close variation of it, is used by many other food producers who co-exist in the marketplace seemingly without confusion."
The Board also commented that the Respondent's trademark is very weak because its word element is "highly suggestive of traditional bagels". In comparison, the Board found the Applicant's trademarks to be more known than the Respondent's registered trademarks, particularly given that the Respondent provided no sales figures for products bearing the trademark BAGEL TRADITION'L.
