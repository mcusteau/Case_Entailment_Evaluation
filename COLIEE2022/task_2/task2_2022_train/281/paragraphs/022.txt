Justice Barry Strayer in
Carling Breweries Ltd. v. Molson Companies Ltd.
(1984), 1 C.P.R.(3d) 191 (F.C.T.D.), at page 197, held that the burden of proof falls on the party applying to register the trademark, and that the onus was a heavy one:
"... There are various authorities to the effect that where one must prove that a normally descriptive word has acquired a secondary meaning so as to make it descriptive of a particular product, the onus is indeed heavy: [citations omitted]. ... The onus, as I noted above, is on the applicant for registration of such a mark to demonstrate clearly that it has become so distinctive of his product that it has acquired a secondary meaning which would not, vis Ã  vis the relevant public, normally be confused with the primary meaning of the word."
