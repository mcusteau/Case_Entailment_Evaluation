The caveat for imposing a more stringent standard of review is that the new evidence must be of such a nature that it would have "materially affected" the Board's finding of fact or the exercise of its discretion. That is, the mere existence of additional evidence is not enough to cause the Court to displace the deference generally afforded to the Board. As Justice Carolyn Layden-Stevenson noted in
Vivat Holdings Ltd. v. Levi Strauss & Co.
(2005), 276 F.T.R. 40; 2005 FC 707, at paragraph 27, the new evidence must have some probative value in order for it to be considered:
"To affect the standard of review, the new evidence must be sufficiently substantial and significant. If the additional evidence does not go beyond what was in substance already before the board and adds nothing of probative significance, but merely supplements or is merely repetitive of existing evidence, then a less deferential standard is not warranted. The test is one of quality, not quantity:
Garbo Group Inc. v. Harriet Brown & Co.
(1999), 3 C.P.R.(4th) 224 (F.C.T.D.);
Canadian Council of Professional Engineers v. APA - Engineered Wood Assn.
(2000), 7 C.P.R.(4th) 239 (F.C.T.D.);
Mattel, Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc.
(2004), 30 C.P.R.(4th) 456 (F.C.)."
As Justice Layden-Stevenson stated, whether the more exacting standard of correctness is warranted depends on the quality of the additional evidence tendered on appeal.
