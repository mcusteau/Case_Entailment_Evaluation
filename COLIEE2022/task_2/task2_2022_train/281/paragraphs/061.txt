The Respondent submits that the Court should not consider Mr. Glowczewski's new affidavit in this appeal. The Respondent argues that Mr. Glowczewski's affidavit does not add to the quality of the evidence that was already before the Board and, furthermore, that the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay. Alternatively, the Respondent submits that should the Court consider Mr. Glowczewski's new evidence in this appeal, then it must also consider the affidavits of Ms. Lithwick and Ms. Fraser.
