Regarding the Colabar advertising flyer, Mr. Glowczewski suggests that the flyer evidences the possibility that even grocers will confuse the Applicant's and the Respondent's products. Moreover, in its Memorandum of Fact and Law, the Applicant states that the flyer makes it clear that the parties' products "are being sold and distributed in the identical channels of trade and are sold side by side". In my view, such conclusions cannot be drawn from the flyer. In fact, I would suggest, given that products appearing side by side on the flyer are each listed under different corporate names, that grocers reading the flyer would be more inclined to the view that the two companies listed in each row are not the same. Moreover, I cannot see how the positioning of the Applicant's and the Respondent's products on the advertising flyer has anything to do with where they will ultimately be placed in the grocery stores, which is where consumers will encounter the products. As such, I see no probative value in this advertising flyer.
