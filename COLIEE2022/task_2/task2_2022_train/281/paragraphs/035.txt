In further comments about the evidence, the Board stated that it accepted that the Applicant had used the word mark "tradition" since at least as early as 1984 in association with frozen baked goods and frozen batter for making baked goods. However, the Board also noted that the Applicant's bagel sales did not begin until October 1995 and that its bagels were not packaged individually or in bulk bearing any of the Applicant's trademarks. Regarding the Respondent's sales, the Board pointed out that the Respondent did not provide any figures associated solely with the use of the BAGEL TRADITION'L trademark and, therefore, held that the Respondent's sales figures were of no assistance.
