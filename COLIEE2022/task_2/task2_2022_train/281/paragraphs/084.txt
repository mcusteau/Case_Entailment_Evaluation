In this appeal, the Applicant did not point the Court to any evidence ignored by the Board or to any evidence that establishes that the Respondent's proposed trademark is clearly descriptive. Moreover, in my view, the Board was entitled to consider the Respondent's proposed trademark as a whole and not break it down into its component parts in making its determination. On the evidence, the Applicant has not met its burden of proving that the word "tradition'l" or the imagery of the bagel and wheat sheaves is clearly descriptive of the intrinsic quality of bagels. As a result, it was reasonably open to the Board to dispose of the Applicant's opposition on the ground of distinctiveness as it did. In so doing, it committed no reviewable error.
