I agree with the Respondent that the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony is inadmissible as hearsay. In
R. v. Hawkins (K.R.) and Morin (C.)
, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043; 204 N.R. 241; 96 O.A.C. 81, at paragraphs 58 to 66, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the evidence by prior statement made by a witness in another trial is hearsay. Prior statements made in a different proceeding are generally rejected because they cannot be tested by way of cross-examination in the present proceeding. In
Walkerton (Town) v. Erdman
(1894), 23 S.C.R. 352, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a prior statement is only receivable if the person who made the statement is unavailable due to death or disability, or because that person cannot be found.
