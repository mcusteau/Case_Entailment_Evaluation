As for the nature of wares, services or business, the Board stated that while the Applicant's and the Respondent's wares fell within the same general class of "baked goods", there is a difference between a bagel and a muffin. Further, with respect to the Respondent's other wares and services, such as the preparation of take-out goods and catering services, the Board held that they are not of the same nature as that of the Applicant.
