Closer to home, in Kanematsu-Gosho Â (Canada) Ltd. et al. v. Midas Navigation Corp. (T-4200-75, May 15th, 1984, not published), Rouleau, J., of the Federal Court followed the McAlpine decision and dismissed an action after a delay of six years because the cargo officer and the office manager of the defendants were no longer in their employ and they had no idea as to their whereabouts. In McFetters et al. v. Drau Realty et al., 55 O.R.(2d) 722 (H.C.), the High Court of Justice of Ontario confirmed the dismissal of an action for want of prosecution following an unexplained delay of four years after discovery, and a cumulative delay of 13 years after the event giving rise to the action. The court held that a presumption of prejudice arose once the limitation period had expired (six years in Ontario, as in the instant case). There was no evidence to rebut that presumption.
