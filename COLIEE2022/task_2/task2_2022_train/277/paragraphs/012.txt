In Waterside Cargo Co-Operative v. National Harbours Board (1987), 3 F.T.R. 189 (F.C.T.D.), Muldoon, J., of this court found that the defendant was badly prejudiced because of a 10 to 12 year delay, as employees and officers of the defendant Board had left its service and were dispersed into retirement. The learned judge said as follows (at page 190):
"... But justice implies some balance or some equalizing. The plaintiff did itself an essential injustice, by its solicitor, in letting essential time run against itself and against the defendant. The equitable rule which comes to mind is that 'Equity aids the vigilant'. Here the plaintiff slept on whatever rights it had for almost all of the past five years."
