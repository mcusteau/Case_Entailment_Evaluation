Justice John A. O'Keefe of the Federal Court, noted, in
Charles
, above:
[32] The duty to provide reasons contributes critically to the accomplishment of an agency's mandate. As articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Baker
v.
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193, reasons fulfill a number of purposes:
- they ensure that issues and reasoning are well articulated;
- they allow parties to see that the applicable issues have been carefully considered; and
- they are invaluable if a decision is to be appealed, questioned, or considered on judicial review.
[33] According to the judgment in
VIA Rail Canada Inc.
above at paragraph 21, the purposes for providing reasons are relevant to their adequacy: "adequate reasons are those that serve the functions for which the duty to provide them was imposed."
[34] In the case at bar, I am of the opinion that these purposes have not been served by the reasons provided. The reasons provided by the IAD have not ensured that the reasoning upon which the decision was made was well articulated. Furthermore, the inadequacy of the reasons provided deprives the applicant of a full assessment of the possible grounds of appeal or review. This is especially relevant given that the IAD's decision is subject to a deferential standard of review. The IAD did not provide adequate reasons for its conclusion.
