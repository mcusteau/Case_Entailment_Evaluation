A. Because two gentlemen from Luni extended family came from abroad.
Q. What did they do?
A.
They were not satisfied with what we had conveyed
to them and they threatened us.
...
Q. Well, apparently everyone was satisfied before in the Luni family, so how did this new fight begin?
A. Because we had built a coffee bar and they wanted to get that coffee bar from us which we had built in the middle of the village.
