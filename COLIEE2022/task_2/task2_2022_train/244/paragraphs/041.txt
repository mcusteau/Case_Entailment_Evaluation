In respect of the mediation process, the country reports specify:
... the following description of the steps taken by mediators to resolve a blood feud: first,
[t] he missionaries have meetings with the families and they listen to the claims of both pairs. After this they contact persons who have great influence on each family. Than together with the persons of great influence, they go to the families, and continuously try to convince them to solve the conflict by legal [means]. If the family, whose member has been killed, does not accept the reconciliation and they insist in taking revenge, than the missionaries recommend to the killer's family to leave its village or city and go another city or state. Because the moving off of the killer's family soothes the hatred of the damaged family. All these meetings and efforts are confidential and they are not published (24 Oct. 2004).
The Chairman also stated that reconciliation efforts never stop, and in some cases continue for years, despite the fact the offended family may have taken revenge in the meantime (Committee of Nationwide Reconciliation 24 Oct. 2004).
