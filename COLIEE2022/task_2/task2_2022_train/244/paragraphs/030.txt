Mr. Keqaj submits that there are no details in evidence as to what agreement had been reached by the Lunaj family. There is no evidence that the Lunaj family took the Keqaj family land, in good faith, or, that they intended to keep the promises made previously. Moreover, there is no evidence that the two men, who returned from overseas, were not elders of the family and, given that they were invited by the mediators to participate in negotiations, it is clear that the Lunaj family and the mediators considered them as elders.
