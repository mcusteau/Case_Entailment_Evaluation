As to state protection to persons targeted by blood feuds, the country documents, state:
... despite some improvements in Albania's overall level of governance,
Albanian authorities were unable to protect victims of blood feuds
... also ... blood feuds continue, regardless of improvements, because the Albanian state remains somewhat ineffective ... Similarly, ... the "very fragile" Albanian state had failed to control the blood feud phenomenon ... In addition, ... the Albanian government has not taken any effective measures to combat blood feuds [and] may be reluctant to become involved in blood feud cases for fear of becoming targets themselves.
