Albania was once governed by a Communist regime. The Communist regime confiscated land owned by the Keqaj family and made it state land. In 1992, the Communist regime was defeated and the Democratic Party came to power. Mr. Keqaj's family made efforts to reclaim the confiscated land. In 1995, the Court granted the return of the land, located in the centre of the town, where the family proceeded to build a caf√©.
