Rejecting the applicant's claim in relation to cervical disc disease, the panel concluded:
"If the Appellant had suffered significant injuries to his neck and lower back, he would have had the obligation of complaining about these injuries. There is a complete absence of record or complaint or evidence of treatment in his file and even at the time of his release the Appellant didn't mention the injury. Moreover, the Board noted that when he sought his pension entitlement for a back condition, the Appellant didn't even mention the 1968 injury then. The basis of this claim lacks of credibility and the Board considers that the alleged incident of 1968 doesn't contribute in any way to the onset or acceleration of the onset or aggravation of the claimed condition."
