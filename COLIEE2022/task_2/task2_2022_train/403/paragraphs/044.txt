Sergeant Roughley's evidence is in the form of a letter, dated December 11, 1996. In the letter, Sergeant Roughley provides details of the April 1968 police chase and accident, as he was on duty that evening. While the letter provides some details of the events leading up to the accident, it does not give any information of injuries beyond the statement, "There were injuries, although I don't recall to what extent." Ultimately, this letter is of very little assistance in establishing the necessary link between the applicant's present condition and the 1968 accident. Quite simply, the letter is devoid of details of the nature of the injuries.
