It is well established in the jurisprudence that a decision-maker does not have to list each and every piece of evidence in a decision. It is presumed that the decision-maker had regard to all of the evidence tendered. In my opinion, the VRAB's failure to mention Dr. Boyko's letter is not fatal. This letter cannot be considered a diagnostic medical opinion such as Dr. Esmail's; rather, it is a report detailing the applicant's current treatment regime.
