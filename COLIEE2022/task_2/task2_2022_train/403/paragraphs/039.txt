The panel noted the absence of any mention of the accident and injuries in the applicant's medical and service records. In rejecting the medical opinions of Drs. Esmail and Tworek, the panel states:
"If the Appellant had suffered significant injuries to his neck and to his lower back, he would have had the obligation of complaining about these injuries. There is a complete absence of record or complaint or evidence of treatment in his file and even at the time of his release the Appellant didn't mention the injury." [see footnote 11]
