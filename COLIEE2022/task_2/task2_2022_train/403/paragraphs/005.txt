With regard to the applicant's claim for disability pension for cervical disc disease, the VRAB noted that the applicant based this claim on the April 1968 accident. The panel noted a witness statement, in the form of a letter, from the applicant's colleague, Dennis M. Roughley, which described the incident as follows:
"The Plymouth struck the driver's side front door of the Police Car. The extent of that damage, I cannot recall. I do remember that we got back in the P.C. and gave chase to apprehend the driver for several infractions of the law.
"We pursued the vehicle for several miles on a gravelled grid road, until the Plymouth entered a summer fallow field. You, Cst. Shmyr, followed the vehicle into the ditch. I also recall we suddenly came to an abrupt stop, after crashing head-on into a ditch. The Plymouth also stopped, after striking the ditch and crossing a road dividing two fields. I cannot remember all of the details of the accident, but remember it was several hours later, and after many aerial photos taken, that we were able to complete the investigation of this incident. There were injuries, although I don't recall to what extent." [see footnote 1]
