In
Weare v. Canada (Attorney General)
, Mr. Justice MacKay held:
"With respect to Mr. Weare, it is settled law that upon application for judicial review, the only evidence the court may take into account, in considering whether the administrative decision-maker erred, is that evidence that was before the decision-maker. On an application for judicial review, the merits of that decision may not be reargued upon new evidence not before the decision-maker. For this reason, I am unable to take into account, in rendering this decision, any of the evidence relied upon by the applicant dated after the Board's decision, including various letters between medical specialists said to support the applicant's case. I note only, on this point, that pursuant to s. 32(1) of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
, S.C. 1995, c. 18 (the '
Act
'), the Board retains jurisdiction to reconsider its decision on the basis of new evidence adduced by the applicant. This subsection reads:
'32(1) Notwithstanding section 31, an appeal panel may, on its own motion, reconsider a decision made by it under subsection 29(1) or this section and may either confirm the decision or amend or rescind the decision if it determines that an error was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law, or may do so on application if the person making the application alleges that an error was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law or if new evidence is presented to the appeal panel.'"
