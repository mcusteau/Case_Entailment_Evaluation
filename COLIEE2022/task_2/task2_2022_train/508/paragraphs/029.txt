McGillis, J., in
Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)
, supra, at p. 305 (C.P.R.(3d)), also refused to allow questions in the nature of discovery on a summary motion. Rules 1612 and 1613 were never intended to prolong a summary proceeding and I have already stated, in the circumstances of this case, they cannot affect a third party's rights without any notification. The applicants are on a fishing expedition to get parts of the NDS and all of the DMF. It is not essential to the main application for the applicants to obtain the sought after parts of the NDS and the DMF. The DMF belongs to a third party who is "not even involved in this litigation and who could be wrongfully affected by the disclosure of such information". See Rouleau, J., in
Glaxo Canada Inc. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) and Apotex Inc. et al. (No. 1)
(1987), 11 F.T.R. 118, at p. 120 (T.D.). The procedure under the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
was never intended to be the same as an action for infringement of a patent.
