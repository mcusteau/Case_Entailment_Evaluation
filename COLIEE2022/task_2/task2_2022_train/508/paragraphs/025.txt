The applicants withdrew their request for information under ss. 2.1.4 and 2.1.5. The respondent Nu-Pharm Inc. takes the position, and I agree, that the balance of s. 2.1 is not relevant. Furthermore s. 2.1.9 falls into the same category as the request for impurities under s. 2.1.3. There is no evidence before me to show any relationship between the information sought and the process of manufacture.
