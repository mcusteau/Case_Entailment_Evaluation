The foregoing is important because Pfizer and Nu-Pharm had proceeded as if this Notice of Motion was proceeding by way of judicial review. The drug supplier took the position it was not a matter that was res judicata since there had been no finding in this respect. McGillis, J., had indicated in
Bayer AG et al. v. Minister of National Health and Welfare et al.
(1993), 66 F.T.R. 137 (T.D.) that Part V.1 of the
Rules
under the
Federal Court Rules
governing application for judicial review ought to be followed by the parties. Rouleau, J., in a subsequent motion in the same case on July 23, 1993, agreed that it should be a judicial review but had felt that it should proceed by way of an action. There has been no order or direction pursuant to s. 18.4 to the
Federal Court Act
requiring that these proceedings be treated and proceeded with as an action.
