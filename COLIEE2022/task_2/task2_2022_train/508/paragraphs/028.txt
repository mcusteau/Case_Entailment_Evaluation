It is important to keep in mind the summary nature of these proceedings. Muldoon, J., had a different issue before him in
Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)
(1992), 41 C.P.R. 390 (F.C.T.D.), but his reasoning is applicable in this matter. He stated at p. 391:
"The prothonotary obviously had in mind a clear distinction between discovery and cross-examination upon an affidavit. Discovery may be had in an ordinary action with pleadings and the expectation of witnesses testifying viva voce at trial. That type of proceeding is an ancient norm in common law courts and during the time of the reforms in the judicature in the United Kingdom, adopted here, examination for discovery, orally and examination for discovery of documents have been added to the process. So the result there is that one may have a proceeding in which there is discovery, and there may be surprise witnesses or surprise testimony from those witnesses, even at trial, although discovery is meant to smooth out that possibility or diminish that risk.
"Here the applicant has chosen a form of proceeding which was more common in the Chancery courts, and that is an originating notice of motion. This proceeding is a summary proceeding, unlike the other. It is summary in that there is no discovery and no written pleadings. Applications may be supported and deposed by affidavit and the opposing parties may cross-examine on those affidavits. That is what has happened in this case, but the applicant is not entitled to discovery of documents in such a proceeding."
