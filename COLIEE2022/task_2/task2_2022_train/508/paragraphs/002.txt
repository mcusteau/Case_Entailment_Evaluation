Subsequently Denault, J., varied the order of McKeown, J., to permit counsel for Pfizer to view the Nu-Pharm NDS in the presence of counsel for Nu-Pharm in order to better determine the matters in issue. Counsel for Pfizer and Nu-Pharm attended at the Federal Court on August 31, 1993, and examined the Nu-Pharm NDS. Subsequently on September 7, 1993, Pfizer amended its request to include production of the Drug Master File ("DMF") filed with the Minister by the supplier of Nu-Pharm and referred to in the Nu-Pharm NDS. These proceedings were adjourned to today in order to permit the drug supplier to be notified and to be given the opportunity to make submissions. The drug supplier submits that the information in the DMF is confidential and the proprietary information of the drug supplier who is not a party to the proceedings and does not seek the status of an intervenor or a party.
