The officer also discounted the evidence because no "good reason" had been provided as to why the declarations were not submitted before the Board. In my view, this is not a relevant consideration.

The same applies, obviously, to the letters coming from the Mayor and the Deputy, if they were to be considered as evidence that arose before the Board's decision. (
