The standard of review applicable to PRRA decisions has been addressed extensively by this Court. For example, in
Kim v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2005 FC 437, [2005] F.C.J. No. 540 (QL), at para. 19, Mosley J. affirmed that "in the judicial review of PRRA decisions the appropriate standard of review for questions of fact should generally be patent unreasonableness, for questions of mixed law and fact, reasonableness
simpliciter
, and for questions of law, correctness." Given the recent change in Canadian administrative law, and the factual nature of the issues involved in the present case, I find the appropriate standard of review to be that of reasonableness.
