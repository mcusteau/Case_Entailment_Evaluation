I note that the applicant submitted a second declaration from Mr. Bano (page 323 of the Tribunal Record). This declaration explains why the previous declarations of both Mr. Bano and Mr. Gega were not dated and reiterates that the applicant's life would be in danger should he return to Albania. Despite forming part of the Tribunal Record, this declaration, which contradicts the PRRA officer's state protection findings, was not addressed in the reasons.
