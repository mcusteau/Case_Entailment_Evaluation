On the issue of state protection, the applicant mainly submits that the officer erred by according little weight to six declarations provided in support of his claim for protection. Of more relevance to the issue of state protection, the applicant submitted letters from state officials, the Mayor of Lushnje, Mr. Gega, and an Albanian Member of Parliament, Mr. Bano, which indicated that Albania could not protect him. While these letters explicitly state that Albanian authorities cannot protect the applicant, they were accorded little probative value and not mentioned by the officer in the state protection analysis.
