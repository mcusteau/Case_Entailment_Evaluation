In my opinion, the foregoing passage is instructive. While the PRRA process is not an appeal from a Board decision, there would be no point in admitting new evidence capable of contradicting a finding of fact by the Board, if it then could be given little probative value for the very reason that it was admitted. Thus, where new evidence is admitted that contradicts the Board's previous findings of fact, the evidence cannot be discounted solely because it contradicts prior conclusions, rather the capacity of the new evidence to temper those findings for the purposes of the present PRRA analysis must be evaluated.
