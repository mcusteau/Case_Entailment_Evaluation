  The confusion about the applicant's date of birth is not new evidence because this confusion was obvious in his file and there has not been any new evidence available since the decision of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB). Paragraph 113(a) of the IRPA states that, upon an application for a pre-removal risk assessment, the applicant must submit " . . . new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection." The problems regarding the date of birth existed well before the IRB's decision.
