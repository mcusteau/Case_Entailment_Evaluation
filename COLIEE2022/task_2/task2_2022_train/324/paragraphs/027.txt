Police forces are never entitled to arrest people in a discriminatory way even during a state of emergency. This is all the more true when an arrest may involve torture: see

v.
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1994] 1 F.C. 589 at para. 22. In the present case, the PRRA officer did not consider the two alleged arbitrary detentions of the applicant by the SLA, nor did she take into account his treatment during those detentions. She did not comment on the various reports according to which the use of torture to extract admissions and confessions is endemic. She said nothing about the requirement for Tamils living in Colombo to register with Sri Lanka police. She failed to consider the applicant's allegation of extortion by the police. In light of these oversights, I am of the view that her conclusions with respect to short detentions are patently unreasonable.
