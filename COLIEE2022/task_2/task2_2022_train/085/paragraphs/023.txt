  Moreover, it has been confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Minister of Citizenship and Immigration v. Patel 
 , 2002 FCA 55 at para 10, that the content of the duty of fairness owed by a visa officer is at the lower end of the spectrum (see also  
 Nodijeh 
  at para 3;  
 Dash v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2010 FC 1255 at para 27 [ 
 Dash 
 ] ;  
 Fargoodarzi v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2008 FC 90 at para 12 [ 
 Fargoodarzi 
 ]). Specifically, in the context of the decision of a visa officer on an application for permanent residence, the duty of fairness is quite low and easily met, "due to an absence of a legal right to permanent residence, the fact that the burden is on the applicant to establish [his] eligibility, the less serious the impact on the applicant that the decision typically has, compared with the removal of a benefit and the public interest in containing administrative costs" ( 
 Fargoodarzi 
  at para 12). The applicant is not entitled to anything more than the visa officer mentioning the evidence on which his decision was based ( 
 Dash 
  at para 29).
