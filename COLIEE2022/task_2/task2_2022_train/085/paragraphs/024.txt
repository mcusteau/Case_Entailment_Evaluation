  The officer considered the documents submitted by the applicant with his application, most notably his application form and the reference letter, and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish that he possessed the necessary work experience. He was then declared ineligible and reimbursed his application fees, but invited to reapply. Hence, the applicant knows why his application was denied and even what to correct if he chooses to reapply: the officer's reasons are sufficient and there was no breach of procedural fairness on his part, in this respect.
