  In the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes which were communicated on January 5, 2011, it states that the listed duties in the applicant's application are almost an exact copy from the description of tasks in the NOC for Restaurant and Food Service Manager: "The same information is in the JV letter so it is not possible to determine that PA meets MI - not eligible for processing."
