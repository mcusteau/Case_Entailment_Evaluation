  The applicant further claims the officer's decision is unreasonable because, in his view, the reason provided in the CAIPS notes is inconsistent with the written reason in his letter of refusal. While the letter states that the "duties that you listed do not indicate that you performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation", the CAIPS notes specify that the duties listed are actually an exact copy of the lead statement. The refusal letter however did go on to state that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant had the necessary work experience. When the letter is read in its entirety, it does not contradict what was said in the CAIPS notes: since the applicant's description and his reference letter were a copy of the NOC duties, there was insufficient evidence to establish that he possessed the necessary experience.
