Counsel for Garbo Group submitted that the only point on which the Registrar found in favour of the applicant was the dissimilarity between the goods of the applicant and those to which the "Garbo" mark attached, and hence the different channels of trade through which they would normally pass. Thus, counsel argued, if the Registrar erred on this point, I must allow the appeal.
