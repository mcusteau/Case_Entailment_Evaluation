[5]
Garbo Group has appealed from this decision pursuant to s. 56(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13, alleging that the Board erred in its conclusion that the proposed mark was not reasonably likely to be confused with the appellant's registered marks. The appellant filed affidavits in support of the appeal that were not before the Board. The respondent did the same.
