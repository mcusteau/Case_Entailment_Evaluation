Seductive as this submission is, I cannot accept it. Whether there is a reasonable likelihood of confusion depends on a consideration of the facts in the light of all the specific factors set out in s. 6(5), not all of which carry the same weight, including "all the surrounding circumstances". The court may still conclude that the Registrar's decision was not wrong, even though, in the light of additional evidence on one issue, the Registrar's finding on that issue was erroneous.
