It was held in
Cochrane-Dunlop Hardware Ltd. v. Capital Diversified Industries Ltd.
(1976), 30 C.P.R.(2d) 176 (Ont. C.A.), that a presumption that goodwill attached to a mark applied when it had been promoted by its owners and had been on the register for twelve years. The "Garbo" marks have been in use for a similar period of time and have been promoted by their owner through non-trivial, but not huge, expenditures on advertising and other forms of promotion over that period. The Registrar was thus clearly correct to conclude that the second factor favoured the appellant.
