Ms. Barham's conclusion on this issue was no doubt reinforced by her view that the "Garbo" marks had acquired little consumer recognition. She testified that, although an expert on the fashion industry, she had little recollection of goods sold under the "Garbo" marks. Hence, I attach considerable weight to Ms. Barham's evidence on the question of whether average consumers are likely to associate the mark "Greta Garbo" with the appellant's goods.
