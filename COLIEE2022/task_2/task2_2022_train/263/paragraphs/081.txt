The evidence of Ms. Barham is especially helpful on this point. Under questioning from the appellant's counsel, she stated that belts, handbags, sunglasses, eyeglasses, makeup, fragrances, watches, hosiery, and jewellery could all be considered to be fashion accessories. She later stated that fashion accessories are part of the fashion industry: respondent's application record, page 249, Question 110. However, she subsequently modified this statement by saying that, of the products on this list, she would not regard make-up as a fashion accessory: see page 289 of the application record.
