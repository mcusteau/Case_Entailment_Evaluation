Admittedly, there was little direct evidence on this point, save that of Ms. Barham which was not before the Registrar. She deposed that, if she saw the name "Greta Garbo" on goods, she would assume that they came from the estate of the famous actress and from no other source. It is true that Ms. Barham is not an average consumer with imperfect recollection, but an expert in the fashion industry. However, I do not think that this detracts from the weight of her evidence on this issue because it is not related to her expertise.
