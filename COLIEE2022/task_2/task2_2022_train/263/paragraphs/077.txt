[77]
A finding of a likelihood of confusion may be made on the basis of the similarity of the channels of trade, even though the goods in question are not sold in the same stores. Thus, in
Cartier Inc. v. Cartier Optical Ltd./Lunettes Cartier ltée
(1988), 17 F.T.R. 106; 20 C.P.R.(3d) 68 (T.D.), at p. 74 [C.P.R.], Dubé, J., said:
"However, so as to establish the likelihood of confusion, it is not necessary to prove that the wares are sold in the same places, provided they are of the same general class, could eventually be sold in the same places, and the parties are entitled to do so."
