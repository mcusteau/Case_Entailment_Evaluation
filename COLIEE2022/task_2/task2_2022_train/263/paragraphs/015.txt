It is generally said that the standard of review applicable to the Registrar's decision is that of correctness, although in view of the expertise of the Registrar, and of those to whom the Registrar has delegated decision-making powers under s. 63(3), their decisions should not lightly be set aside on findings of fact that are central to their specialized jurisdiction, such as whether confusion is likely to be caused by the proposed mark. However, when significant evidence is adduced on the appeal that was not before the Registrar, less weight should be given to the Registrar's findings:
Molson Companies Ltd. v. Labatt (John) Ltd. et al.
(1984), 1 C.P.R.(3d) 494 (F.C.T.D.);
United States Polo Association v. Polo Ralph Lauren Corp. et al.
(1999), 163 F.T.R. 59 (T.D.).
