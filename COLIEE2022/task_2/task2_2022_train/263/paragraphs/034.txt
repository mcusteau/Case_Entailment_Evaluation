To conclude, it is my opinion after weighing these factors that, despite the inclusion in the
Trade-marks Act
of an untrammelled right of appeal and the right to adduce additional evidence, a considerable degree of deference is called for on the part of the appellate court when reviewing the Registrar's finding of confusion, provided at least that no significant new evidence has been adduced on a factual issue and it is not alleged that an error of law has been committed.
