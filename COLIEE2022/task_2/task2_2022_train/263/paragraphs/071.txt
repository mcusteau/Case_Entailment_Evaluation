An appendix to Mr. Hayward's affidavit contained a floor plan of the Bay store in Victoria which showed accessories, jewellery and cosmetics displayed close together. Photographs of Bay stores in Toronto and Laval showing Garbo jewellery displayed near cosmetics counters were included in the affidavit of Gary Grundman. However, as Kevin O'Neil pointed out in an affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent, while cosmetics and jewellery are sold on the same floor in The Bay, so are many others. Further, eyeglasses are sold on a different floor.
