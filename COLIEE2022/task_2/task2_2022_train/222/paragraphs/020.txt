  In Kim v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 244, [2006] F.C.J. No. 318 (QL), a case in which there was substantial evidence of establishment, I concluded that the officer's reasons were inadequate because of a failure to address the submissions advanced by the applicants. There was evidence of the effect a return to Korea would have on the family which the officer did not address in any meaningful way. There was no line of analysis that could lead the reader from the evidence to the conclusion reached that no hardship would be suffered.
