  The officer was obliged to make a decision based on the evidence submitted and her reasons, while terse, reflect an analysis based on the evidence produced. As Justice Frederick E. Gibson stated recently in Dhillon v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1067, 2005] F.C.J. No. 1336 (QL)at paragraph 24: 
 
 
 
 ...the onus on [the officer] was simply to demonstrate by her reasons that she had taken into account all of the evidence before her and had not taken into account irrelevant factors. It was not incumbent upon her to seek out additional evidence that might have influenced her decision.
