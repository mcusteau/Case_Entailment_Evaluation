  I agree with the applicant that in so far as the officer's reasons may be interpreted as stating that evidence of establishment alone will never be enough to justify an exception, that is a misunderstanding of the discretion afforded the Minister to waive visa requirements on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. However, in the context in which it was made, the statement may also be interpreted as expressing the officer's conclusion that the evidence of establishment was insufficient in this case.
