  Relying on the decision of Justice Anne L. Mactavish in Adu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 565, [2005] F.C.J. No. 693 (QL)[Adu], the applicant contends that it is not enough that reasons be provided to fulfil the requirements of Baker, but that the reasons must also adequately explain the decision rendered. At no time does the officer explain why the applicant's six years of residency in Canada, school upgrading and work history were insufficient to establish undue hardship if he is forced to leave Canada.
