  The standard of review governing decisions of immigration officers in relation to H & C applications is reasonableness: Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193. The decision overall must, therefore, be able to withstand a "somewhat probing examination": Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Competition) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, [1996] S.C.J. No. 116 (QL). A question as to the sufficiency of reasons raises an issue of procedural fairness to be decided against a standard of correctness: Attorney General v. Fetherston, 2005 FCA 111, [2005] F.C.J. No. 544 (QL).
