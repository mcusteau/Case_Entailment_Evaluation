  While an H & C decision must be supported by reasons (see Baker, above ) it is inappropriate to require administrative officers to give as detailed reasons for their decisions as may be expected of an administrative tribunal that renders its decisions after an adjudicative hearing: Ozdemir v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2001), 282 N.R. 394 , 2001 FCA 331; Agot v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2003) 232 F.T.R. 101, 2003 FCT 436 (F.C.T.D.).
