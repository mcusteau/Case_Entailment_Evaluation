  With regard to judicial economy, I am not satisfied that the circumstances of this case warrant the expenditure of scarce judicial resources. The relief sought by the applicant would have no practical effect on her rights since she no longer requires a leave of absence for the 2004 federal election. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a decision by the Court at this juncture would assist the applicant in a future request for a leave of absence since her circumstances, including her position and responsibilities, could very well have changed by that time.
