  In some instances, the Court will choose to expend judicial resources to hear a case that is of a recurring nature, but evasive of review. The present application is certainly evasive of review because of the strict timelines involved. The founding meeting of the riding association took place on January 30, 2004, the applicant applied for a leave of absence on February 2, 2004 and the nomination meeting took place on March 30, 2004. Since the Commission communicated its decision to deny leave on March 12, 2004, the applicant had only 18 days to proceed with a judicial review before the nomination meeting. That said, I am not satisfied that future cases involving a request for a leave of absence to seek nomination will be equally evasive of review. For example, there is nothing to prevent an employee from requesting a leave of absence before an official call for nominations is made. This could allow sufficient time for a judicial review from a negative decision, particularly if an expedited hearing was requested. As directed by Justice Sopinka in  
 Borowski 
 , supra, "it is preferable to wait and determine the point in a genuine adversarial context unless the circumstances suggest that the dispute will have  
 always 
  disappeared before it is ultimately resolved" (emphasis added).
