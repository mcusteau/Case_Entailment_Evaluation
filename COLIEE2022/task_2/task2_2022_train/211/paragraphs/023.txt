  The Court may also exercise its discretion if an application raises issues which engage the national or public interest. Although important values are implicated in this case, the decision is very factual and applies discretely to the applicant and does not engage the public interest in a practical sense. Given that a decision by the Court would have no practical effect for the applicant or for the public, I conclude that judicial resources should not be expended to hear the present application.
