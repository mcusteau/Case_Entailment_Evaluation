  The issues to be determined are: 
 
 
 
 1. should the application be dismissed as moot? 
 
 
 
 2. if the application is not moot: 
 
 
 
 (a) what is the applicable standard of review for the Commission's decision? 
 
 
 
 (b) did the Commission err in denying the applicant's request for an unpaid leave of absence to seek a nomination as a candidate for political office?
