  It is well-settled that an administrative decision-maker need not refer to every piece of evidence before it. Unless the contrary to shown, a decision-maker is presumed to have considered all of the evidence. See:  
 Florea v. Canada (MEI) 
 , [1993] F.C.J. No. 598 (C.A.) (QL). In this case, the Officer expressly noted the documentation filed by Ms. Chertyuk in support of her application for permanent residence, including credit card bills, an insurance policy, letters, a lease, a marriage certificate, and driver's licenses. In short, Ms. Chertyuk has failed to displace the presumption that the Officer considered all of the evidence.
