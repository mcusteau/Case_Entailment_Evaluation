  Ms. Chertyuk also submits that the Officer erred by failing to consider all of the relevant evidence. Specifically, Ms. Chertyuk points to a medical insurance policy, which named her as beneficiary, a number of long distance telephone bills, which showed calls to her family in Ukraine and Mr. Shishmanov's family in Bulgaria, and numerous pictures, which depicted her and Mr. Shishmanov at the wedding, family gatherings and on vacation. The Minister, on the other hand, argues that the evidence relied upon by Ms. Chertyuk merely indicates that she and Mr. Shishmanov were cohabitating and does not speak to the issue of whether the marriage was entered into for the purpose of acquiring status under the Act. Put simply, the Minister takes the view that the Officer considered all of the evidence before her. Ms. Chertyuk has failed to persuade me that the Officer erred by ignoring relevant evidence.
