  The third issue raised by Ms. Chertyuk is, in essence, a challenge to the Officer's conclusion that she entered into marriage with Mr. Shishmanov for the primary purpose of acquiring permanent residence status under the Act. Under the Spousal Class, the determination of whether a marriage is genuine has traditionally been reviewed on the reasonableness simpliciter standard. See e.g.:  
 Osazuma v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2007 FC 1145, 69 Imm. L.R. (3d) 259 at para. 24. In the wake of the decision in  
 Dunsmuir 
 , the Court has accepted, albeit in a different context, that the reasonableness standard of review is now applicable to such findings. See:  
 Mustafa v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2008 FC 564, [2008] F.C.J. No. 717 at para. 13 (QL).
