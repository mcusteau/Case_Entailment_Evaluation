 [15] 
  The Officer found that the marriage between Ms. Chertyuk and Mr. Shishmanov had been entered into for the sole purpose of acquiring permanent residence status under the Act for Ms. Chertyuk. Accordingly, the Officer refused Ms. Chertyuk's application under the Spousal Class. In support of her conclusion, the Officer noted that: 
 
 
 
 རྭ in his PIF, Mr. Shishmanov stated that he first discovered "that [he] did not have an attraction towards women" when he was a teenager and that he feared persecution in Bulgaria on account of his homosexual orientation; 
 
 
 
 རྭ in his interview, Mr. Shishmanov stated that the information contained in his PIF was correct, that he had sexual relationships with several men throughout his adult life, and that he was not bisexual; 
 
 
 
 རྭ Ms. Chertyuk and Mr. Shishmanov did cohabit; and 
 
 
 
 རྭ the timing of the alleged intimate encounter between Ms. Chertyuk and Mr. Shishmanov and the subsequent marriage proposal coincided with the refusal of Ms. Chertyuk's request for an extension of her visitor status. 
 
 
 
 The Officer was of the view that Mr. Shishmanov and Ms. Chertyuk were "living together as friends" and that he was "assisting her to acquire permanent residence in Canada." The Officer found to be incredible the evidence that Mr. Shishmanov changed his homosexual orientation after his encounter with Ms. Chertyuk.
