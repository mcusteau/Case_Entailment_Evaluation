  Ms. Chertyuk further argues that the Officer fell into error by considering the timing of her relationship with Mr. Shishmanov in relation to her unsuccessful application to extend her visitor visa. Timing is said to be irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether or not a marriage is genuine. Ms. Chertyuk also contends that the Officer failed to consider the decision in  
 Donkor v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2006 FC 1089, 299 F.T.R. 262, which holds that a marriage originally entered into for the purpose of gaining status under the Act may later become genuine. The Minister adopts a contrary view, stating that it was open to the Officer to consider the circumstances surrounding Ms. Chertyuk's visitor visa. As to the effect of the decision in  
 Donkor 
 , the Minister argues that it is not applicable in this case given the Officer's "serious doubts about the relationship throughout." I do not find that the Officer fell into error as Ms. Chertyuk suggests.
