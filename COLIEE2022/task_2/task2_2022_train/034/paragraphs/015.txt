  The applicant's submissions focus on whether the Officer assessed the risks the applicant faced in determining hardship or simply relied on the fact that the risks had been considered in the PRRA application. The applicant also submits that the Officer unreasonably found that the applicant would not be personally at risk of hardship if returned to Sri Lanka, but would face only the same general risks as other young males. The applicant submits that personalized risk is not required in a H&C determination.
