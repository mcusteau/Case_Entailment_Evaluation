  Additional submissions for the H&C application were made in April, 2012 but were not available to the Senior Immigration Officer (the Officer) at the time of the April decision. The Officer then considered the additional submissions and issued an addendum to the reasons on July 11, 2012. The Officer refused to grant the exemption as she was not satisfied that the applicant's return to Sri Lanka would result in hardship that was unusual and undeserved or disproportionate.
