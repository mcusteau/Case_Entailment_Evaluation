The application for permanent residence was denied without a personal interview. The applicant says he was entitled to a personal interview so that he could clarify his training and experience as a Chef-Cook for the visa officer. However, his application for permanent residence is clear. He applied to work as a Chef-Cook and there was nothing in the application or material he submitted that demonstrated training or experience in that occupation. In other words, there was nothing to clarify.
