In each of the cases, the Member considers the applicability of the Guideline in the circumstances and then decides whether the order of questioning should be varied. There are no indications in these exhibits that Board members believe that they will be punished for failing to implement the standard order of questioning. Nor do they support the conclusion that the Guideline has the effect of causing a member, in conducting a hearing, to question whether he or she can adopt a particular procedure or a particular order of questioning of a claimant when the Board member legitimately holds the view that the standard order prescribed by the Guideline is not the best or fairest way to proceed in the circumstances.
