Since its implementation in June 2004, this Court has examined Guideline 7 in a number of decisions. The jurisprudence to date has not dealt specifically with the issue of waiver as it relates to an applicant's ability to argue Guideline 7 upon judicial review. Among the cases, there are two common scenarios in which the Court has addressed Guideline 7. The first scenario is one in which the applicant raised an objection to the implementation of Guideline 7 at the hearing before the Board and the issue of waiver was not dealt with on judicial review.
