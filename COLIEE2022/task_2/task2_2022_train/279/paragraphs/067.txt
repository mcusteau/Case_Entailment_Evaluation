Under Guideline 7, it remains open to each claimant in a refugee determination hearing to fully present any element of his or her case that the RPO or Board member does not explore in their initial questioning and to have the effective assistance of counsel in so doing. Were it to foreclose such an opportunity, I would have no hesitation in finding that the right to a hearing was being denied. But that is not the result of the implementation of Guideline 7. While fundamental justice entitles a refugee claimant to a fair hearing, it does not entitle him or her to "the most favourable procedures that could possibly be imagined":
