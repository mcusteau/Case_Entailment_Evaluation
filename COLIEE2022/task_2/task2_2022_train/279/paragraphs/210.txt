[210]
In two cases which were decided before the implementation of Guideline 7 but which relate to the order of questioning at a refugee hearing, the Court found a breach of the duty of fairness despite a failure to object at the hearing. In
Ganji
, the Court quashed a decision of the Board in which the Board had seized control of the applicant's case and conducted the examination. In
Herrera
, as discussed above, counsel had consented to the procedure without full disclosure of the issues to be raised. The Court refused to give any weight to the consent.
