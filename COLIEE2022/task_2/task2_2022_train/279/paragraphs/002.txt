This guideline, entitled "Guideline 7 - Concerning Preparation and Conduct of a Hearing in the Refugee Protection Division", was the subject of a recent decision of Justice Edmond P. Blanchard in
Thamotharem v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2006] F.C.J. No. 8; 285 F.T.R. 45; 2006 FC 16. In reasons dated January 6, 2006, Justice Blanchard found that Guideline 7 unlawfully fettered the discretion of members of the Refugee Protection Division ("RPD") and held that the decision that was before him would be quashed and the applicant's claim remitted for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. In an Order dated January 19, 2006, Justice Blanchard allowed the application and certified three questions as being of general importance in accordance paragraph 74(d) of
IRPA
. An appeal and cross-appeal have been filed from this decision.
