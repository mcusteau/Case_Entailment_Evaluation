[82]
As I read the Court's reasons, this decision does not stand for the proposition that the claimant's counsel must always question first but rather, whichever procedure is followed, that the claimant must be given fair notice of the issues and a fair opportunity to be heard. A similar reading of this decision was reached by Justice Blanchard in
Thamotharem
and by Justice Snider in
Zaki
