The five factors discussed by Justice L'Heureux-Dub√© in
Baker
are not exhaustive of the considerations that may indicate that a higher degree of procedural protection is required. In
Thamotharem
, Justice Blanchard also considered the particular vulnerabilities that are found among refugee claimants, which he found to militate in favour of an increased requirement for procedural protections. However, he concluded, at paragraph 90, that the fact that many refugee claimants are vulnerable and as a result have difficulty testifying effectively does not necessarily make Guideline 7 unfair. It was a factor to be considered in each case but did not necessarily dictate that the order of questioning should always be counsel-first.
