[165]
On the face of the record in this case, the evidence does not in my view support a finding of fettering similar to that considered by the courts in
Ainsley
and
Ha
. Unlike the case of the policy statement in
Ha
, for example, the text of Guideline 7 itself allows for consideration of the particular circumstances of each case and for exceptions to the standard practice to be made. If members were in any doubt about this, the general policy statement which the Chairperson has issued respecting all of the guidelines states expressly that they are not binding and cites a decision of this court to that effect:
Fouchong v. Canada (Secretary of State)
(1994), 88 F.T.R. 37; 26 Imm. L.R.(2d) 200 (T.D.).
