In upholding that decision, the Court of Appeal held that the two factors of particular importance in determining whether a guideline has "crossed the Rubicon" dividing the not always clear line between guideline and regulation are the language of the statement and the threat of coercive action. In that case, the guideline read like a statute or regulation. Further, it made a direct link between compliance being "in the public interest" and the Commission's power to sanction for infringement of that interest. As stated by Justice Doherty for the Court, "[t] he threat of sanction for non-compliance is the essence of a mandatory requirement".
