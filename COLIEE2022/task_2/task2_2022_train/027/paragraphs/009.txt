  According to a Notice of Reassessment for the year 2000, which is part of the record in this proceeding, the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency (the "CCRA") treated the pay equity amount received by Ms. Heaman as income earned that year for purposes of the  
 Income Tax Act 
 . The sole ground of Ms. Heaman's appeal to the Review Tribunal is whether the pay equity amount received by her in 2000 should be treated as income earned in that calendar year for the purposes of determining the amount of Supplement payable to her. Thus, section 28(2) of the  
 OASA 
  is engaged.
