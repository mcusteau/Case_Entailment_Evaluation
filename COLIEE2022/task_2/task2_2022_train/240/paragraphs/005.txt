The Board found that the applicant failed to demonstrate that she faced an ongoing risk or continued threat of persecution in Colombia. In particular, the Board noted that there was no evidence that the paramilitaries had sought out or harmed the applicant, her children or her aunts while she hid at her aunt's home after her escape from the mountains. The Board also noted that the paramilitaries have not approached either of the applicant's aunts since the applicant left the country in 1997.
