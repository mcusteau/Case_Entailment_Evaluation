 [39] 
  As to the type of evidence that must be adduced by a trademark owner in a s. 45 proceeding, the Federal Court of Appeal observed in the  
 Plough 
  decision, previously cited, that it is not sufficient for a registrant to simply state that a mark is in use. Rather, the owner must: 
 
 
 
 "[S]how with respect to each of the wares and services specified in the registration whether the trade mark is in use in Canada and if not the date when it was last used and the reason for the absence of such use since that date. The purpose is not merely to tell the Registrar that the registered owner does not want to give up the registration but to inform the Registrar in detail of the situation prevailing with respect to the use of the trade mark so that he, and the Court on appeal, can form an opinion and apply the substantive rule set out in s. 44(3) [now s. 45(3)]. There is no room for a dog in the manger attitude on the part of registered owners who may wish to hold on to a registration notwithstanding that the trade mark is no longer in use at all or not in use with respect to some of the wares in respect of which the mark is registered.
