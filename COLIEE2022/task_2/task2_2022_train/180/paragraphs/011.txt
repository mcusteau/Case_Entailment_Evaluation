  The Registrar identified the test for special circumstances as being that established by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Registrar of Trademarks v. Harris Knitting Mills Ltd. 
 , [1985] F.C.J. No. 226; 60 N.R. 380; 4 C.P.R.(3d) 488 (F.C.A.). There the Court identified three criteria that must be considered in determining whether special circumstances excusing non-use could be found to exist in a given case. These are: 
 
 
 
 1. The length of time during which the trademark has not been in use. 
 
 
 
 2. Whether the registered owner's reasons for not using its trademark were due to circumstances beyond its control; and 
 
 
 
 3. Whether there exists a serious intention to shortly resume the use of the mark.
