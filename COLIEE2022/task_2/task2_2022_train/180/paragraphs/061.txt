 [61] 
  In all of the examples of the mark in evidence in this case, the word "TARGET" appears to be the dominant feature, with the words "APPAREL" and "CO." appearing in a smaller font. In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the addition of the word "Co." does not amount to a material variation in the mark.
