  In coming to this conclusion, the Registrar noted that the evidence did not demonstrate that any steps had been taken by Fairweather with respect to the mark in the six months between its assignment of the mark and the issuance of the s. 45 Notice. Moreover, the Registrar observed that Mr. Brener's evidence regarding steps taken by the company after receipt of the s. 45 Notice consisted of bare statements that the company was in the process of developing labelling and sourcing products. No details regarding the labelling and sourcing processes had been provided, nor had any indication been given as to where Fairweather was in the process.
