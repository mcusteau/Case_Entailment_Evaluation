 Mactavish, J. 
 : This is an appeal by Fairweather Ltd. from a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks expunging its "TARGET APPAREL" trademark from the Trademarks Register. Fairweather asserts that the Registrar erred in finding that it had not established a serious intention to commence using the TARGET APPAREL mark in Canada in association with the registered wares, and in failing to find that special circumstances existed excusing the non-use of the mark.
