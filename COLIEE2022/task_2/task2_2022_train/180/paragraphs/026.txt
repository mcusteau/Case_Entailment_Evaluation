  In deciding whether the impact of this new evidence is sufficient to warrant a review on the standard of correctness, I am guided by the comments in  
 Garbo Group Inc. v. Brown (Harriet) & Co. et al. 
 , [1999] F.C.J. No. 1763; 176 F.T.R. 80 (T.D.). Here, Justice Evans noted that in assessing the impact that additional evidence will have for the standard of review, the question is the extent to which the additional evidence has a probative significance that extends beyond the material that was before the Board. If the new evidence adds nothing of significance, but is merely repetitive of existing evidence, without enhancing its cogency, the issue will be whether the Board was clearly wrong.
