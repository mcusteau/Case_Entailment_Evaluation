  There is no requirement that a license agreement be in writing: see  
 TGI Friday's of Minnesota Inc. v. Registrar of Trademarks 
 , [1999] F.C.J. No. 682; 241 N.R. 362 (F.C.A.). I have referred earlier in this decision to the close relationship between Fairweather and International Clothiers Inc. In all of the circumstances, I am satisfied that an inference can reasonably be drawn that International Clothiers Inc.'s use of the mark was made under an arrangement with Fairweather that was tantamount to an oral licence, and that the mark remained under the effective control of Mr. Benitah and Fairweather.
