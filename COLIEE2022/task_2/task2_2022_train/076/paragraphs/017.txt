  This Court has established that the Board has an obligation to explain why it certain documentary evidence was preferred to contrary sources. In  
 Jean v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.C.J. No. 1768, 2006 FC 1414, Layden-Stevenson J. reaffirmed this principle: 
 
 
 
 [11] The documentation also contained negative comments. The RPD did not refer to, or acknowledge, the statements of the representative of the crisis centre. Those accounts were to the effect that "most complaints of domestic violence received by the police were not taken very seriously and were placed on the 'back burner.' The prevailing attitudes of the police and the population in general are that the man of the household is the chief and that he can impose discipline in the home by violent means." There were also declarations that the "entire justice system needs to be modernized to reflect the seriousness of domestic violence". Additionally, the documentation contains an admonition that, despite years of promises from the government, there are no legal aid clinics in the country.

 None of the negative information regarding the availability of state protection was addressed. While it is clearly open to the RPD to ultimately prefer the statements of one spokesperson over those of another, in so doing it must first deal with both and provide its reasons for choosing one position over the other. It is not open to it to adopt only the positive statements and totally disregard the negative statements without providing an explanation as to why it has done so. It is settled law that evidence that directly contradicts the findings of the board must be acknowledged
