  Second the Board concluded that the applicant had an IFA in Mexico. The Board stated that the Gender Guidelines as well as the psychological report submitted by the applicant were considered. It was found that there was no serious possibility of the applicant being persecuted in another location in Mexico, and that it was not unreasonable in the circumstances for the claimant to seek refuge within Mexico. The Board offered the following reasons in support of this conclusion: 
 
 
 
 A. The Board found that it would not be unreasonable for the applicant to live in a large city such as Mexico City if she avoided contact with her family, and thus Mr. San Juan. 
 
 
 
 B. The Board found it would not be unduly harsh for the claimant to move to another part of the country. Given that the claimed is a well educated professional she could find employment in any major city. 
 
 
 
 C. The Board noted that Mr. San Juan no longer lives in Mexico City.
