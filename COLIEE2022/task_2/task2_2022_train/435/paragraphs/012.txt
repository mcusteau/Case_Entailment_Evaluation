In its analysis, the Board acknowledged that the documentary evidence showed the police in Bangladesh are used for the political purpose of harassing members of opposition parties. However, the Board stated that, since the BNP are now back in power, this is no longer an issue of concern for the Applicant. The Board stated that it preferred the documentary evidence that the police align themselves with whoever is in power, rather than the Applicant's evidence that many of the police in the districts are still working with AL goons. The Board stated that its reasons were that it "prefers the documentary evidence as it comes from neutral sources with no interest in the outcome of these proceedings." From this, I conclude that the Board was aware of and dealt with the essence of the Applicant's claim.
