In this case, the Applicant acknowledges that an IFA finding that was reached without error by the Board is determinative of the matter. I agree. This is because, whether under s. 96 or s. 97 of the IRPA, a claimant must demonstrate that he cannot avoid any persecution that he may be exposed to in his home location by relocating to another region of his country of origin. A finding that an IFA exists is, in essence, a determination by the Board that a claimant will not be subjected to persecution in the identified IFA.
