The key decision of the Board was made with respect to the existence of an IFA. Here, the Board found that the threat of harm to the Applicant by certain AL goons is of a localized nature, and could be avoided if he relocated outside Bogra, and is reduced in any case because the AL is no longer in power. The Board also found that there is no more than a mere possibility that the Applicant would face persecution by the police in a locale other than Bogra upon return to Bangladesh.
