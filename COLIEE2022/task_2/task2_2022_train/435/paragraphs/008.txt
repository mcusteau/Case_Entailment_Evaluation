[8]
In this case, the Board examined the application of an IFA to the situation of the Applicant under both s. 96 and s. 97 of the IRPA. Under s. 96, the Board examined whether the claimant would have a well-founded fear of persecution in the IFA and whether it is reasonable to expect him to relocate to the IFA. Under s. 97, the Board, in this case, stated that it only need consider whether the IFA is: (i) reasonably accessible to the claimant; and (ii) not a locale where the claimant would face a serious possibility of risk to life, or risk of cruel or unusual punishment. The Applicant does not raise an issue on the Board's approach to making its IFA determination. Nor does the Applicant assert that the Board erred by not considering whether the IFA was reasonably accessible to him.
