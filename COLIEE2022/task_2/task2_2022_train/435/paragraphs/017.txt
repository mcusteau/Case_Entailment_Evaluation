[17]
The Applicant proposes that I certify the following question:
"In a refugee protection determination by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, where the internal flight alternative is considered without an explicit determination on the risk to the claimant in the home locality of the claimant, is the explicit finding that there is an internal flight alternative a concession of a well-founded fear of persecution in the home locality of the claimant?"
