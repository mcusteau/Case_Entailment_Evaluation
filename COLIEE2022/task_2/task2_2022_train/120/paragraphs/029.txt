  This line of precedent was applied to forfeiture decisions under the current legislation in  
 Uanseru 
 . In that case, there was both a $5,000 performance bond and a $5,000 cash deposit. The officer decided not to enforce the performance bond but ordered the cash deposit forfeited. Justice Mactavish found that it was impossible to discern from the officer's reasons why she differentiated between the two. Thus there was no way of determining whether the officer relied upon considerations that were irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, one of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Canada et al. 
 , [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2; 44 N.R. 354; 137 D.L.R.(3d) 558, for determining whether discretion has been properly exercised.
