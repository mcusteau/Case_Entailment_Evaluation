  In  
 Gayle v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2002] F.T.R. Uned. 214; 20 Imm L.R.(3d) 80; 2002 FCT 335, a case arising under the former  
 Immigration Act 
 , Justice Eleanor R. Dawson assumed, without deciding, that the standard of patent unreasonableness was applicable to a forfeiture decision resulting from the breach of conditions imposed by immigration officials. In that case, Justice Dawson was reviewing whether the Operations Manager had exercised her discretion properly in deciding to forfeit the bond, not whether a finding of fact was improperly made.
