 [35] 
  The current  
 Act 
  is silent on the question of Ministerial discretion for the forfeiture of security deposits or performance bonds but provides, in s. 61, for the making of regulations for the application of Division 6 with respect to detention and release. Regulation 49(4) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
 , SOR/2002-227 (" 
 IRPR 
 "), provides that: 
 
 
 
 "49(4) A sum of money deposited is forfeited, or a guarantee posted becomes enforceable, on the failure of the person or any member of the group of persons in respect of whom the deposit or guarantee was required to comply with a condition imposed."
