  The respondent submits that there was contradictory evidence before the Operations Manager and therefore, it was open to her to assess the evidence and conclude that a breach of conditions of release had occurred.

The manager is entitled to weigh the evidence and has done so in this case to arrive at a finding of fact. This should not be lightly set aside.
