  Rule 81 of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
 , 1998 
 , requires that affidavits, other than on motions, shall be confined to facts within the personal knowledge of the deponent. That does not necessarily preclude hearsay evidence where its reliability and necessity can be established:  
 R. v. Khan (A.) 
 , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; 113 N.R. 53; 41 O.A.C. 353;  
 Ethier v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
 , [1993] 2 F.C. 659; 151 N.R. 374 (F.C.A.). I presume that the reliability of hearsay contained in FOSS notes can be established and that the notes may be introduced, where necessary, as the best evidence available of a person's immigration history. I also presume, however, that the personal knowledge contemplated by Rule 81 cannot be gleaned from reading notes in a file.
