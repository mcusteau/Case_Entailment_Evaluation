 [7] 
  The applicant seeks here to have that decision set aside and to have the matter referred back for determination at the final level of the grievance process in a manner consistent with the directions of this Court. He contends that the decision-maker erred in law. He should have treated the 1999 and 2003 Policies as legally binding on departments and he failed to apply "the requirement of formal notification" as requiring written notification of five weeks which the applicant did not receive. While the applicant casts his attacks on the decision in various forms, including unfairness, the use of irrelevant considerations, etc., and although he complains of the administrative decisions of the RCMP which led up to the termination of his employment, his essential and only relevant complaint in my view is that the grievance officer erred in law in his interpretation and application, or failure to apply, the 1999 Policy. The respondent concedes that the appropriate standard of review here is correctness (see respondent's submissions in its Record, page 6, para. 16) but denies that the 1999 or 2003 Policy had the force of law.
