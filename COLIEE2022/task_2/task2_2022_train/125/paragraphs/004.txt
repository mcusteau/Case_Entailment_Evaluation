  The 1999 Policy, as it applied to the RCMP, was replaced by a new Term Employment Policy effective April 1, 2003. This Policy had the same general objectives but directed departments, in respect of term employees who had had at least three years continuous appointment, to appoint them on an indeterminate basis.
