  I respectfully agree with Rouleau, J., that there is no indication in the Policy or its context that it should be treated as a law which must be taken to have conferred a term appointment on the applicant to April 4, 2003. Indeed there is a counter-indication in the  
 Public Service Employment Act 
 , supra, s. 25 which provides that: 
 
 
 
 "25. An employee who is appointed for a specified period ceases to be an employee at the expiration of that period."
