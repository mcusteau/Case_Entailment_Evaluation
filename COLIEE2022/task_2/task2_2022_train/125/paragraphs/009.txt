  As for the standard of review it is common ground between the parties, and I agree, that what is essentially involved here is an interpretation of the words of the 1999 Policy. The applicant regards this as a question of law. The respondent is reluctant to accede to the characterization of the Policy as "law". However both agree that the appropriate standard of review is correctness. I believe this is consistent with the pragmatic and functional approach because what is involved is the attribution of meaning to a form of words - "formal notification", a phrase which courts are as well or better able to define compared to a final level grievance officer. I believe it can be said that as a matter of law the grievance officer had to proceed on a correct interpretation of the words of the Policy.
