Ms. Augusto claimed refugee protection in Canada. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board dismissed her claim. The RPD determined that she had not provided any credible evidence in support of her claim. It also relied on documentary evidence which stated that the government and UNITA had arrived at a peace accord in April of 2002 and that amnesty was being provided to any person who committed crimes against the state or who was imprisoned during the war.
