  This approach is consistent with the decision of Justice Near, as he then was, in  
 JMSL v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 
  2012 FC 1274, [2012] FCJ No 1374 at paras 18-19 [

  I am satisfied in this case that the Officer considered all of the evidence before her and came to a reasonable conclusion. Her cognizance of the "problems [the Applicants] face at the hands of the Mara Salvatruchia [ 
 sic 
 ]" is clear from her identification of the decisions pertaining to their refugee and PRRA applications.  
 Given subsection 25(1.3) of IRPA, it was reasonable for the Officer to determine that the Applicants' fears had already been addressed in those other applications, and to focus on the hardship that might be suffered by the Applicants if returned to El Salvador to apply for permanent residence.

  As the Respondent rightly points out, the documents referred to in pages 145 to 188 of the Application Record consist primarily of identification documents and police record checks. The only document that relates to the particular problems the Applicants might face with respect to MS is a single affidavit sworn by Mrs. R.E.A.D.S., which alleges that she received threatening phone calls asking for the Applicants' whereabouts. There was no specific mention of this document in the Applicants' submissions, and there is no other corroborating evidence. The Officer is entitled to weigh the evidence before her, and need not mention every piece of evidence she considers. It is clear from the decision that the Officer considered the hardship that might specifically be faced by the minor Applicant and by the female Applicant. Her conclusion that this hardship did not amount to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship was reasonable. [Emphasis added].
