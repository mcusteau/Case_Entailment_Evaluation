  Justice Hughes raised the same issue is  
 Caliskan 
  that arises in this case: 
 
 
 
 [14] The question is, therefore, whether section 25(1.3) of IRPA, as amended, which exempts sections 96 and 97(1) considerations is itself constrained by the exemption to section 97(1) afforded by subsection 97(1) (b) (ii). Put another way, is the Minister, or Minister's Officer, still required to consider "generalized risk" in the context of considering "hardship"? 
 
 
 
 ... 
 
 
 
 [22] I conclude that the Guidelines got it right in construing how the amended provisions of section 25 of IRPA are to be interpreted. We are to abandon the old lingo and jurisprudence respecting personalized and generalized risk and focus upon the hardship to the individual. Included within the broader exercise in considering such hardship is consideration of "adverse country conditions that have a direct negative impact on the applicant".
