 Kane, J. 
 : Mr Kanthasamy is a now 20-year-old Tamil from the northern region of Sri Lanka who arrived in Canada in 2010 and claimed refugee protection. In February 2011, the Immigration and Refugee Board (the Board) refused his application, finding that Sri Lankan authorities had taken measures to improve the situation of Tamils, and that the applicant did not have a profile that would put him at risk upon his return to Sri Lanka. Leave for judicial review of the Board's decision was denied.
