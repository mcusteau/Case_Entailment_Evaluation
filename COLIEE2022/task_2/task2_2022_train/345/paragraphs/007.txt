A psychologist, Dr. Pilowsky, whom the applicant and his wife consulted in Toronto, testified that in her opinion the applicant was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition frequently found in victims of persecution. She went on to say that, while the applicant's condition had improved while he had been in Canada, the symptoms, including depression, acute anxiety, insomnia and a lack of interest in life, were likely to recur if he was required to return to Mexico, "the site of the traumatizing stressor", to use the words found in the report that Dr. Pilowsky prepared for the applicants' counsel. Dr. Pilowsky also reported that Ms. Cepeda was suffering from moderate anxiety and post-traumatic nightmares. For both of them, Dr Pilowsky concluded, a return to Mexico would be a "highly retraumatizing experience".
