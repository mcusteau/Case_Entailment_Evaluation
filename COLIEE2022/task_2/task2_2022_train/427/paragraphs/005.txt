It appears that the Board may have confused, at least in part and initially, the facts of two different claims in preparing its reasons for decision. The first paragraph of the Board's decision under the heading "Allegations" is entirely incorrect on the face of the record. In particular, the decision states that "[t]he claimant asserts a well-founded fear of persecution based on his perceived political opinion i.e., Movement for the Actualizations of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB)" and that the applicant alleged that he was detained in October 2003 and came to Canada in November 2003. Based on the testimony of the applicant and his narrative as laid out in his PIF this is entirely incorrect. Nowhere in his application does the applicant allege that he was a perceived member of MASSOB and in fact, the applicant came to Canada in January 2002, not November 2003 as the reasons of the Board state.
