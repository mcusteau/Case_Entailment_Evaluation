The applicant, a citizen of Nigeria, claimed he was a victim of political persecution and that he was arrested and detained by a vigilante group acting on behalf of state authorities. The claimant alleges that the authorities mistook him for his brother-in-law Onefe, a student, who had participated in a protest demonstration. The brother-in-law allegedly borrowed the applicant's car which was found close to the protest. The applicant stated in his personal information form and oral testimony that he was abducted and detained on two occasions. On one occasion, his family paid a bribe to secure his release from detention. Following the second detention, he remained in hiding until arrangements were made for him to flee Nigeria. The applicant left Nigeria in January 2002 and made a claim for refugee protection upon his arrival in Canada.
