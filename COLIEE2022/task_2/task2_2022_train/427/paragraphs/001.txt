Mosley, J.
: Mr. Agbon has twice been found by a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board, not to have a credible claim for protection. The first determination was overturned because a transcript of the hearing was not available to assess whether the Board made reviewable errors (see Agbon v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 2004 FC 356). The second finding should be set aside, Mr. Agbon submits, because the panel member made serious factual errors in his reasons for decision. These are my reasons for concluding that the errors are not material to the Board's central findings and the application must be dismissed.
