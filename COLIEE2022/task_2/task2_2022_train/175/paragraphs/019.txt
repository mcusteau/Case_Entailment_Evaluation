  I turn to consider other matters raised by the application for leave to appeal. In the applicant's undated eight page letter, received by the PAB which was accepted as an application for leave to appeal, the applicant raised the following principal concerns. 
 
 
 
 1. One member of the Review Tribunal appeared to be "totally unknowledgeable" about the disease SAD (seasonal affective disorder), a condition that the applicant claims to experience, so that it appeared to Mr. Callihoo that that member could not have made an impartial decision. 
 
 
 
 2. The decision of the Review Tribunal, in the applicant's view, was based more on earlier rather than later medical reports, and questions of the Tribunal members about his physical activities failed to deal with matters that would support some of the conclusions of the Tribunal about the extent and continuity of his activities. In another context, the Tribunal assumed that certain light treatment for SAD would assist the applicant, but it had been tried before the Tribunal considered his case, and had not helped and was discontinued. 
 
 
 
 3. Reviewing the facts of his case and some aspects of the Tribunal's report that are said to be in error, the applicant believes that he qualifies as disabled as that word is defined in the dictionary. When this application was heard, this concern was underlined by his subsequent qualification for benefits under the Alberta program for support of those who are disabled. The applicant expressed concerns about the definition of disabled relied upon by the tribunal.
