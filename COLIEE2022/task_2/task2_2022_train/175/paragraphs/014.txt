  Finally, in  
 Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v. Skoric 
 , [see footnote 12] the Minister sought judicial review and the setting aside of a decision of the PAB which had reversed the decision of a Review Tribunal and upheld a claim for a disability beneficiary's surviving spouse's benefit, under subs. 44(1) of the  
 Canada Pension Plan 
 . The application for review turned on the law and its application to undisputed facts, where the  
 Act 
  had been amended. Clearly the issue was a legal one and the standard of review required little deference to the PAB decision in the opinion of Mr. Justice Evans writing for the Court of Appeal. That conclusion, he noted, is consistent with that concerning the standard of review articulated by Reed, J., in  
 Kerth 
 , though I note the Court in  
 Skoric 
  was considering the decision of the PAB itself on its merits, circumstances distinguishable from those in  
 Kerth 
  and in this case where the issue arises in relation to the standard of review of a decision in regard to an application for leave to appeal.
