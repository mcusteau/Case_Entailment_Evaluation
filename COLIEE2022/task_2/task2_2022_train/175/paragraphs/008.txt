  The standard of review to be applied in relation to a decision of the PAB refusing leave to appeal has been considered in a number of recent decisions by my colleagues of this Court and by the Court of Appeal. The most recent from the Trial Division is  
 Davies v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) 
 , [see footnote 5] in which Mr. Justice Teitelbaum considered Madam Justice Reed's decision in  
 Kerth v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) 
 . [see footnote 6]
