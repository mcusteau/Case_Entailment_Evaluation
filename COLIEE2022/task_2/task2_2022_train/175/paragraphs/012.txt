  Two decisions of the Court of Appeal, both decided in December 1999, reached somewhat different decisions, for different reasons. In  
 Gramaglia v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [see footnote 8] that Court dismissed an appeal from the decision [see footnote 9] of Rothstein, J., as he then was, who had dismissed an application for judicial review of the decision of the Vice-Chairman of the PAB refusing leave to appeal the decision of a Review Tribunal where no new evidence was adduced with the application for leave, and the evidence before the Vice-Chairman, and the evidence before the Review Tribunal, had been considered by each of them and their conclusions could not be said to be unreasonable. The Court of Appeal was not persuaded that Rothstein, J., had erred in principle or in law or that he misapprehended the facts of the application, and it dismissed the appeal.
