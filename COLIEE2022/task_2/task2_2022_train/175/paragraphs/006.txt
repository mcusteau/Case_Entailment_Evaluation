  A Court hearing an application for judicial review under sections 18 and 18.1 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  cannot simply reverse or set aside a decision of a decision maker because the Court might have come to a different outcome. Decision makers who derive their powers from statutes are entitled, in review of their decisions, to a measure of deference in most cases. How much deference is to be accorded may range from little deference where the standard is correctness to substantial deference where the standard accepts decisions unless they are patently unreasonable. At the correctness end, a reviewing Court can reverse a decision if it is found to be simply incorrect. At the other end of the spectrum the decision can only be set aside if the error made by the decision maker is so unreasonable that it is without any foundation in evidence or law. Between the extremes of the spectrum a standard of reasonableness may be appropriate where the decision under review does not concern only a question of law and it is sufficient if it be supported by reasons that can stand up to a somewhat probing analysis. [see footnote 2] Essentially, there must be a foundation for the decision.
