  While the text of the Alberta legislation was not introduced before me, and it would be surprising if the provincial legislation simply duplicated qualifications for benefits for those who also qualified as disabled under the Canada Pension Plan, the issue thus raised was not fully developed and no further evidence of the nature of the provincial plan was adduced in relation to either the application for leave or this application for judicial review. Without further evidence than the brief reference in the fax letter there is not, in my opinion, any significant additional evidence raised by the application for leave when it was considered by the designated PAB member. The further reference in the written grounds for this application for judicial review, and the applicant's comments when this matter was heard, were not "evidence" before the leave decision maker; and they do not provide "evidence" warranting the Court intervening to set aside the decision refusing leave.
