 MacKay, J. 
 : The applicant seeks judicial review of a decision of the Pension Appeals Board (the "PAB") that refused the applicant leave to appeal an earlier decision of the Review Tribunal, which had rejected an appeal from the Minister who denied the applicant's claim for disability benefits. The Review Tribunal had decided, in a decision dated October 29, 1997, that the applicant was not disabled within the meaning of subs. 42(2) of the  
 Canada Pension Plan 
  [see footnote 1] (" 
 Plan 
 " or the " 
 Act 
 "). The decision under review by a designated member of the PAB who denied leave to appeal, was dated December 8, 1998.
