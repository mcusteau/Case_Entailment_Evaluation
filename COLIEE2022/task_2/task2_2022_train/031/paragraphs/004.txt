  There have been six days of discovery of the defendant Saverio Schiralli to date, including one day devoted to the remedial issue; counsel anticipate that another three days will be required on this issue. The discovery of the two other defendants has not yet commenced, although it may not require as much time as that spent on Save­rio Schiralli since the alleged infringements only go back for approximately 10 years. The fact that the defendants are said to have a number of product lines is a complicating factor in the discovery directed at determin­ing the amount of any unlawfully made profits that they may be required to disgorge to the plaintiff. Counsel for the defendants, the moving party in this motion, estimated that five days of the trial were likely to be required on the remedial issue.
