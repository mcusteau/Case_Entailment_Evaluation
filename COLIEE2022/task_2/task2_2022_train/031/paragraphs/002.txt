  The plaintiff's statement of claim alleges that the defendants have infringed its rights under the  
 Trade Marks Act 
  through the manufacture, importation, marketing and distribution in Canada of a liqueur with a name and get-up confusingly similar to that of a product of the plaintiff. In the case of the defendant, Saverio Schiralli Agencies Limited, liability is alleged to extend over a period of nearly 30 years, while the infringeÂ­ments allegedly committed by the other defendants commenced only in the late 1980s.
