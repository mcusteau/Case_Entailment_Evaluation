 Visx Inc. v. Nidek Co. et al. 
 , [1998] F.C.J. No. 811; 150 F.T.R. 92 (T.D.), in which Hugessen, J., held that the principles governing the separation of issues under former rule 480 were applicable to the current rule 107. Giles, A.S.P., inferred from Hugessen, J.'s, reasons that the case law establishing those principles continued to be binding. The relevant test he summarized as follows:

 necessarily 
  be some saving of expense and time if disÂ­covery and trial of damages or profits is postponed until the matter of liability is settled. The fact that discovery and trial time would be reduced if the defendant were successful at trial, is not sufficient ..." (emphasis in original).
