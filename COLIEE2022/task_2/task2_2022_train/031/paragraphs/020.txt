  On balance, I have decided that the defendants have not discharged the burden of establishing on the balance of probabilities that savings of expense and time are sufficiently likely, and the interest of a just disposition of the proceeding on its merits sufficiently likely to be advanced, as to justify departing from the general principle that all issues in a proceeding should be dealt with together. In reaching this conclusion, I have been particularly influenced by the following considerations: the paucity of information in the defendants' affidavit; discovery is already under way; the existence of profits is questionable; delays in the final disposition of the case are likely to be prejudicial to the plaintiff; and the difficulty of totally disentangling questions of law that go to liability from those pertaining to the remedy to be granted, if any.
