  With an economy and simplicity that characterize the 1998  
 Rules 
 , rule 107 pro­vides: 
 
 
 
 "(1) The court may, at any time, order the trial of the issue or that issues in proceed­ings be determined separately." 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 "(1) La cour peut, à tout moment, ordonner l'instruction d'une question soulevée ou ordonner que les questions en litige dans une instance soient jugées séparément." 
 
 
 
 As Hugessen, J., pointed out in  
 Visx 
 , an order under rule 107 does not preclude a further order, if appropriate, that the quantum of damages or profits be determined by a reference under rule 153 to the extent that they raise questions of fact alone.
