  One of the most comprehensive decisions dealing with the mandatory/directory question is  
 Rahman v. Alberta College and Association of Respiratory Therapy 
 , [2001] A.J. No. 343; 2001 ABQB 222.  
 Rahman 
  was a case which involved the failure by a professional disciplinary committee to commence its hearing within the 90-day period stipulated in the legislation. In concluding that the use of the word "shall" was merely directory, the Court relied (in paragraph 25) upon the following passage from David J. Mullan,  
 Administrative Law 
 , 3rd Ed. (Scarborough: Carswell, 1996), at page 317: 
 
 
 
 "244 The courts are more likely to favour strict adherence to procedural provisions where private rights are affected than if the requirements relate to the performance of a public duty the invalidation of which would cause serious general inconvenience or create anomalous situations. In the latter situation, the courts usually hold such provisions to be directory only. The courts are reluctant to allow non-adherence to mere formalities and technical requirements to defeat the validity of decisions in a manner that is contrary to the public interest. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "246 The courts tend to treat statutory requirements regarding time as mandatory and sometimes describe them as conditions precedent to jurisdiction. However, a breach may not give rise to a remedy if no substantial prejudice results or where treating the provisions as mandatory would defeat the purpose of the statute."
