 [11] 
  I accept that the use of the word "shall" within a statute is an indication of a mandatory or imperative intent. Section 11 of the  
 Interpretation Act 
 , R.S., c. I-23, lends support to that usual approach. However, s. 3(1) of the  
 Interpretation Act 
  does allow for a deviation from the norm where "a contrary intention appears". It is clear from the case authorities that a contrary intention has been fairly frequently recognized in connection with statutory duties of the sort created by s. 27(1) of the  
 Act 
 . Often such provisions are found to be directory, albeit subject to judicial supervision by way of mandamus for unreasonable delay.
