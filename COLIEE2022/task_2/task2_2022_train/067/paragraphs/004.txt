  The Plaintiff requested a ministerial review of the seizure action pursuant to s. 25 of the  
 Act 
  and the matter was assigned to an officer with the Customs Appeals Directorate of the CBSA. On May 14, 2004, the CBSA provided the Plaintiff with its reasons for the seizure action and invited her to provide additional information which she believed would be helpful to her claim. The Plaintiff's legal counsel did provide an explanation for her actions along with some further material delivered to the CBSA by letter dated June 7, 2004. The CBSA responded by letter dated June 17, 2004, and indicated that a further inquiry would be made with respect to the Plaintiff's contention that she had failed to comprehend the questions posed to her during the border examination. That letter also indicated that the CBSA was not in a position to turn over copies of the "officer's reports", but pointed out that it would be open to the Plaintiff to seek that material by way of a formal Access to Information and Privacy request. At a subsequent point, it does appear to be the case that an Access to Information request was made on behalf of the Plaintiff but the results of that process do not appear in the Record.
