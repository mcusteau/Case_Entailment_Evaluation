  The Plaintiff's Statement of Claim also alleges that the forfeiture decision made by the border officer and confirmed by the CBSA Minister's delegate was without foundation and patently unreasonable. Although not expressly pleaded, this claim to relief clearly falls within the Court's judicial review jurisdiction pursuant to s. 18(1) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S. 1985, c. F-7 and does not fall within the appeal jurisdiction conferred upon the Court by s. 30(1) of the  
 Act 
 . This dichotomy has been somewhat reluctantly recognized in at least two previous decisions of this Court, specifically  
 Dokaj v. Minister of National Revenue 
 , [2005] F.C.J. No. 1783; 282 F.T.R. 121; 2005 FC 1437, and  
 Tourki v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 
 , [2006] F.C.J. No. 52; 285 F.T.R. 291; 2006 FC 50. The problems arising out of a bifurcated approach to the judicial scrutiny of seizures of this sort are several and obvious and those problems were duly noted in both the  
 Dokaj 
  and  
 Tourki 
  decisions. Such a process does not contribute to the efficient use of judicial resources and, in a case like this, it forces a litigant to make difficult choices about the allocation of scarce resources. The awkwardness of this process is aggravated by the fact that the time limit for a s. 30 appeal under the  
 Act 
  is 90 days, whereas the time to commence a judicial review application is only 30 days post-decision.
