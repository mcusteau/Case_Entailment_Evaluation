 Barnes, J. 
 : The Defendant Ministers have applied for summary judgment pursuant to rule 213(2) of the  
 Federal Courts Rules 
 , SOR/98-106, seeking a dismissal of the Plaintiff's action. I accept that this is an appropriate case for summary judgment because I am satisfied that the only genuine issue raised by the Plaintiff's Statement of Claim and in the affidavit material is a question of law which can be resolved on a preliminary basis. Rules 213(2) and 216(2)(b) apply to this motion. They provide: 
 
 
 
 "213(2) A defendant may, after serving and filing a defence and at any time before the time and place for trial are fixed, bring a motion for summary judgment dismissing all or part of the claim set out in the statement of claim. 
 
 
 
 "216(2) Where on a motion for summary judgment the Court is satisfied that the only genuine issue is 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 (b) a question of law, the Court may determine the question and grant summary judgment accordingly."
