  The Plaintiff's action against the Ministers is brought pursuant to s. 30(1) of the  
 Act 
 ; the Statement of Claim seeks declaratory relief and an order requiring that the funds seized be returned to her. That part of the claim is presumably brought as a challenge to the ministerial decision which confirmed that the Plaintiff had violated s. 12(1) of the  
 Act 
  by failing to declare. The Plaintiff has not alleged in the Statement of Claim that the seizure was not justified at the time it was carried out but says, rather, that the Minister's delegate lost jurisdiction over the matter by failing to render a decision within 90 days as required by s. 27(1) of the  
 Act 
 . The Plaintiff says that that time limit is mandatory and the delegate's admitted failure to comply with it is fatal to the seizure and forfeiture action.
