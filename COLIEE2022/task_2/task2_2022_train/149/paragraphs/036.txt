  Very recently, in Kanendra v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2005] F.C.J. No. 1156 (F.C.)(QL), S. NoÃ«l J. also concluded that the LTTE was engaged in subversive or terrorist activities. Although the Court in that case was dealing with a person excluded pursuant to section 34(1)(f) of the Act, this finding may still be relevant if the Court was referring to the relevant period of activities.
