  This is indeed an error but it is not sufficiently material to justify setting the decision aside because there was no need in this particular case to find that the applicant's contribution was indeed significant. The Canadian case law is clear that when dealing with an organization with a limited and brutal purpose, a person who has knowledge of the activities of the group, who neither takes steps to prevent them from occurring if he has the power to do so, nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity and who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. (Penate, above, at paragraph 6)
