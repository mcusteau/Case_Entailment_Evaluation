  Having carefully reviewed the transcript of the hearings, I am satisfied that the applicant clearly testified that he knew very well that the LTTE was murdering civilians and members of other Tamil movements even before 1986 (Certified Record at pages 475 to 479, 503 and 504). He also knew about the massive expulsion of Muslims when it happened in 1990 (page 488).
