  The issue of whether or not the applicant was complicit in the crimes committed by the LTTE is a question of mixed facts and law to which I will apply the standard of the reasonable decision. This standard will also apply to the mixed question of facts and law of whether the LTTE was an organization with a limited and brutal purpose. ( Atabaki v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2005] F.C.J. No. 1192 (F.C.)(QL), Hussain v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2004] F.C.J. No. 1430 (F.C.)(QL) at paragraph 30, Pushpanathan v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2002] F.C.J. no 1207 (F.C.)(QL) at paragraphs 35 to 40.)
