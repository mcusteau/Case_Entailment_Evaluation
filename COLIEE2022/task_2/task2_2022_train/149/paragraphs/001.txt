 Gauthier, J. 
 : Mr. Nagamany seeks judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (RPD) rejecting his claim as a refugee or as a person in need of protection on the basis that he was a person excluded from consideration pursuant to section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act) because there were serious reasons to consider that he was complicit in the crimes against humanity committed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
