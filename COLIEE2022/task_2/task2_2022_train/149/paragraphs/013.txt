  Before coming to its conclusion in that respect, the RPD made several findings which are relevant to the issues raised by the applicant: 
 
 
 
 1) The applicant worked for at least seven years with the LTTE. He contributed, perhaps in a significant manner, to their operation. 
 
 
 
 2) The applicant worked voluntarily with the LTTE and not out of fear, as claimed. 
 
 
 
 3) Although he did not directly participate in any of the crimes against humanity committed by the LTTE, he had knowledge of those crimes at the relevant time. 
 
 
 
 4) The LTTE is an organization with a limited and brutal purpose. 
 
 
 
 5) The applicant did not try to disassociate himself from the LTTE at the first opportunity.
