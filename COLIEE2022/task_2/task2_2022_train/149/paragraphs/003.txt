  Mr. Nagamany testified that in 1986 while he was completing his studies or had just finished them (19 years old), he was forcibly recruited to work with the LTTE's student unit called the S.O.L.T. He worked with them every weekend for two years, that is until September 1988 when he was arrested and detained by the Indian Peace-Keeping Forces (IPKF) until April 1989. He believes that they arrested him and a friend to obtain information about another one of their friends who was a member of the LTTE or a close collaborator. During his seven months in jail, he was tortured but was finally released when his mother bribed his jailors. As he was injured, Mr. Nagamany allegedly went to Nalur and then to Colombo because he was afraid of the IPKF.
