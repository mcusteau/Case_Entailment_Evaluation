  The reasoning of Blais J. in Pushpanathan, above, is in that respect, perfectly in line with the views of the Federal Court of Appeal in Moreno v. Canada (M.E.I.), [1993] F.C.J. No. 912 (F.C.A.)(QL). Although the general rule is that membership in an organization involved in crimes against humanity is not sufficient to establish guilt by association, the Court said at paragraph 45 of this decision that an exception may apply to "the organization whose very existence is premised on achieving political or social ends by any means deemed necessary".
