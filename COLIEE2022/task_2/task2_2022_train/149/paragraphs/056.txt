  I shall first deal with another more factual error raised by the applicant in respect of this finding. The decision under review indicates that the word "perhaps" was included because the RPD was not sure if the claimant was lying about his real contribution to the LTTE or if he was just trying to embellish his story when he mentioned that he had been offered a rank of colonel by the LTTE.
