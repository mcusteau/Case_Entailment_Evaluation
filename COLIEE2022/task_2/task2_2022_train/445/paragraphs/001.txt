Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise out of an application for judicial review of a decision of Daniel Rousseau, at the relevant time Second Secretary at the Canadian High Commission in New Delhi, India, exercising authority as a visa officer (the "visa officer"), wherein he determined that the applicant did not meet the immigrant selection criteria and therefore rejected the applicant's application for permanent residence in Canada. The decision in question is dated September 1, 1994 and was apparently communicated to the applicant on October 25, 1994.
