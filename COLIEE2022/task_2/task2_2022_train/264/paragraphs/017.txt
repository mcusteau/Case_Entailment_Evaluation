I will refer to some doctrine and jurisprudence.
Referring to Administrative Law
, Third Edition, David, J., Mullan cites at page 240, paragraph 111:
"Adequate notice requires that the decision-maker supply persons who are entitled to notice with sufficient information on the nature of the proceedings and sufficient warning of the intention to make a decision as will enable them to prepare their proofs and arguments for presentation and to respond to the proofs and arguments anticipated from those maintaining a contrary position, and to appear and participate effectively at any oral hearings. (1) In proceedings where there are contesting parties, this obligation may extend as far as requiring that each side reveal to the other matters that it intends to put in issue at the hearing.
