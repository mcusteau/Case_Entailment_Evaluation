In
Stocking
, above, Justice Nadon stated at paragraph 16:
"The Appeal Division's letter of August 21, 1997, which I reproduced in full earlier, does not constitute adequate or reasonable notice to the applicant. If the Appeal Division intended to review the applicant's file to determine whether the stay should be continued, as it was entitled to under subsection 74(3) of the
Act
, it could and should have given the applicant notice of its intention to do so. What the applicant was informed of was that the Appeal Division would inquire whether he had complied with the terms of the stay. The evidence, as found by the presiding member, was that the applicant had complied with the terms imposed upon him. That, in my view, should have been sufficient to dispose of the issue before the Appeal Division on October 20, 1997. In the circumstances, I am therefore of the view that the rules of natural justice require that the decision of the Appeal Division be set aside. If the Board wishes to review the original stay it has the jurisdiction to do so, however, the rules of natural justice require that the applicant be notified of the Board's intent and be given the opportunity to respond."
