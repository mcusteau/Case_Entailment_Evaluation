Also, the Supreme Court of Canada in
Confederation Broadcasting (Ottawa) Limited v. Canadian Radio-Television Commission
, [1971] S.C.R. 906, held:
"It is quite plain that the requirements of natural justice demand that a person have full and complete notice of the charges against him and an opportunity to reply thereto. It has been said in this Court in two recent decisions:
Regina v. Quebec Labour Relations Board, ex parte Komo Construction Inc.
, [1968] S.C.R. 172; 1 D.L.R. (3d) 125] and
Quebec Labour Relations Board v. Canadian Ingersoll Rand Co. Ltd. et al.
, [1998] S.C.R. 695; 1 D.L.R. (3d) 417], that the requirement of natural justice did not extend to demanding that a hearing policy be had. These cases cited by counsel for the respondent on the present appeal are not, in my opinion, important on the present issue because here there was a hearing but in both judgments it is said plainly that 'each party be given the opportunity to put its arguments' (
Komo
case) and 'what is required is that the parties be given the opportunity to put forward their arguments' (
Canadian Ingersoll Rand
case).
"In the present case, the complaint is not that there was not a hearing but that the respondent failed to indicate in any fashion whatsoever what issue would be considered on that hearing."
