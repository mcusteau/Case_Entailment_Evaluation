In
Stocking
, above, the Minister sought to have the terms of the appellant's stay amended and it was only at the hearing that the Board decided to review and cancel the appellant's stay and dismiss his appeal. The IAD is entitled, under subsection 74(3) of the
Act
to review the applicant's file to determine whether the stay should be continued, however, the applicant must receive adequate and reasonable notice of such a course of action. In
Stocking
, the applicant was not provided adequate and reasonable notice that the Board wished to review the original stay. As such, there was a breach of natural justice.
