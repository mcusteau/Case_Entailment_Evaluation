In the present matter the applicant relies on the decision of Justice Marc Nadon in
Stocking v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, Â [1998] F.C.J. No. 993; 153 F.T.R. 198 (T.D.), to reinforce its claim that it did not receive proper notice of the nature of the hearing. In
Ponnusamy v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 962; 184 F.T.R. 222 (T.D.), at paragraph 9, Justice W. Andrew MacKay comments on Justice Nadon's decision in
Stocking
:
"In
Stocking
, the Minister sought to have the terms of the appellant's stay amended. The Appeal Division gave notice to the appellant that an oral hearing would be held 'in order to ascertain whether the terms of the stay have been complied with.' There was no question in
Stocking
that the appellant had complied with all the terms set out in the stay of his deportation order. At the oral hearing, the Board of its own motion decided to review and cancel the appellant's stay and dismiss his appeal. Mr. Justice Nadon concluded, upon judicial review, that the Board could, if proper notice is given, examine the appellant's conduct and make such an order. In the circumstances where only notice of review of compliance had been given and compliance was proven, Nadon, J., concluded that the decision to cancel the stay and dismiss the appeal could not stand."
