  Considering the evidence that was before the Board in the present case, I believe the following words of the Court of Appeal in  
 Sivakumar 
  equally apply here: 
 
 
 
 "33 ... Given the seriousness of the possible consequences of the denial of the appellant's claim on the basis of section F(a) of Article 1 of the  
 Convention 
  to the appellant and the relatively low standard of proof required of the Minister, it is crucial that the Refugee Division  
 set out in its reasons those crimes against humanity for which there are serious reasons to consider that a claimant has committed them. In failing to make the required findings of fact, I believe that the Refugee Division can be said to have made an error of law 
 ." (Emphasis mine)
