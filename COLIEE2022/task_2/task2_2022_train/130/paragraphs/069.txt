  Taking all of this into account, I believe that the evidence is such that on the basis of the correct approach, no properly instructed tribunal could have concluded that the applicant was not complicit in crimes against humanity, in light of his role and involvement with the AFRC. I believe this is therefore an appropriate case in which to dismiss the application for judicial review despite the errors committed by the Board outlined above. The application is therefore dismissed. No serious questions of general importance were proposed.
