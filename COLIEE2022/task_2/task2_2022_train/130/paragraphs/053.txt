  The same can be said in the present case. It is clear that the applicant was involved with the AFRC until they were ousted from Freetown. Though in the present case the Board relied on one piece of evidence that mentioned an atrocity which took place during and after the AFRC was ousted from power, a program of amputations from 1998 to 1999, it otherwise properly restricted its analysis to evidence that pertained to the time period in which the applicant was directly involved with the AFRC. Considering the totality of the evidence, though the Board's reasons could have been better structured, it cannot be said that they are unreasonable on the basis of this issue.
