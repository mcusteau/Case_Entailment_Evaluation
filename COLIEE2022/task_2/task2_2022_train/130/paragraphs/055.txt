  As noted above, in making findings with respect to crimes against humanity, the real issue is whether the acts are crimes against humanity as defined in the jurisprudence. As was recognized by the Court in  
 Chougui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 914; 2006 FC 992, at para. 11, on many occasions, the Federal Court of Appeal has adopted the definition of crimes against humanity found in section 6(c) of the  
 Charter of the International Military Tribunal 
 . Article 6(c) of the  
 Charter of the International Military Tribunal (Agreement for the Prosecution and Punishment of the Major War Criminals of the European Axis) 
  (82 U.N.T.S. 279) reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Article 6 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 (c) Crimes against humanity: namely, murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts committed against any civilian population, before or during the war; or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated." 
 
 
 
 See for example:  
 Sumaida v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2000] 3 F.C. 66; 252 N.R. 380 (F.C.A.), at para. 13 (C.A.) ( 
 Sumaida 
 );  
 Sivakumar 
 , above at para. 14.
