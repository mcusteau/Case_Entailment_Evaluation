  In the case of the AFRC, it is clear that the Board recognized that at some level it had political objectives. The Board recognized the fact that the AFRC had come into being after the duly elected government of President Kabbah was overthrown on May 25, 1997. The Board further characterized the AFRC's time in power as a period of violent and corrupt military rule. Despite this inherent political aspect to the AFRC, there is overwhelming evidence of violence and human rights abuses characterizing its period in power. Considering the evidence before the Board, it was not unreasonable of the Board to conclude that the AFRC's purpose was one that could be characterized as limited and brutal in that there was no evidence that its violent militaristic activities could be separated from what ever other objectives it might have had.
