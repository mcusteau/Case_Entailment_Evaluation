 [10] 
  The issues raised in the present case can be described as follows: 
 
 
 
 1) Did the Board err in misinterpreting the proper legal test to apply with respect to complicity? 
 
 
 
 2) Did the Board err in failing to provide adequate reasons with respect to the purpose of the AFRC? 
 
 
 
 3) Did the Board err in misapplying the test for complicity by: 
 
 
 
 a. finding that the AFRC has a limited and brutal purpose? 
 
 
 
 b. finding that the applicant was a knowing participant who held a shared, common interest with the objectives of the AFRC? 
 
 
 
 c. referring to atrocities committed after the period in which the applicant was involved with the AFRC? 
 
 
 
 4) Is the present case one in which the Court should exercise its discretion to dismiss the application, despite there being an error with respect to the crimes against humanity issue?
