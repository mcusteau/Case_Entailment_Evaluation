  The question as to whether the facts, as found, establish that an individual has been complicit in crimes against humanity is therefore reviewable on a standard of reasonableness, as this is a question of mixed fact and law:  
 Kasturiarachchi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 200; 2006 FC 295, at para. 12 ( 
 Kasturiarachchi 
 ). That being said, the question of what is required to make a finding of complicity is a question of law which must be reviewed on a standard of correctness.
