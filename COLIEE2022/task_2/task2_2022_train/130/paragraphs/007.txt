  In addressing the role of the applicant within the AFRC, the Board emphasized that though the applicant had only referred to his position as Secretary of State for Marine Resources in both his PIF and when he was questioned by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service upon his entry into Canada, he had also held other leadership positions in the AFRC government. When the applicant offered testimony trying to downplay his involvement with and knowledge of the activities of the AFRC, the Board did not accept his explanations as credible. The Board noted in particular that the applicant's progress into positions of increasing seniority was an indication that he was an integral member of the AFRC junta and a knowing participant in their plans and activities.
