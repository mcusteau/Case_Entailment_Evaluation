  In the present case, the Board specifically noted that the applicant attempted in his testimony to distance himself from the AFRC and downplay his role, however the Board clearly rejected the applicant's explanations as not credible. As previously noted, the credibility findings of the Board were not challenged in this review. The applicant asserts instead that there was evidence that the violations committed by AFRC members may not have been consistent with the objectives of the AFRC, in light of the denouncement of such actions by Major Johnny Paul Koroma. On the basis of this evidence the applicant argues that his knowing participation and his support of AFRC's objectives may not render him complicit, because the crimes at issue were in fact "isolated incidents" or crimes committed by rogue elements which were not obeying the orders of the organization.
