 [56] 
  In  
 Mugesera et al. v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration) 
  (2005), 335 N.R. 229; 2005 SCC 40 ( 
 Mugesera 
 ), the Supreme Court discussed crimes against humanity. As noted by the Court in  
 Kasturiarachchi 
  at paragraph 17, "[a]lthough the court was dealing with crimes against humanity in the context of admissibility, the discussion, in my view, is equally applicable to the issue of exclusion."
