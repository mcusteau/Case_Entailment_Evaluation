  The Board recognized that there was much reason for the applicant to try and distance himself from the AFRC, stating that the documentary evidence before the panel left no doubt as to the AFRC's nature. The Board found that the AFRC was an organization with a limited brutal purpose, and that the applicant was a leader of this organization. In reaching these conclusions, the Board relied significantly on Exhibit M-14, item 2, "Findings", Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Sierra Leone, 2004 (the "TRC Report"). The TRC Report sets out the findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (the "Commission") that was set up in Sierra Leone to make findings in relation to the causes, nature and extent of violations and abuses during the armed conflict of which the AFRC was a part.
