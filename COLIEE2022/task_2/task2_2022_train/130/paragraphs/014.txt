  With respect to the standard of review, to the extent that the issues raised go to findings of fact, they are to be reviewed on a standard of patent unreasonableness; where the question is one of mixed fact and law, they "can only be reviewed if they are unreasonable"; to the extent that they raise a question of pure law alone, such as the interpretation of the exclusion clause, "the findings can be reviewed if they are erroneous" i.e. the standard of correctness:  
 Harb v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration) 
  (2003), 302 N.R. 178; 2003 FCA 39, at para 14. Where the issue raised is one of procedural fairness, such as the adequacy of reasons, the standard of review is correctness, and the pragmatic and functional approach need not be applied:
