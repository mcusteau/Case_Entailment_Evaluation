  Whether delay justifies a stay of proceedings depends on all of the circumstances, including the purpose and nature of the case, its complexity, the facts and issues involved, and whether the affected person contributed to or waived the delay ( 
 Blencoe 
 , at para 122). The test is whether the delay caused "actual prejudice of such magnitude that the public's sense of decency and fairness is affected" (at para 133). There are three steps in considering whether a stay should be imposed: 
 
 
 
 1. There must be prejudice to the person's right to a fair trial or the integrity of the justice system. 
 
 
 
 2. There must be no adequate alternative remedy. 
 
 
 
 3. If there is uncertainty after steps 1 and 2, the court must balance the interests favouring a stay ( 
 eg 
 , denouncing misconduct or preserving the integrity of the justice system) against the public interest in having a decision on the merits ( 
 R v Babos 
 , 2014 SCC 16, at para 32).
