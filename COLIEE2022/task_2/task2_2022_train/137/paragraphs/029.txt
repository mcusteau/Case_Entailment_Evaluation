  Accordingly, the delay in dealing with Mr Fabbiano's admissibility resulted in his inability to present evidence to counter his removal from Canada. If his case goes to an admissibility hearing, the issuance of a removal order will be inevitable, and he will have no further remedies available to him (see  
 Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FCJ No 533, at para 47). Clearly, the delay has prejudiced him.
