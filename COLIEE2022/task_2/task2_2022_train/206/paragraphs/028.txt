  A central element to the Applicants' claim of persecution was the allegation that the Female Applicant had been forced to undergo a tubal ligation after the birth of her child. In its decision, the Board found that the Female Applicant's claim of having undergone forced sterilization lacked credibility. In particular, the Board drew a negative inference from the fact that the Applicants had not attempted to obtain any documentation from the hospital or from the psychiatrist whom she saw subsequently, which could have supported her claim. Moreover, the Applicants had not included this alleged event, which was central to their claim, in their original PIF. The Board was only informed of the alleged sterilization two days prior to the hearing through a letter from the Applicants' counsel.
