  Before the Board, when dealing with one alleged attack, the Applicants claimed that the failure of the police to attend at the scene of the crime impugned the state's ability to protect its citizens from racially-motivated attacks. In responding to this argument, the Board commented that, "It is difficult to understand what benefit it would have been for police to go to the scene well after everyone had left." The Applicant asserts that the failure of the police to attend a crime scene is clear evidence of the inadequacy of the state protection and that the Board's conclusion was unreasonable.
