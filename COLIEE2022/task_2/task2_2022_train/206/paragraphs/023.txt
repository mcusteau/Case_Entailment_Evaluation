  The case of  
 Geza 
 , above, where the Court of Appeal found a reasonable apprehension of bias, is clearly distinguishable. In that case, the Court of Appeal examined the Board practice of developing a "lead case" which would be followed by subsequent panels. The "factual matrix" in  
 Geza 
  involved an internal process in which various Board members, lawyers and staff of CIC apparently contributed to and guided the decision-making process on certain cases. The situation before me is far different, in that there is no evidence - beyond a few reported comments and some questionable statistics - that impugns the independence of the individual members of the Board.
