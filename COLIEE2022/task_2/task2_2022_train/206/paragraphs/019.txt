  Without a first-hand account of the entire interview or speech of the Minister (for example, either a transcript or affidavit from someone who was present when the comments were made), I have no knowledge of the context in which the remarks were made. Similarly, comments attributed to Professors Peter Showler and Audrey Macklin have not been confirmed by the alleged authors. In the presence of the very serious allegation of apprehension of bias, one would expect better evidence than selective statements taken from media sources.
