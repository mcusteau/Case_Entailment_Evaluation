 [4] 
  The Applicants seek to overturn the Board's decision, raising the following issues: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the Board err in concluding that there was no reasonable apprehension of bias? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Board err by relying on the wrong test for state protection? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the Board err: 
 
 
 
 a. in basing its finding that the Female Applicant's claim of sterilization lacked credibility on a misapprehension of the evidence and on an unreasonable negative inference drawn from the omission of the forced sterilization in the Personal Information Form (PIF) of both the Female and Principal Applicant; 
 
 
 
 b. in failing to consider the most recent documentary evidence on the lack of state protection for Roma persons; or 
 
 
 
 c. in failing to conclude that the failure of the police to attend the scene of a crime was evidence of the inadequacy of state protection?
