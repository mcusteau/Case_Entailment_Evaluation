  I accept that the Minister influences Governor-in-Council appointments and reappointments of Board members. However, this is insufficient to found a claim of a reasonable apprehension of bias. Under  
 IRPA 
 , the Board is independent from Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). The Board has its own chairperson. Every member of the Board is statutorily required to swear an oath of office requiring him or her to "faithfully, impartially and to the best of my knowledge and ability, properly carry out the duties of a (member) of the Immigration and Refugee Board". Members of the Board are appointed for set terms and are paid remuneration that is not dependent on how they decide cases. They can only be removed from office for incapacity, misconduct, incompetence or conflict of interest (See, for example,  
 IRPA, 
  ss. 152, 153, 156, 161, 162 and 170;  
 Oath or Solemn Affirmation of Office Rules (Immigration and Refugee Board) 
 , SOR/2002-231.). I have no evidence, beyond bare speculation, that appointments are made on the basis of prospective members' views of the Minister's speeches or that the renewal of Board member appointments is made on the basis of, or influenced by, their refugee claim acceptance rates.
