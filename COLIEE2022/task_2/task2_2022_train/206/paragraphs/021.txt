  Much reliance is placed by the Applicants on the reported statistics. The Applicants submit that the drop in the accepted refugee claims from Roma citizens of the Czech Republic is evidence of the negative impact that the Minister's statements have had. The Applicants allege that the Board's statistics show that such refugee claims had a 94% acceptance rate in 2008 and an 81% acceptance rate between January and March 2009, the first full quarter prior to the impugned statements. The acceptance rate in the quarter after the statements were made (July to September 2009) dropped to 30%, and the rate dropped to 0% in the last quarter of 2009.
