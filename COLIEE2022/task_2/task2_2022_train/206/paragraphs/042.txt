  Further, in their written submissions, the Applicants asserted that the Court, in  
 Cervenakova 
 , and the Respondent, in this case, incorrectly applied the test for actual bias rather than the test for a reasonable apprehension of bias. The arguments made by the Applicants may be improper as they could have been made in the hearing of this matter. However, to the extent that they are proper response to the request for submissions and having carefully read the decision in Cervenakova, I am not persuaded that Justice Crampton applied the incorrect test. Accordingly, the principle of judicial comity remains applicable.
