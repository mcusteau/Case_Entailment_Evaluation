  The Prothonotary decided that, since the evidence in the Ethier Affidavit was not before the decision maker at the time the decision was made, it is irrelevant. Post-decision evidence can be very relevant to an argument of "bad faith" or "bias", and, therefore, I find that the Prothonotary's ruling is unresponsive to the argument made and, thus, is made in error.
