  With respect to the Ethier Affidavit of May 30, 2002 (Applicant's Application Record, p. 88) exhibiting post-decision evidence, the Applicant argued before the Prothonotary that the evidence goes to the decision under review as having been made in "bad faith" and maintains this argument on the present appeal.
