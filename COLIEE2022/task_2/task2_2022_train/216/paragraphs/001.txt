 Campbell, J. 
 : The present appeal concerns specific findings made by Prothonotary Hargrave in a decision rendered on July 19, 2002 with respect to the late filing of two affidavits in the present judicial review application. I do not intend to repeat the substance of the Prothonotary's decision as these reasons are directed to the parties and should be read together with his written reasons.
