 [1] Reed, J. 
 : The applicant seeks an order quashing a decision of the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. That decision dismissed an appeal of the applicant which was brought pursuant to s. 77(3) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 seeking to quash the decision of an immigration officer. That decision refused to approve the sponsored application of the applicant's husband for landing. Counsel for the applicant argues that the Appeal Division did not address its mind to the proper question which was whether the immigration officer's decision was supported by the evidence before him.
