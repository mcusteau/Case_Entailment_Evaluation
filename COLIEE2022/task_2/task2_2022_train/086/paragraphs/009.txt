 [9] 
  As I read the Appeal Division's decision the finding that the husband lacked an intention to reside permanently with the applicant was only partly based on the applicant's evidence. She gave evidence to the Appeal Division concerning her husband's intention. With respect to that evidence, the Appeal Division gave it no weight because they found the applicant lacking in credibility. The Appeal Division also based its finding however on the husband's attitude as discerned from the record of the interview before the immigration officer. The inference that the husband did not intend to reside permanently with the applicant was certainly open to be made on the basis of that evidence.
