The determinative issue in this application is whether the interpretation provided before the RPD met the appropriate standard. Counsel agree that, as a matter of law, the interpretation must be continuous, precise, competent, impartial and contemporaneous. See: Mohammadian v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] 4 F.C. 85 (C.A.). This does not mean that perfection in interpretation is required. In Mohammadian, the Court of Appeal expressly adopted the comments of Chief Justice Lamer, as he then was, in R. v. Tran, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 951 at page 987, that interpretation is an "inherently human endeavour which often takes place in less than ideal circumstances".
