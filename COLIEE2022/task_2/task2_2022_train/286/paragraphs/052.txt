Subsection 24(2) raises different issues because it is not any information about an offender which is subject to correction in the manner contemplated by the subsection. Subsection 24(2) only covers information which the offender has been given access to pursuant to subsection 23(2) which in turn relates back to information obtained by the Service under subsection 23(1). The structure of section 23 and 24 of the
Act
signal the type of information contemplated for correction. It is profile information from which the Service can use to predict an offender's likely behaviour. The Commissioner acknowledged this DNA type information as at the root of the Service exercising "the option of increasing your security level based on a number of your history of violent offences, your record of escape and an evaluation of information identifying you as an escape risk".
