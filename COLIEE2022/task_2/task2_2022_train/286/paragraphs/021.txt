On January 6, 1998, the Citizen's Advisory Committee (CAC) reported to the Warden at Kingston Penitentiary as follows:
"This Committee also notes that the offender was found not guilty of assaulting another offender ...
The Committee recommends that this assault information be removed or purged from the offender's file.
"The Committee also recommends that Mr. B. Wheeler, CCM meet with Mr. Tehrankari to
provide some evidence and explanation with respect to the reliability of the attempt escape information from Warkworth Institution
." (emphasis mine)
