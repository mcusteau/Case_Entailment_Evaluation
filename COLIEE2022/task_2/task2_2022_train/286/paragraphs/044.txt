To conclude on this point, I would apply a correctness standard if the question involved is the proper interpretation of section 24 of the
Act
; however, I would apply the standard of reasonableness simpliciter if the question involved is either the application of proper legal principles to the facts or whether the refusal decision to correct information on the offender's file was proper. The patently unreasonable standard applies to pure findings of fact. (Subsection 18.2(4) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7.)
