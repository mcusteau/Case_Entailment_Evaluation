This proceeding as well as the grievances below were handled by the applicant personally, without legal counsel's assistance. New and different issues arose throughout the grievance proceedings which changed the course of the applicant's original purpose to obtain file corrections on information in the CSC files he believed contained errors and omissions. For example, at the level two grievance stage, the applicant sought the identity of the person who provided information that led his CMO to conclude he was planning to escape from Warkworth. Another example is his second level grievance demand for an explanation why the prison guards missed the Discipline Court hearing and why the guard observation reports were not given to the O.P.P.
