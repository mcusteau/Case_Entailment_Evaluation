This type of basic behavioral predictor type information has nothing to do with information the Service obtains on what an offender actually does or did inside the prison walls. Parliament, through other provisions of the
Act
, selected other methods of testing the accuracy of an offender's actions while incarcerated or otherwise. A review of sections 27 through 45 of the
Act
makes this evident. For example, in terms of disclosure, an opportunity is provided to make representations and discipline court hearings are mandated with appropriate limitations both statutory and at common law to reflect the realities of the prison context and to ensure discipline is applied in an expeditious and effective manner.
