The applicant's arguments on third level appeal were similar to the ones previously put forward and his appeal was dismissed by the Commissioner on July 23, 1998 in these terms:
"1. The issue of availability of witnesses, or the provision of documents is not relevant to your case. I acknowledge that you were found 'not guilty'. I should point out, however, that the information contained in the preventive security reports is
still relevant for administrative decision-making even though there was insufficient evidence to register a conviction in disciplinary court
.
"2. You were notified of the reasons for your placement in segregation. Segregation reviews were conducted at the appropriate intervals. I regret the delay in preparing the Security Information Report, however, I find no evidence to indicate that you suffered any hardship as a result of this delay.
"3. You were found 'not guilty' and no sanction was imposed.
The Service exercised the option of increasing your security level based on a number of factors including your history of violent offences, your record of escape, and an evaluation of information identifying you as an escape risk
.
"4. You have been provided with the gist of the information contained in the SIR. The release of any further information might jeopardize the safety of other individuals. In accordance with Section 27(3) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act, no further details will be provided to you.
"5. The Preventive Security information is considered valid and
will remain
on your file. Please be assured that your opposition to its inclusion in your file has been recorded, as required in Section 24 of the CCRA.
"I find that the responses that were provided to you at the previous levels were fair and thorough. Your grievance is denied." (emphasis mine)
