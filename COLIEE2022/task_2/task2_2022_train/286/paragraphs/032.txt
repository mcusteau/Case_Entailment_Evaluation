Any remedy flowing from this proceeding must take into account the prison context is a special one. For example, in
Cardinal and Oswald v. Kent Institution (Director)
, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643; 63 N.R. 353; [1986] 1 W.W.R. 577; 49 C.R.(3d) 35; 23 C.C.C.(3d) 118; 24 D.L.R.(4th) 44, Le Dain, J., pointed out the minimal or essential requirements of procedural fairness in the circumstances must be "fully compatible with the concern that the process of prison administration, because of its special nature and exigencies, should not be unduly burdened or obstructed by the imposition of unreasonable or inappropriate procedural requirements. There is nothing to suggest that the requirement of notice and hearing by the Director, where he does not intend to act in accordance with a recommendation by the Segregation Review Board for the release of an inmate from segregation, would impose an undue burden on prison administration or create a risk to security" (see page 660). My colleague Nadon, J., in
Cartier v. Canada (Procureur général)
(1998), 165 F.T.R. 209 (T.D.), expressed the same caution about the special prison context when interpreting the scope of subsection 27(3) of the
Act
which provides for certain information not to be disclosed where the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that disclosure of the information would jeopardize the safety of any person or the security of the penitentiary.
