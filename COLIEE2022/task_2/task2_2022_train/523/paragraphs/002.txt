The plaintiff says that the counterclaim should not be proceeded with in this court, relying on clause 27 of the Bill of Lading which provides:
"27. Law and Jurisdiction
Whenever the '
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act
1936' (
COGSA
) of the United States of America applies by virtue of clause 5.2 above this contract is to be governed by United States law and the United States Federal Court Southern District of New York is to have exclusive jurisdiction to hear all disputes hereunder. In all other cases this Bill of Lading is subject to English law and jurisdiction."
Counsel for the plaintiff says that
COGSA
is not applicable and therefore the Bill of Lading is subject to English law and jurisdiction. He says the defendant should bring its counterclaim in England.
