Counsel for the plaintiff acknowledges that this court has jurisdiction to hear and decide the counterclaim, but should only interfere with the contractual agreement between the parties as to jurisdiction where strong reasons are shown. He relies on
Corostel Trading Ltd. v. Secunda Marine Services Ltd. et al.
(1990), 38 F.T.R. 232 (T.D.) and
The Ship M/V Seapearl of Cyprus Registry et al. v. Seven Seas Dry Cargo Shipping Corporation of Santiago, Chile
, [1983] 2 F.C. 161; 43 N.R. 517 (F.C.A.). In
The Seapearl
, Pratte, J.A., states at page 176-177:
"Contractual undertakings whereby parties agree to submit their disputes to a foreign court or to arbitration do not deprive the Federal Court of its jurisdiction. However, when proceedings are commenced in defiance of such an undertaking the court has the discretion to order that the proceedings be stayed. Section 50(1)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
confers on the court the discretionary power to stay proceedings where 'it is in the interest of justice that the proceedings be stayed'. As a rule, it is certainly in the interest of justice that contractual undertakings be honoured.
. . . . .
"Prima facie, an application to stay proceedings commenced in the Federal Court in defiance of an undertaking to submit a dispute to arbitration or to a foreign court must succeed because, as a rule, contractual undertakings must be honoured. In order to depart from the prima facie rule, 'strong reasons' are needed, that is to say reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion that it would not be reasonable or just, in the circumstances, to keep the plaintiff to his promise and enforce the contract he made with the defendant. This is the principle which is now applied in England and in the United States; that is also, in my opinion, the principle that should be applied in this court." (footnotes omitted)
