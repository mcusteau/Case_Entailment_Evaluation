The plaintiff is a New Jersey corporation with its head office at Madison, New Jersey. Plaintiff's counsel does not deny that the defendant is entitled to ask for security of costs. The only matter in dispute is the amount. Both parties agree that the costs are referable only to the plaintiff's claim, although defendant's counsel submits some issues on the counterclaim will be identical to those in the plaintiff's claim. I agree with both counsel that security for costs should be referable to the plaintiff's claim and, based upon submissions for both parties, fix the amount at $3,000. The amount may be paid into court or, if agreeable to counsel for the defendant, may be held by plaintiff's counsel in his trust account.
