A similar situation arose in
Vallorbe Shipping Co. v. S.A. v. The Ship M.V. Tropwave
, [1975] F.C. 595 (T.D.). At page 600-601, Heald, J. (as he then was), in deciding not to stay proceedings in this court, stated:
"In the case at bar, the plaintiff by bringing this action, clearly expressed its intention to revoke the arbitration clause and the defendant, by filing its statement of defence and counterclaim, has also clearly expressed a similar intention (a circumstance which was not present in the
Normandin Lumber
case, supra. Thus, the plaintiff in November of 1974 and Canadian Transport in December of 1974, took actions which clearly indicated the intention of each to pursue its remedy in the Federal Court. Normally, that would be conclusive of the matter.

"However, because both parties have submitted to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court and because at least some of the issues of fact arose in Canada, and because the claims of both parties are secured in Canada within the jurisdiction of this court, I have concluded, on the facts of this case as presented to me, that it would not be in the interests of justice to stay the proceedings herein."
