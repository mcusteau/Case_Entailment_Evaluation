The House of Lords analyzed an important statement of the principle of legitimate expectation in
Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service
, [1984] 3 All E.R. 935; 62 N.R. 336; [1985] 1 A.C. 374. That case concerned a government order prohibiting members of the Civil Service working in the communications headquarters, an important location for national security, from engaging in any union activity. The employees had been unionized since 1947 and the union was consulted on any important change affecting working conditions. The House of Lords upheld the applicants' argument that they had a legitimate expectation to be consulted before the order in question was made.
