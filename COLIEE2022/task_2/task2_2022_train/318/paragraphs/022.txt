[22]
By his alternative submission in the matter the plaintiff argued that the existing policy was a quasi-regulation. According to precedent the exercise of such a discretionary power imposes a duty to act fairly. Apart from exceptional circumstances, the plaintiff acquired a right according to the principle of legitimate expectation. From the conversation he said he had with his immediate superior suggesting that "if everything went as expected" the plaintiff could expect to be hired permanently he could also anticipate that this promise would be fulfilled and that the policy would be uniformly and consistently applied. Counsel for the plaintiff therefore submitted that there was an abuse of discretion in the case at bar.
