Counsel submitted that the reasons for the nonrenewal of Mr. Girard's term in December 1985 were the following:
1. a reorganization by the Department of its permanent staff due to a rationalization of resources;
2. a proposed cut in person-years;
3. a strike occurring in an abattoir near that of the plaintiff.
He stated that in March 1985 the Department knew that a reorganization of its permanent staff had to be undertaken on account of the closure of an abattoir and a surplus of two persons in the fields of poultry farming and dairy products. In November 1985 the national authorities of the Department notified Qu√©bec managers that it was necessary to deduct 11.75 person-years from the staff of the Agricultural Inspection Division before the 1986 fiscal year. These cuts made a number of permanent employees vulnerable and the Department had a duty to protect them. Further, the strike which occurred at the Saint-Henri abattoir on December 8, 1985, prevented the Department's two permanent employees from doing their work. They accordingly had to be reassigned to the closest abattoir, the one where the plaintiff was working.
