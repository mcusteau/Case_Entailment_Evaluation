In May 1989 the Department offered the plaintiff a choice between two positions, a PI-03 full-time position at Saint-Hyacinthe and another part-time position at Notre-Dame-du-Lac. The plaintiff took the full-time position subject to certain conditions. He asked for compensation for the trouble and loss of salary resulting from the Department's refusal to renew his contract. The Department rejected these conditions as it found them unacceptable.
