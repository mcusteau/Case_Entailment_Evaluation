  In the instant case, a review of the documentary evidence does not support the applicant's allegation that there is substantial evidence to show that all MDC members are in great danger at the hands of ZANU-PF. As noted earlier in these reasons, the documentary evidence does mention certain incidents of violence against persons with a much higher political profile than that of the applicant. Excepting the applicant's evidence which was determined to be non-credible, there is no other credible evidence which would allow a Board to conclude that the applicant is a person in need of protection under the provisions of section 97 of the Act.
