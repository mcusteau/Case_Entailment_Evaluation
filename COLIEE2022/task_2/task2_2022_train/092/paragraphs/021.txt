  The Board determined the applicant's section 96 claim on a negative credibility finding. The Board did not believe her story and did not accept that she had a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the ZANU-PF based on her political opinion. A "person in need of protection", as set out in s. 97 of the Act, is a person whose removal would subject her personally to "a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture..." or to a "risk to [her] life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment...". A negative credibility determination which may be determinative of a refugee claim under s. 96 of the Act is not necessarily determinative of a claim under subsection 97(1) of the Act. The elements required to establish a claim under section 97 differ from those required under section 96 of the Act, where a well-founded fear of persecution to a Convention ground must be satisfied. Although the evidentiary basis, may well be the same for both claims, it is essential that both claims be considered as separate. A claim under section 97 of the Act requires that the Board apply a different test, namely whether a claimant's removal would subject that individual personally to the dangers and risks stipulated in paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. Whether a Board properly considered both claims is a matter to be determined in the circumstances of each individual case bearing in mind the different elements required to establish each claim.
