On September 10, 2001, she received a telephone call at work from a person who told her "we are going to get you" and "we know where you are". She was followed on that day and during the following week. On September 16, 2001, she went to her parents' house in Bulawayo, located 300 miles away. On September 18, 2001, someone banged on the gate of her parents' house and she received another threatening call at the house. The applicant left Zimbabwe for Canada, in fear for her life.
