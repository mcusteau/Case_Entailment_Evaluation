  The applicant argues that the Board made three errors in its consideration of the facts. First, by rejecting the applicant's allegation of being threatened by members of ZANU-PF on the basis that she did not do anything that would have brought such a response from the said members. In so doing, the applicant contends that the Board failed to consider documentary evidence which corroborated her claim, including a letter from her mother which confirmed that threatening calls are still being made by the agents of persecution. Second, by finding implausible the call received by the applicant after the civic election, accusing her of convincing people to vote for MDC and threatening to harm her when she had stated that there were no voting irregularities. And third, by finding implausible that the ZANU-PF would go to such lengths merely to scare her if they were interested in harming her.
