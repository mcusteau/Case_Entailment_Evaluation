  Whether the omission of a separate section 97 analysis amounts to a reviewable error depends on the particular circumstances of each case ( 
 Kandiah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 181, at para. 16). Where no claims have been made or evidence adduced that would warrant such a separate analysis, it will not be required ( 
 Brovina 
   
 v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2004 FC 635, at paras. 17-18).
