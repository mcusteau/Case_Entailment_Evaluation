 [3] 
  The Applicants seek to have the decision set aside on the basis that the RPD erred by: 
 
 
 
 i. rejecting their claims solely on the basis that they lacked a subjective fear of persecution or a risk contemplated by section 97 of the IRPA; 
 
 
 
 ii. ignoring and misapprehending important evidence; 
 
 
 
 iii. breaching the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice by specifically identifying only two issues towards the end of its hearing and then basing its decision on other issues that had been implicitly excluded; and 
 
 
 
 iv. failing to conduct a separate analysis under section 97.
