  Ms. Velez then began noticing that a particular car was parked near her workplace or her home, and that it would follow her as she walked home from work. She claims to have reported this to the police, who told her to write down the license plate number and to take a picture of the car, if possible. After attempting to follow these instructions, she received a call from a man who identified himself as Simon and who claimed to be a member of the FARC. She asserts that he told her that if she took down the license plate number of the car in question, she "would not live to tell the story." He apparently added that the FARC would force her to provide the list of persons with large investments in the co-operative if she did not voluntarily comply. She claims that he also stated that if she did not cooperate she would be declared a military target and that she would see how nice she looked in a camouflaged uniform. She did not report this incident to the police.
