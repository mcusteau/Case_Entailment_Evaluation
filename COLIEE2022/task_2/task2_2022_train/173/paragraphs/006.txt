  In December 1998, while employed as an administrator at a credit and savings co-operative, she once again began to receive telephone calls from representatives of the FARC. On these occasions, she was requested to provide assistance in integrating guerrilla members into the co-operative. After she refused these requests, she claims that she began to receive threatening telephone calls at home, in which she was told that she "would regret it dearly" if she did not comply with the callers' demands. In February 1999, during another wave of these types of telephone calls, she claims that she was told that nothing was impossible for the FARC, that they knew her routine and that they knew she lived with her sister. She informed her boss about these calls, but was told there was nothing he could do to help her.
