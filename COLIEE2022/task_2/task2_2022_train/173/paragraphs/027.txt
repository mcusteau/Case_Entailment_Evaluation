  In my view, it is clear from these passages of the RPD's decision that it did not, in fact, reject the Applicants' claims solely on the basis of their lack of subjective fear of persecution or a risk contemplated by section 97. The above-described conclusions, together with the RPD's finding that the Applicants' failure to legalize their status in the United States for over eight years was not consistent with their stated fears, notwithstanding their explanations, provided sufficient support for the RPD's rejection of the Applicants' claims pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA.
