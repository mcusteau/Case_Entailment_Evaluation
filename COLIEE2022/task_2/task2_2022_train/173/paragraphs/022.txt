  In my view, the RPD ought to be accorded deference with respect to whether it deals with claims made under both sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA separately or in a single integrated analysis, particularly given (i) the RPD's substantial expertise with respect to the issues that are raised in claims made under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA, and (ii) the nature of the issues raised when claims are made under both of those sections is such that it is often not necessary to conduct a separate analysis under each of these sections, especially where credibility or the adequacy of state protection is a determinative issue ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , above, at paras. 55, 56, 64 and 66;  
 Khosa 
 , above, at para. 44). In this context, a failure to accord some deference to the RPD in this regard would not be consistent with the view that the concept of deference is "central to judicial review in administrative law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , above, at para. 48).
