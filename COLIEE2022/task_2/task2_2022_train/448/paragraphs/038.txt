The critical date for assessing obviousness is the claimed date of the invention. The '080 patent claims priority from three Japanese patent applications. The respondent submits that the applicant has not led evidence to establish the date of invention; therefore, the relevant date for evaluating obviousness must be taken as being no earlier than the earliest possible priority date, one year prior to the Canadian patent application, June 20, 1985. The applicant conceded this at the hearing and I accept that this is the correct date in light of sections 28 and 29 of the
Patent Act
as it read prior to October 1, 1989.
