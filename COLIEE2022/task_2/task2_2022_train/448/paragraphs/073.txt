Relevant to this issue is the unsatisfactory manner in which Janssen's expert, Dr. Schroeder, performed his search for the Gerster flumequine references. These references, cited by Novopharm as prior art in its NOA, dealt with the likelihood of better properties in racemic flumequine existing on the (-) enantiomer. The claimed inability of Schroeder to find these prior art references is relevant to whether a person skilled in the art could have predicted that it would be the (-) enantiomer of ofloxacin that would be responsible for the antimicrobial activity of the racemate.
