Dr. Caldwell's evidence is that the tests to establish the beneficial properties of the S(-) enantiomer were entirely routine, uncomplicated, generally accepted well prior to 1985, and did not amount to any inventive step. While the exact antimicrobial, solubility and toxicity characteristics of levofloxacin could not have been predicted with absolute certainty without verification through testing, such characteristics would have been easily predictable or obvious to the skilled chemist with knowledge of enantiomers and stereochemistry, and could have been verified by using the routine analytical tests available to pharmaceutical chemists in 1984.
