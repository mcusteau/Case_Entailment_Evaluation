In my opinion, this is in line with the approach in patent law that a patentable discovery must involve some inventive ingenuity. The improvements contemplated on the already discovered racemic compound must demonstrate "sufficiently different" characteristics from what was already known in order for the patent not to be declared invalid for obviousness. This is just a different way of articulating the "special property" concept described by Fox, above, that a selection patent must possess in order to qualify for a new patent on the selection and description of an item from an already known group or series.
