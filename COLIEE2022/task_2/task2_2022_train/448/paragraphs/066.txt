Dr. Caldwell attests that the results of the testing on the optical isomers of racemic ofloxacin were not unexpected or surprising, given that the state of the scientific knowledge at the time was such that it was known that racemic compounds with certain attributes usually result from one of the enantiomers having quantitatively or qualitatively different biological activity from the racemic compound or the other enantiomer.
