It is well-established that the legal burden of proving that the second person's allegations are not justified is on the person seeking the prohibition order, namely Janssen-Ortho. Janssen-Ortho must establish, on a balance of probabilities, that Novopharm's allegations are not justified. While Janssen-Ortho bears the overall legal burden, Novopharm has the evidential burden to put "in play" the allegations set out in its NOA and its detailed statement: see
Merck Frosst Canada Inc. et al. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(1994), 169 N.R. 342; 55 C.P.R.(3d) 302 (F.C.A.);
Pharmacia Inc. et al. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(1995), 92 F.T.R. 253; 60 C.P.R.(3d) 328 (T.D.), affd. (1995), 191 N.R. 157; 64 C.P.R.(3d) 450 (F.C.A.), and
Bayer Inc. et al. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(2000), 258 N.R. 238; 6 C.P.R.(4th) 285 (F.C.A.). The facts contained in the NOA and detailed statement are presumed to be true, at least with respect to allegations of non-infringement, except to the extent that the contrary has been shown by the applicant: see
