Turning to the solubility properties noted in the '080 patent, Dr. Klibanov attests that the 1976 Repta article indicates that it is not possible to predict which isomer of the two would be more efficacious with respect to solubility, or whether either isomer will be more soluble than its racemate. Dr. Caldwell refers to the findings set out in the Repta article which disclose that the solubility of pure enantiomers is several times greater than that of the corresponding racemates.
