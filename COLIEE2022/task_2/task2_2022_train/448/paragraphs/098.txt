Dr. Caldwell stated as follows at paragraph 41 of his affidavit:
"Using the analogy that the disclosure of (+/-) ofloxacin can be likened to disclosure of a pair of gloves (i.e., left and right gloves), the above statement that an 'S(-) ... compound' would not be used to describe racemic ofloxcacin, is akin to saying that the term 'a left glove' would not be used ... to describe a pair of gloves. However, this does not address the essential fact that the S(-) compound sought to be claimed in CA '080 is disclosed in CA '840 and Osada et al."
