Mosley, J.
: Janssen-Ortho Inc., and Daiichi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., seek an order to prohibit the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Novopharm Limited, regarding the marketing of tablets of an antimicrobial drug known generically as "levofloxacin" until after the expiry of Daiichi's levofloxacin patent. Janssen-Ortho is licensed by Daiichi to sell the drug in Canada under the brand name LEVAQUIN. Novopharm alleges that the patent is invalid for lack of novelty, obviousness, ambiguity, overbreadth and insufficiency of specification. Novopharm further asserts that its version of levofloxacin would not in any event infringe any of the patent's claims. The substantive issue in these proceedings is whether Novopharm's allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the patent are justified.
