In my view, in the case at hand, such reasoning is applicable, but to bring about the opposite result. The beneficial properties discovered and set out in the '080 patent were not unknown. They were the same beneficial properties found in ofloxacin, only to a greater degree of effectiveness. Further, I find that knowledge of the existence of and the possibility of separating the two enantiomers of ofloxacin was common to the ordinary chemist, and the determination of which enantiomer possessed a greater amount of the same benefits of the previously known racemic antibiotic was not surprising or inventive. This determination was made from one of three possibilities, not a great number of possibilities; that is, either the S(-) enantiomer, R (+) enantiomer or the racemate would exhibit better qualities, in comparison to each other, relating to the properties of antimicrobial activity, toxicity or solubility.
