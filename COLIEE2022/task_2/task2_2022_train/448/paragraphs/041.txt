Counsel for Janssen takes issue with the fact that Novopharm has not established how the cited references were located or how any of the references would have been reasonably located without the benefit of hindsight. In particular, Janssen refers to the two 1982 Gerster references which one of its affiants, Dr. Hans Schroeder, could not locate in any Canadian library, despite about two days of searching. Since Novopharm has not put forward any evidence suggesting how these references could be or were obtained, the applicant argues that they are not valid prior art references.
