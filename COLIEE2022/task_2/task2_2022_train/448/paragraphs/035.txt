The commonly accepted test for obviousness was set out in
Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet Oy
(1986), 64 N.R. 287; 8 C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A.), by Hugessen, J.A., as follows at page 294 [C.P.R.]:
"The test for obviousness is not to ask what competent inventors did or would have done to solve the problem. Inventors are by definition inventive. The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right.
The question to be asked is whether this mythical creature
(the man in the Clapham omnibus of patent law)
would, in the light of the state of the art and of common general knowledge as at the claimed date of invention, have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the patent. It is a very difficult test to satisfy
