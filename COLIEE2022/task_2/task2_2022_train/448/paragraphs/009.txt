Ofloxacin is a racemic compound, that is a substance containing equal amounts of two optical isomers. An isomer is one of a number of molecules that have the same constituent atoms; however, the bonds between the atoms are oriented differently in space. Their optical quality refers to their ability to rotate the plane of polarized light, that is, light focussed to shine only in one direction. Optical isomers that rotate polarized light to the right, in a clockwise direction, are "dextrorotatory" and use the symbols (+) or (d) for "dextro". Optical isomers that rotate polarized right to the left, in a counter-clockwise direction, are "levorotatory" and use the symbols (-) or (l) for "levo". The drug at issue here is the S(-) optical isomer of ofloxacin, hence "levofloxacin".
