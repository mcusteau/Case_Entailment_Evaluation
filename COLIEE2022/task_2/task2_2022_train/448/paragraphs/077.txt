Even if I were to find that the Gerster references dealing with flumequine are not valid prior art references, this would not affect my conclusion that the general state of knowledge for chemists in the field of stereoisomers in 1984 would have included the common understanding that one of the enantiomers of ofloxacin would likely exhibit higher antimicrobial activity. Therefore, verifying which enantiomer possessed this quality - and to what degree in comparison to the racemate and the other optical isomer - did not involve the exercise of any inventive step.
