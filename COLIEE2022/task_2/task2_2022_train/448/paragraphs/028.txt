In my view, the claims of the '080 patent would be read by a person skilled in the art as referring to the levorotatory isomer of ofloxacin and not to racemic ofloxacin. In claims 1, 2 and 10 of the '080 patent the phrase "S(-) ... compound" is employed, as are solid-coloured wedges in the graphical depictions of the formulas for the compounds in the claims. The use of the "S" and "(-)" symbols and the solid-coloured wedges designates, from what the expert affidavit evidence has revealed in this proceeding, an optically active isomer with an "S" configuration rotating the plane of polarized light in a counter-clockwise direction. Racemic ofloxacin would not be described using the S(-) prefix. Moreover, the specification of the '080 patent confirms this construction of the claims. The disclosure refers to "optically active compounds of Ofloxacin" or the "racemic Ofloxacin" in contrast to the description of the S(-) enantiomer.
