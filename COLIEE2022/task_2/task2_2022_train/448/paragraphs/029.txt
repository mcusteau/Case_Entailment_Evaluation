Having reviewed the claims with the aid of the expert evidence in this proceeding, I am satisfied that the patent disclosure must form part of the construction to give the Court an understanding of the meaning behind the chemical formulae in the claims. This disclosure indicates that the antimicrobial activity of the optical (-) and (+) isomers of ofloxacin against various microorganisms was compared to that of the ofloxacin racemate. This demonstrates, in my view, that discovery of the beneficial properties in the S(-) optical isomer was the object and usefulness of this patent.
