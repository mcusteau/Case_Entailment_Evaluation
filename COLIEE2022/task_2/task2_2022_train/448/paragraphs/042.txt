Novopharm maintains that the Gerster references were publicly available in 1982. Both relate to a paper Gerster presented at a 1982 Toronto four-day symposium sponsored by three major professional societies. One of these references was subsequently cited in the list of references in a 1985 article in the
Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy
and also in the list of references of U.S. Patent No. 5,053,407.
