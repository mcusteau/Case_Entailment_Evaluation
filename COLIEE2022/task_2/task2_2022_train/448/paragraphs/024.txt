Claim construction remains, in the end, a question of law for the Court to decide:
Whirlpool
, supra, and
Procter & Gamble Co. v. Beecham Canada Ltd. and Calgon Interamerican Corp.
(1982), 40 N.R. 313; 61 C.P.R.(2d) 1 (F.C.A.). The key to purposive construction, as articulated by Justice Binnie in
Whirlpool
, supra, is for the Court to identify the particular words or phrases in the patent claims that describe what the inventor considered to be the "essential elements of his invention" (para. 45).
