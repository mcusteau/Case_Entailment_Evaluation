I recognize that while Repta et al. noted that the optically active compounds had been known to have one enantiomer exhibiting a different biological activity than the racemate, the results that were actually found in this study were, at page 241 of the article, that the "antitumor activity for each enantiomer was equivalent to that of the (±)-I. Therefore any pharmaceutical advantage to be realized from the use of an enantiomer could only arise from its significantly greater solubility relative to (±)-I." The Repta article then described the findings of the increased solubility of the individual enantiomers relative to the racemate.
