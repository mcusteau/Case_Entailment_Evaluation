Novopharm further alleges that the claims in the patent are both ambiguous and broader than the invention since they fail to include any "purity limitation" covering compositions which include the S(-) enantiomer mixed with other components, including the R(+) enantiomer. Novopharm therefore argues that the claims in the '080 patent are broader than the invention disclosed in the patent, since the '080 claims can cover any compound containing levofloxacin molecules, including the prior art of racemic ofloxacin (set out in the prior '840 patent), being an equal mixture of S(-) ofloxacin and R(+) ofloxacin, and the claims are invalid on this ground.
