I accept Dr. Caldwell's evidence that the techniques for isolating and verifying optical isomers were generally known and appear to have been understood and used by chemists in the early 1980s. The prior art Dr. Caldwell describes, including several patents published prior to the date of invention that detail the particular benefits of enantiomers isolated from other racemic antibiotics, also demonstrates that synthesizing individual enantiomers from racemic compounds was not the "extremely difficult" proposition maintained at one point by Dr. Klibanov. In fact, Dr. Klibanov recognized that, while making optical isomers with high optical purity was difficult, there were "various techniques known at that [the early 1980s] time" to undertake the process.
