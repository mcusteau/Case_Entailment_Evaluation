[84]
As mentioned, I accept Dr. Caldwell's evidence that the properties described in the '080 patent concerning the levorotatory isomer of ofloxacin were not unexpected or surprisingly superior to what had already been disclosed with respect to ofloxacin. Based on the prior art of Repta et al., the Gerster references, the '840 patent disclosing ofloxacin as racemic with particular beneficial properties, and the U.S. patents cited dealing with other racemic compounds similar in structure to ofloxacin [see footnote 3], such "discovery" would have been obvious to the ordinary skilled chemist, knowing the state of the art of stereoisomers in 1985.
