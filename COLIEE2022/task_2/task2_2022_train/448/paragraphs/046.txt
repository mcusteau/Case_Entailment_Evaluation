(2002), 291 N.R. 168; 21 C.P.R.(4th) 129 (F.C.A.), where the prior art disclosed that the drug could be formulated by conventional methods, and that "mechanical skill" rather than inventive genius was required in order to arrive at the claims in the impugned patent; the "improvements" noted in the patent's disclosure merely verified the properties of a known substance formulated using common techniques.
