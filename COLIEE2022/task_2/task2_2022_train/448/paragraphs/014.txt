Janssen-Ortho accepts that with respect to infringement, the legal burden is clearly its own. However, with respect to validity, the applicant submits that the burden of proof in a NOC proceeding shifts to the respondent due to the presumption that the patent is valid pursuant to section 45 of the pre-1989
Patent Act
. The parties agree that as the application for the '080 patent was made in 1986, the
Patent Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4 applies.
