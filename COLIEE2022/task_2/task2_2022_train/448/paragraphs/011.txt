When produced, levofloxacin was discovered to possess beneficial properties over both racemic ofloxacin and the R(+) optical isomer. The specification of the '080 patent, under the heading "Background of the Invention" at pages 1-2, discloses the beneficial properties of the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin (levofloxacin) in contrast to the racemic ofloxacin and the R(+) compound, as follows:
"... The present inventors obtained optically active compounds of the racemic Ofloxacin and found that the S(-)-compound possesses an antimicrobial activity of about 2 times higher than that of the (±)-compound and acute toxicity LD50 weaker than that of the (±)-compound as determined in mice by intravenous administration. On the other hand, the present inventors found that the R(+)-compound exhibits an antimicrobial activity of only about 1/10 to 1/100 times that of the (±)-compound, whereas it possess an acute toxicity substantially equal to that of the (±)-compound. That is, the S(-)-form of Ofloxacin has been found to have very desirable properties, i.e., increased antimicrobial activity and reduced toxicity, and is expected to be a very useful pharmaceutical agents [sic] as compared with the (±)-compound. Further, both the R(+)- and S(-)-compounds of Ofloxacin in the free form have markedly high water-solubility as compared with the (±)-compound and as compared with free compounds of this type, and can be used as injectable preparations. These advantages will be apparent from the experimental data shown hereinafter."
