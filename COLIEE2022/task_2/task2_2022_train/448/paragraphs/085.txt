I am satisfied that Novopharm has established on a balance of probabilities that a technician skilled in the art would have come directly and without difficulty to the solution taught by the '080 patent by simply conducting known, routine experiments with racemic ofloxacin. I conclude that the claims set out in the '080 patent are obvious; what is claimed as the "discovery" or "invention" in the '080 patent does not suggest the scintilla of inventive ingenuity to qualify for the patent monopoly, but rather was the result of "mere verification" of the attributes of already known components of a compound.
