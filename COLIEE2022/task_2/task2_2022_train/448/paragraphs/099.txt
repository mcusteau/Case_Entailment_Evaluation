Novopharm submits that prior disclosure of a pair of gloves inherently discloses its constituent left and right-hand gloves, and claiming a valid patent simply by asserting the term "left glove" cannot be viewed as asserting a novel patent claim that was not anticipated by an earlier disclosure of the "pair of gloves". In determining whether the '080 patent claims are novel, Novopharm also argues that Janssen's expert has improperly "read in" to the claims a purity level or limitation from the disclosure of the patent. Novopharm submits that such reading in from the disclosure should not be permitted to expand the scope of the patent claims and make them novel.
