Dr. Caldwell's glove analogy only goes so far in dealing with compounds that require a particular isolation process that will allow a chemist to note the properties of each enantiomer. A pair of gloves is visible without requiring a process to produce such visibility. In the case of the '840 patent and '892 patents, there is no teaching of how to differentiate enantiomers of racemic ofloxacin, nor is there any indication from one definitive, prior art source that either enantiomer will have certain improved qualities over the other enantiomer or the racemate. Moreover, the Osada reference does not disclose these teachings.
