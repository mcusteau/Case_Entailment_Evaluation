The respondent's situation is not analogous to that of a student who will return home after a temporary period abroad. Nothing, except for the passive indicia identified by the Citizenship Judge (income tax returns, property leases and a few bank statements), demonstrates that the respondent's life was centralized in Canada: in fact, in the last two years he has spent only 88 days here. The evidence establishes a travel pattern that can be characterized as returning to Canada occasionally to visit his family.
