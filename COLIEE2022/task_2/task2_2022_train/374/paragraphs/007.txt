In the case of
Sheikh
[see footnote 1], the Federal Court of Appeal emphasized the distinction between the concepts of "credibility" and "credible evidence". MacGuigan, J.A., writing for the Court, stated that a tribunal's finding that the claimant is not a credible witness may amount to a finding of no credible evidence,
where the only evidence before the tribunal linking the claimant to his or her claim is that of the claimant him or herself
.
"The concept of 'credible evidence' is not, of course, the same as that of the credibility of the applicant, but it is obvious that where the only evidence before a tribunal linking the applicant to his claim is that of the applicant himself (in addition, perhaps, to "country reports" from which nothing about the applicant's claim can be directly deduced), a tribunal's perception that he is not a credible witness effectively amounts to a finding that there is no credible evidence on which the second-level tribunal could allow his claim.
"I would add that in my view, even without disbelieving every word an applicant has uttered, a first-level panel may reasonably find him so lacking in credibility that it concludes there is no credible evidence relevant to his claim on which a second-level panel could uphold that claim. In other words, a general finding of a lack of credibility on the part of the applicant may conceivably extend to all relevant evidence emanating from his testimony." [see footnote 2]
