The defendant submits that the Prothonotary erred by holding that for the adjusters' reports to be privileged, it was necessary for the defendant to introduce evidence that the adjusters intended to immediately (or even promptly) deliver the reports to counsel. I agree with the plaintiff's submission that this claim is based on a misreading of the Prothonotary's decision. In his affidavit, Mr. Woodall asserted that all his reports were prepared for the dominant purpose of litigation. On page 14 of his reasons for order, Hargrave, P., held that the evidence presented in the Woodall affidavit does not establish that the dominant purpose for which the reports were prepared was to instruct counsel, and noted that one could infer from the affidavit that Mr. Woodall was not aware that counsel had been appointed before he prepared the fourth and final report. The Prothonotary did not hold that a requirement for privilege to attach to the adjuster's reports was that the adjuster intend to immediately deliver the reports to counsel. In my view, the test for privilege set out by the Prothonotary is consistent with the decision of the House of Lords in
Waugh v. British Railways Board
: the dominant purpose for which the relevant document is prepared must be that of submission to the legal adviser in view of litigation. (
Waugh v. British Railways Board
, [1980] A.C. 521 at 533 (H.L.) per Lord Wilberforce.)
