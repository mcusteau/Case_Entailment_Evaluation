I do not accept this line of argument. Firstly, there is no evidence to support the defendant's statement that the only two possible purposes for an adjuster's appointment in this case were to determine insurance coverage or defend anticipated claims. As noted by the Prothonotary, the defendant failed to provide specific evidence as to the particular reasons behind the appointment of the adjusters by the defendant's insurer. Furthermore, there is no support in the authorities for a distinction between the test for privilege applied to plaintiffs' reports as opposed to defendants' reports. In
Bhadrachalam Paperboards Ltd. v. Ship Philippine Victory et al.
(1991), 49 F.T.R. 211 (T.D.), at 212, Teitelbaum, J., found that survey reports prepared on behalf of the defendants in a cargo claim were not privileged because they had been prepared "in the 'ordinary course' of cargo damage claims." (See also
Marubeni Corp. et al. v. Gearbulk Ltd., Ludwig (J.) Mowinckels Rederi A/S and Ship Hoerda
(1986), 4 F.T.R. 265 (T.D.).) In so finding, Teitelbaum, J., applied the test for privilege laid out in
Canadian National Railway Co. v. McPhail's Equipment Co.
(1977), 16 N.R. 295 (F.C.A.):
"I am satisfied that the parties to these proceedings must produce their survey reports unless a party refusing to do so, can, and the onus is on that party, show that the said report was privileged, that is, it was prepared 'for the purpose of being laid before a solicitor or counsel for the purpose of obtaining his advice or enabling him to prosecute or defend an action or prepare a brief; and for the purpose of litigations existing or in contemplation at the time'. Furthermore, it is 'only after all attempts at settlement have failed could it be said that there was a "reasonable expectation of litigation"'..."
I therefore reject the contention that, on the basis of the evidence which was before the Prothonotary, the only purpose for which the reports could have been prepared was litigation.
