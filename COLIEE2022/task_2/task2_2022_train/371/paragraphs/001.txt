Rouleau, J.
: On October 18, 1995, the defendant filed a motion for an Order granting leave to Michael Kichuk, who is not a barrister and solicitor, to act on behalf of the Corporate defendant Source Personnel Inc. as provided in rule 300(2) of the
Federal Court Rules
. The grounds for the motion were that Michael Kichuk, an officer and director of the corporate defendant, is familiar with the
Rules
and Order of this Honourable Court and does not have sufficient cash flow to fund a solicitor to act for the corporation prior to trial.
