On Monday the 23rd day of October, 1995, Peter A.K. Giles, Associate Senior Prothonotary, granted leave to Michael Kichuk to represent the Corporate defendant Source Personnel Inc. in this court on the understanding that he should not give evidence and that he will undertake to be responsible for any costs which may be awarded against the defendant. In his decision, Mr. Giles stated that "the abbreviated unchallenged balance sheet submitted subject to confidentiality order indicates that at September 30th, the defendant could not readily retain lawyers".
