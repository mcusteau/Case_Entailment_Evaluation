The defendant has to have shown that not only was the Corporation impecunious, but so too was its principal shareholder. As to the impecuniosity of the Corporation, the abbreviated balance sheet in question does not provide sufficient detail as to the financial status of the Corporation and cannot be relied upon to reach the conclusion that counsel could not be retained.
Kurzela et al.
v.
526442 Ontario Ltd. and Canada Trust Co.
(1989), 31 O.A.C. 303; 66 O.R.(2d) 446, at p. 447 (Div. Ct.), dealt with the issue of the financial status of a principal shareholder of a corporation as follows:
"... once it is established that the corporate claimant has insufficient assets, the onus then shifts to the claimant to show that money may not be available to it from the shareholder or shareholders of the company, to fund the action and to post security for costs, as the courts have repeatedly held."
No evidence was adduced as to the impecuniosity of the Corporation's shareholders. In addition, Mr. Giles' Order indicates that the defendant "did have some substance" when an undertaking was given to be responsible for any costs which may be awarded against the defendant. In short, there is no indication of the "special circumstances" necessary under rule 300(2) to allow Michael Kichuk to represent the defendant Corporation.
