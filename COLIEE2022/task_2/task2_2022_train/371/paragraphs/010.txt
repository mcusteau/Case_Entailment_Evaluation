The standard of review that applies on such an appeal has been well stated by Jerome, A.C.J., in
Astra Aktiebolag et al. v. Aastra Corp. et al.
(1994), 90 F.T.R. 172; 59 C.P.R.(3d) 340 (T.D.):
"While rule 336(5) grants the right of appeal from such a decision or order of a prothonotary, it is markedly silent on the standard of review to be applied. In
R. v. Aqua-Gem Investments Ltd.
, [1993] 2 F.C. 425 (F.C.A.), at pp. 463-464, MacGuigan, J.A., set out the applicable standard of review as follows:
'I also agree with the Chief Justice in part as to the standard of review to be applied to a discretionary decision of a prothonotary. Following in particular Lord Wright in
Evans v. Bartlam
, [1937] A.C. 473 (H.L.), at p. 484, and Lacourci√®re, J.A., in
Stoicevski v. Casement
(1983), 43 O.R.(2d) 463 (Div. Ct.), discretionary orders of prothonotaries ought not be disturbed on appeal to a judge unless:
"(a) they are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts, or
"(b) they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case."
'Where such discretionary orders are clearly wrong in that the prothonotary has fallen into error of law (a concept in which I include a discretion based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts), or where they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case, a judge ought to exercise his own discretion de novo.'"
