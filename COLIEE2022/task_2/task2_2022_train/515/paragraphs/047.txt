[47]
For these reasons, this application for judicial review is allowed. The RPD's decision is quashed and the matter is referred back for re-determination by a differently constituted panel in a manner consistent with these reasons. More particularly, the RPD shall review the list of documents contained in the witness's immigration file and order production of only those documents that appear to contain information relating to the material misrepresentation which the respondent is alleged to have made. If the RPD is unable to assess whether a particular document may contain relevant information, it shall inspect the document first and then decide whether to order production.
