First, the scope of the RPD's power to compel evidence must be understood in a contextual manner (
Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Bankrupt), Re
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27; 221 N.R. 241; 106 O.A.C. 1). The RPD is not licensed to engage in an unrestricted search for truth. Rather, its power to compel evidence is limited by rule 39(2) of the Rules and subsection 4(b) of the
Inquiries Act
, under which the RPD can only compel evidence that it judges "necessary" or "requisite" to ensure a full and proper hearing. By virtue of wording of the
Inquiries Act
, moreover, the necessity of the evidence is tied directly to the scope of the hearing in question. [see footnote 3] And in the context of an application to vacate, the RPD is concerned with determining whether the protected person, indirectly or directly, made a material misrepresentation (see section 109 of the
Act
).
