It is plain that the respondent's daughter, the witness whose immigration file is at issue, has a privacy interest in the personal information contained therein. The applicant, moreover, pursuant to the
Privacy Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-21, section 8, has an obligation to ensure that confidential personal information is not disclosed unless in accordance with the legislation. [see footnote 2] Thus, if disclosure is allowed to occur, the privacy interest sought to be protected by the
Privacy Act
will be completely lost, which no subsequent remedy can undo.
