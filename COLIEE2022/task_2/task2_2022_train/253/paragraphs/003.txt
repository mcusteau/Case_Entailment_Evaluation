The applicants challenge the decision on the basis that two members heard the case and only one member made the decision. Section 69.1(7) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 ("the
Act
"), stipulates that two members constitute a quorum of the Tribunal for the purposes of a hearing into refugee claims. Section 69.1(8) provides that one member of the Tribunal may hear and determine a claim with the consent of the person seeking refugee status. The applicants never consented to a one member Tribunal.
