As I understand s. 63 and its interpretation by the Court of Appeal in
Weerasinge
, supra, the member who has resigned or otherwise ceased to hold office must have been rendered "unable to take part in the disposition" of the case or have died within the eight week period referred to in s. 63(1). In the event the member has become unable to take part in the disposition of the matter within the eight week period, a statement of the material circumstances explaining this inability should be placed on the record or be included in the reasons for decision.
