In this proceeding, Mr. Wakim explained his being the only member to sign the reasons in the following terms:
"Mike Douglas ceased to hold office as a Member of the Convention Refugee Determination Division on October 3, 1995. He participated in the disposition of the claim in accordance with section 63(1) of the
Act
. We discussed the reasons and the ultimate disposition. The Hearing Disposition Sheet was signed by both members. My colleague, Mr. Douglas, prepared the
summary of facts
, pertaining to the male claimant's oral testimony, which appear below. The remainder of the present reasons, written and signed by the remaining Member, reflect the thinking of the panel when the decision was made. Accordingly, the reasons signed by the remaining Member who heard the claim are deemed to be the reasons of the Refugee Division. [see footnote 5]"
The applicants characterize the Tribunal decision as one being made without the two member quorum required by s. 69.1(7).
