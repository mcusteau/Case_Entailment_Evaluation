  In the case at bar, the facts are distinguishable. The Director did not rely solely on the single fact of the commission of an offence described in the  
 IRPA 
 . Rather, she relied on the fact that Mr. Katwaru was convicted of manslaughter in connection with a child's death, after having been "warned of the consequences of shaking a baby." She further noted that "this did not stop him from continuing to abuse the baby." Earlier in her decision, she quoted additional aggravating circumstances that were identified by Justice LaForme in his Reasons for Sentence. Those circumstances included the fact that the case involved "systematic abuse that finally ended up with this tragic event of baby shaking death," as opposed to a single impulsive act. After describing the brutality of that systematic abuse, Justice LaForme called the offence "one of the most serious crimes under our laws against one of the most vulnerable members of our society."
