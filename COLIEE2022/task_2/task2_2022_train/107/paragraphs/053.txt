 [53] 
  In  
 Pushpanathan 
 , above, at para. 15, Sharlow, J. (as she then was), determined that the adverse decision on the applicant's appeal from his deportation order had been erroneously based on "the single fact of the commission of the offence." In that case, the offence involved drugs and the applicant was sentenced to eight years imprisonment in 1988 and released on parole in 1991. In  
 Lau 
 , above, which involved the issuance of a deportation order on other grounds, the Federal Court of Appeal held that if Parliament had intended the breach of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , 1976 
 , S.C. 1976-77, c. 52, to be a dominating and determining factor, then there would have been no point in conferring discretion on the decision-maker pursuant to subsection 32(6) of that legislation.
