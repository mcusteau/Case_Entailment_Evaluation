  The confidentiality order sought by Mr. Katwaru also would not meet a number of the important pre-conditions to the granting of such an order that were identified by Robertson, J.A., in  
 Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance) et al. 
 , [2000] 4 F.C. 426; 256 N.R. 1 (F.C.A.), at para. 13, when he stated: 
 
 
 
 "In my opinion the following criteria can be reasonably viewed as conditions precedent to the issuance of a confidentiality order in cases where a party is seeking to prevent the disclosure of information: (1) the information is of a confidential nature as opposed to facts which one would like to keep confidential; (2) the information for which confidentiality is sought is not already in the public domain; (3) on a balance of probabilities the party seeking the confidentiality order would suffer irreparable harm if the information were made public; (4) the information is relevant to the legal issues raised in the case; (5) correlatively, the information is 'necessary' to the resolution of those issues; (6) the granting of a confidentiality order does not unduly prejudice the opposing party; and (7) the public interest in open court proceedings does not override the private interests of the party seeking the confidentiality order. The onus in establishing that criteria one to six are met is on the party seeking the confidentiality order."
