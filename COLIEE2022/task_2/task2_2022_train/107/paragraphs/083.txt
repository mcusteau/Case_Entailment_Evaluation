  That comment by the Director was made after she had summarized the positive and negative considerations that provided the basis for her decision. The comment was made in the context of discussing a possible partial solution to reduce the "certainty of the hardship" that the Director found would be experienced by Mr. Katwaru, his wife and his other family members, should he be returned to Guyana. In this context, I am satisfied that this comment did not render her decision, as a whole, unreasonable.
