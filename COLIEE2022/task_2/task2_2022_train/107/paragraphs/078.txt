  I disagree. The Director was simply drawing a reasonable conclusion, based on the content of those postings and the fact that it is not immediately apparent whether any of those postings were made by people from within Guyana. Indeed, as I have noted above, many of those postings appear to have been made by people in Canada and the United States.
