  The Director then turned to a detailed assessment of the risks that Mr. Katwaru alleged he would face if required to return to Guyana. These risks were grouped into the following four categories: 
 
 
 
 a. his ex-wife's parents/family, who remain in Guyana, will target him for ill-treatment to avenge the death of their grandchild; 
 
 
 
 b. the Guyanese public will target him for ill-treatment based on the negative media coverage of his crime; 
 
 
 
 c. the Guyanese government will target him because of his status as a criminal deportee; and 
 
 
 
 d. he would face various generalized risks, due to the high rate of crime in Guyana, his particular vulnerability as a returning citizen from abroad, the insufficiency of state protection, and tensions between the Indo- and Afro-Guyanese ethnic communities.
