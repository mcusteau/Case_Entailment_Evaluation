  I disagree. At page 9 of her decision, the Director explicitly quoted from Mr. Katwaru's statutory declaration with respect to those threats. After then quoting at length from his friend's sworn statement, she reasonably concluded that the statement provided few details, was vague and was not supported by corroborative evidence. In my view, it was entirely reasonable for the Director to conclude that the statement from Mr. Singh did not provide "sufficient substantiation for the contention that Mr. Katwaru would be threatened or targeted by his ex-wife's family or other unknown individuals."
