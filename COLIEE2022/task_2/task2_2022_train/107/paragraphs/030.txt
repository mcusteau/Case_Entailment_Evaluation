  The issues that have been raised by Mr. Katwaru are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness ( 
 New Brunswick (Board of Management) v. Dunsmuir 
 , [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190; 372 N.R. 1; 329 N.B.R.(2d) 1; 844 A.P.R. 1; 2008 SCC 9, at paras. 51-56;  
 Kisana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2009), 392 N.R. 163; 2009 FCA 189, at para. 18). In short, the Director's decision to reject his H&C application will stand unless it is not within the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , at para. 47). In this regard, "as long as the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility, it is not open to a reviewing court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome" ( 
 Khosa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339; 385 N.R. 206; 2009 SCC 12, at para. 59).
