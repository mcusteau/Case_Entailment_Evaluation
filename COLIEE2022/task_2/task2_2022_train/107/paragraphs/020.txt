  As to the Guyanese public, the Director gave little weight to various anonymous comments that had been posted on the Internet. She determined that there was no support for Mr. Katwaru's claim that they were posted by persons in Guyana and she gave the comments little weight as evidence that the Guyanese public would be in any way galvanized into actively tracking his case and following through with any vigilante acts of street justice. She also observed that it would be open to Mr. Katwaru to bring a motion for confidentiality pursuant to Rule 151 of the  
 Federal Courts Rules 
 , if he could demonstrate a need for confidentiality, notwithstanding the public interest in open and accessible court proceedings. In concluding this part of her assessment, the Director stated that she was satisfied that there was insufficient evidence that the media attention Mr. Katwaru has received to date would jeopardize his safety should he now be returned to Guyana.
