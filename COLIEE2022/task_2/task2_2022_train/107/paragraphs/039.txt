  I am satisfied that Mr. Katwaru fails both prongs of the  
 Sierra Club 
  test. As to the first prong, Mr. Katwaru has not demonstrated that the risk alleged is real and substantial. Far from being well grounded in the evidence and involving a serious threat to his interest in his personal safety, the evidence that he adduced in support of this motion is extremely weak and purely speculative in nature. In addition, I am unable to identify any public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the entire Court file in this proceeding, particularly given that the information in question is already in the public domain, or in granting his alternative request to substitute his name in the style of cause to "X.X."
