  Mr. Katwaru submits that the Director erred in her assessment by applying a "real risk to life" test, as opposed to one of "unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship." He further asserts that while generalized risk cannot be considered in a PRRA assessment, it is appropriate to consider such risk in assessing an H&C application. Relying on  
 Ramirez et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2006), 304 F.T.R. 136; 2006 FC 1404, at para. 5, he maintains that there may well be risk considerations that are relevant to an H&C application, which fall below the higher threshold of risk to life or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, which is the focus in a PRRA application. The implication is that the Director did not consider such general or lower risk considerations in her assessment.
