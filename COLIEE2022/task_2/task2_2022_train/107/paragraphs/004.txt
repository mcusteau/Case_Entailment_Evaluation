  Mr. Katwaru seeks to have the Director's decision set aside on the basis that the Director erred by: 
 
 
 
 a. placing undue weight on one factor to the exclusion of all others in her assessment; 
 
 
 
 b. applying the wrong test in her assessment; and 
 
 
 
 c. unreasonably assessing the evidence before her.
