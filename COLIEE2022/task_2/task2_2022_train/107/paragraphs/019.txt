  After taking note of Mr. Katwaru's written submissions and a statutory declaration that he provided detailing reports from his uncle regarding death threats being made against Mr. Katwaru in Guyana, the Director quoted a sworn statement from Mr. Katwaru's friend that elaborated upon the threats that he had personally heard being made towards Mr. Katwaru. She observed that this statement was vague and not supported by corroborative evidence. Ultimately, she concluded that there was insufficient evidence that (i) Mr. Katwaru's ex-wife's family would carry out any threats made against him should he return to Guyana; or (ii) he would even be known or recognized should he establish himself in another part of Guyana.
