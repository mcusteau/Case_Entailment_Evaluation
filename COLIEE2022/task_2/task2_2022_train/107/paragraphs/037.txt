  Mr. Katwaru also provided Internet postings anonymously made during the period October 6, 2008 to October 13, 2008. It is not immediately apparent to me that any of those postings were made by persons located in Guyana. It is evident that many of them were made by persons in Canada and the U.S. That said, it is possible that some of them were made by persons in Guyana. However, it would be purely speculative to infer, based on the content of those postings, that Mr. Katwaru would face an increased risk to his personal safety if his motion were not granted and if he is ultimately removed to Guyana.
