  On May 23, 2002, the applicant initiated this application for judicial review with respect to the proposed disclosure of the quantities of the vacine and the volume ranges. The applicant submits that because the total value of the contract is public, the release of the quantity of doses and volume ranges would allow a third party to determine the approximate unit prices of the vaccine. Since the ATIP Office determined that the unit prices were exempt pursuant to paragraphs 20(1)(b) and (c), the applicant claims that information that allows a third party to determine the approximate unit prices should also be exempt from disclosure.
