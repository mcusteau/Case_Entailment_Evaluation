  In obiter, I add that Public Works ought inform parties during the bidding process whether the financial terms of a contract, after it is awarded and after public funds are committed to it, will remain confidential. I agree with the Court of Appeal in  
 Hi-Rise Group Inc. 
 , supra, that "absent special circumstances, the public ought to know how its money is being spent, including the terms of the contract". This is to ensure that the government is accountable to the public. If Public Works decides that there is a public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of certain terms of a contract, then Public Works ought make that decision, and make it known to companies submitting tenders or proposals.
