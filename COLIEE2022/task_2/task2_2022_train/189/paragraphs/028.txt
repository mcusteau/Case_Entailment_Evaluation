  In the case at bar, the evidence is clear that the government intended that the total contract price would be public, but the unit prices per dose would remain confidential. There may be a public interest in keeping the unit prices confidential because the government is able to obtain a much lower price from a contractor than the contractor would otherwise be able to offer. In the contract at issue, the applicant certified that the price is not in excess of the lowest price charged anyone else in NAFTA or EEU countries, including the applicant's most favoured customer, and that Public Works is entitled to audit the applicant's books to verify that the price is the lowest price.
