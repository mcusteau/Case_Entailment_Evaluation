  With respect to the third criterion, whether the public benefit is fostered by keeping the information confidential, I must presume that Public Works considered this issue and concluded that keeping the details of the unit prices confidential was in the public's benefit. As I indicated earlier, the decision by Public Works to withhold the unit prices from disclosure is not under review, only the decision to disclose information that would allow a third party to calculate the approximate unit prices. Since Public Works considered it in the public's benefit to withhold the unit prices, it follows that it is in the public's benefit to withhold information that enables a third party to calculate the approximate unit prices. For that reason, I am satisfied that the last criterion of confidentiality, as set out in  
 Air Atonabee 
 , supra, has been met.
