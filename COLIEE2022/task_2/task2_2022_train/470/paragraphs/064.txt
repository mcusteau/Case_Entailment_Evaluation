The problem for the Court is that the Respondents have provided no evidence that would allow the Court to gauge the significance or the legitimacy of the petition as an indicator of band consensus on the issues before the Court. They simply attempt to undermine the legitimacy of the Referendum Vote and place the petition before the Court as a means of doing this. Based upon the record as a whole, the Court must remain highly sceptical of this tactic.
