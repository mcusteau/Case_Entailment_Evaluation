The application for quo warranto, or a declaration in the nature of quo warranto, which the Applicants seek is aimed at the Second Band Custom under which the Respondents were purportedly elected on March 14, 2008. However, whether or not the Respondents were properly elected involves a consideration of Nekaneet customs for band council elections and whether those customs have been replaced by the Referendum Band custom under the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
.
