The Applicants have referred the Court to
Camsell v. Rabesca
, [1987] N.W.T.R. 186 (S.C.), which has received subsequent positive judicial consideration, as an example of a case in which a vote was upheld despite significant irregularities in the voting process because there was no evidence that the irregularities materially affected the result. The petitioners in that case sought to have a liquor plebiscite, in which the majority of the community had voted in favour of prohibition, declared void. Irregularities in the voting process included the late opening of a polling station, the manner in which the election lists were compiled (namely, the addition and deletion of names from a municipal election list by the returning officer assisted by an individual familiar with the community members), the failure to provide interpreters at the polling stations in accordance with the plebiscite regulations, a lack of clarity as to the residence requirement for participation in the vote, the failure to meet the requirement of holding an advance poll, discrepancies between the number of ballots cast and the number recorded, the failure of the returning officer to take an oath, and the failure to initial the ballots in accordance with the applicable legislation.
