Similarly, in the present case, Mr. Walter Wenaas had authority under the voting rules to make rules as to matters of procedure. He was entitled to take the steps that he did in administering the referendum. This argument is particularly strong with respect to measures that he took which could be said to have furthered the electoral process, such as allowing band members to have their completed ballots picked up rather than requiring them to mail the ballots back. This was "consistent with the purpose" of the referendum rules, and should not affect the validity of the vote.
