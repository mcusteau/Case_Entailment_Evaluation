In
Lac des Mille Lacs First Nation et al. v. Chapman et al.
, [1998] 4 C.N.L.R. 57; 149 F.T.R. 227 (T.D.), a "Custom Leadership Selection Code" was adopted by referendum under which the respondents in that case were acclaimed as band councilors. The applicants in
Lac des Mille Lacs
argued that the Selection Code's practices were not generally acceptable to band members and that there was no broad consensus that favoured them. Justice Cullen disagreed. Making reference to the pattern of general non-participation among band members, he held that the participation of 86 voting members out of a population of 300 band members (of which the location of only 130 was known), with a large majority of the 86 in favour of the Selection Code, was a sufficiently broad consensus to constitute the Selection Code as a band custom.
