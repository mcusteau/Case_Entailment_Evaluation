As the Applicants point out, this latter point has formed the basis of a number of decisions upholding election votes. This is seen, for example, in
Samson Indian Band v. Cutknife
(2003), [2004] 1 C.N.L.R. 330; 235 F.T.R. 288 (T.D.). There, the Electoral Supervisor of a councillors' election granted an extension of 24 hours for candidates to deliver the required notarized photographs, and for one of the candidates to submit the required election fees. This formed the basis of an appeal of the election to the Election Appeal Board, which found that the Electoral Supervisor had acted without authority in making the extensions, and ordered a new election. In an application for judicial review, Justice Martineau quashed the Appeal Board's decision. He noted that the Electoral Supervisor has broad general authority to conduct the administration and process of the election, which included the ability to make decisions respecting procedure. He held that granting the extensions was within the Electoral Supervisor's authority, and that doing so was consistent with, and did not defeat, the purpose of the Election Law.
