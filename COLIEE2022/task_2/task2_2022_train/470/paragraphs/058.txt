[58]
Applying these principles to the present case, I think the Court must decide whether the Referendum Band Custom passed at the Referendum Vote of eligible Nekaneet voters residing both on and off reserve and held on February 25, 2008 approving the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
(which together form the Referendum Band Custom), and which replaced any previous band customs at Nekaneet for chief and band council elections, had the support of a sufficiently broad consensus of both resident and non-resident band members. Put simply, the Court needs to decide whether the new regime for electing councils is generally acceptable to the Nekaneet First Nation based upon the evidence before me in this application.
