In order to undermine the referendum process and the Referendum Vote the Respondents raise numerous points. I have reviewed each of them in turn against the evidence presented. While it is true that mistakes were made and that differences of opinion and conflicts of evidence exist, there is nothing that, taken either singly or cumulatively, convinces me that the hard facts of the Referendum Vote do not reflect a broad consensus of what the Nekaneet First Nation truly wants, and that, in my view, is the central issue. I believe that the process leading to the Referendum Vote, if not perfect, was sufficiently informative for the Nekaneet First Nation to know what was at stake and what they were voting for. And I also believe that the voting process itself, notwithstanding the mistakes that were made, allowed a consensus to emerge, even in the face of the obstructive, and sometimes hostile, tactics of the Respondents, which shows that the Nekaneet First Nation favour the transparency and accountability embodied in the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
over the dysfunctional and partisan situation that many members think exists at Nekaneet and that favours some individuals and groups over others. It looks to me as though the Nekaneet people have spoken and that a broad consensus does not favour the Respondents' position on these governance issues.
