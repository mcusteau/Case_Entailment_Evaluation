This is not persuasive evidence on the key issue of the legitimacy of the Referendum Vote. Most of it is hearsay about people who are not even named. The purpose of such evidence is clear. Mr. Mosquito wants to create the impression that people were pressured into casting a favourable vote at the referendum, that the Governance Committee personally interfered to ensure that negative votes were excluded, and that people who did vote in favour did not know what they were doing. But it is all hearsay and innuendo. What is more, the suggestions contained in this evidence are obviously not consistent with facts that are clearly established. For example, not everyone who participated in the Referendum Vote voted in favour of the new regime. The "yes" vote of 113 was 83% of the 136 votes cast. The number of eligible voters was approximately 267. The Respondents organized a petition of 113 votes which they say comes from people who want to continue with the traditional custom of voting. No evidence is provided as to how many of these people voted in the referendum, but the Respondents and their group have been very careful to boycott the whole referendum process in order to deny it legitimacy, so that it is reasonable to suppose that a good number of the petition signers did not participate in the Referendum Vote. All in all, it seems that a significant proportion of eligible voters at Nekaneet have, in one way or another, if the Respondents' own evidence is accepted, participated in recording their views on the governance debate, even though there is no evidence that gives the petition figure a legitimacy as a free vote.
