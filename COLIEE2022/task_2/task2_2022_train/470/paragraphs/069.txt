Justice Rouleau alluded to the necessity of some degree of information being provided prior to a vote on band custom at paragraph 47 of
Wanderingspirit et al. v. Marie et al.
, [2003] 3 C.N.L.R. 332; 235 F.T.R. 106 (T.D.), where he stated at paragraph 47 that "[c]ontrary to the respondent's position, the customary electoral practices of the SRFN cannot be changed on an ad hoc basis at a meeting where there has been no notice given that a proposal to change electoral custom is to be discussed." The test is whether the band custom has been changed by the broad consensus of the band which, as Justice Rouleau put it in
Salt River
, "requires a manifestation of the will of the band members to be bound by a new set of rules."
