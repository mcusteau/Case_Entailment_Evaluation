Lac des Mille Lacs First Nation et al. v. Hogan et al.
(2000), 198 F.T.R. 48 (T.D.) is another case in which an election was held to be void, but again it involved more serious irregularities than the procedural matters in the case at bar. In concluding that the leadership review and election were of no force and effect, Justice Gibson stated as follows at paragraph 21:
"None of these unique features of the Selection Code was respected in the process leading up to and including the leadership review and election purportedly conducted on the 29th of April, 2000. There was no evidence before me that notice of the events scheduled for the 29th of April was broadly distributed among members of the First Nation. Similarly, there was no evidence whatsoever that those members of the First Nation who would likely be unable to attend a meeting in Thunder Bay would be accommodated by communication processes or voting processes that would allow them to effectively take part."
In other words, the election in that case was voided not because of mere procedural irregularities, but because non-compliance with the Selection Code resulted in certain members losing the opportunity to vote. It does not appear to me that any of the steps taken by Mr. Walter Wenaas in the present case would have had the effect of disenfranchising any of the members of Nekaneet; rather, it appears that he was simply attempting to, in the words of Justice Vertes, "facilitate the right to vote."
