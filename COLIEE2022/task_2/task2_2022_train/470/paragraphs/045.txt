[45]
I do not wish to suggest that Mr. Mosquito's evidence is all like this but, on this important and relevant issue, what he says is of little assistance to the Court. For example, the Court needs to know:
a. When and how he was advised by his sisters-in-law, and what is the context that gives what they told him some credibility?
b. Why can't he remember which of his sisters-in-law agreed to vote in favour?
c. Why is this presented as hearsay and why have the sisters-in-law not provided direct evidence on point?
d. Who advised him that the persons picking up the ballots did not discuss the specifics of what members were being asked to vote on? Why don't we have an affidavit from this person and how can Mr. Mosquito generalize on this point the way he does?
e. How does Mr. Mosquito know this is not an isolated occurrence?
f. Who are the other band members who have told him that Members of the Governance Committee, or those working with them, visited members in several locations? Why does Mr. Mosquito not name these other band members? And what, precisely, does Mr. Mosquito say transpired on these other occasions, and how does he know, and how many occasions is he talking about?
g. Why doesn't Mr. Mosquito name the band member he spoke to in paragraph 41 and why has that band member not provided an affidavit?
