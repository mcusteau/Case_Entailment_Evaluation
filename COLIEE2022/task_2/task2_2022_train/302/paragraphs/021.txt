The case at bar then raises three issues.
Issue 1: Did the visa officer err in law by misinterpreting the definition of "Executive Secretary" in
CCDO
4111-111, or by misapplying it to the facts of this case?
Issue 2: Did the visa officer err in law by considering under item 4 ("occupational factor") of Schedule 1 of the
Regulations
the fact that the applicant had worked only for one employer?
Issue 3: Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness in failing to disclose to the applicant her reservations about the relevance of his experience, so that he could respond to them, and in failing to ask him further questions about the present nature of his duties?
