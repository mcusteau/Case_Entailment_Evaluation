In my view, the visa officer made sufficient inquiries to enable her to make a careful assessment and to determine that the applicant merely "compiled" information and did not conduct research. Nor did I think that she was required to disclose to the applicant her understanding of the word "research" as used in
CCDO
4111-111, since she did not ascribe to it a meaning different from that which it has in ordinary usage. Disclosure and giving the applicant an opportunity to respond were not likely to enhance the quality of the visa officer's decision.
