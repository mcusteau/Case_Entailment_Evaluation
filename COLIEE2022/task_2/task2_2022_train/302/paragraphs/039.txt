The visa officer deposed in her affidavit that she did "voice her concerns" to the applicant. However, it is not clear from either the affidavit, or the CAIPS notes, what the precise nature of those concerns was, or whether they were meaningfully communicated to the applicant. The visa officer explained that she records in her CAIPS notes only applicants' responses to her questions, and not the questions that she asks. I am not convinced on the evidence before me that this "voic[ing] of concerns" was sufficient to give the applicant in this case a reasonable opportunity to clarify and expand on the nature of his duties in the absence of the General Manager.
