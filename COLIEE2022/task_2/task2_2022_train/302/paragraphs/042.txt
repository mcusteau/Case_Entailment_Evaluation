I would also add that the visa officer's practice of asking an applicant at the close of an interview whether he or she wishes to add anything is not sufficient to satisfy the duty to make reasonable inquiries that is imposed by the duty of fairness. This practice fails to advise an applicant of the concerns that a visa officer may have in such a way as to provide the applicant with a reasonable opportunity to disabuse the visa officer of his or her particular concerns with an application. Rothstein, J., in
Chen v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 65 F.T.R. 73; 20 Imm. L.R.(2d) 290 (T.D.), wrote that
"... when the visa Officer became concerned that the applicant might not qualify ... she should have questioned him specifically on each of the criteria separately.
For her to have simply expressed concern in a general way and then expected a meaningful response is, in my opinion, not consistent with the requirements of procedural fairness
." (emphasis mine)
