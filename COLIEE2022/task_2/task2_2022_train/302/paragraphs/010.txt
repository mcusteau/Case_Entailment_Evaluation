In a letter dated March 16, 1997, Ms. Fahmy informed the applicant that "In keeping with your qualifications and activities, you were assessed according to the requirements for secretary (CCDO 4111-110)," and that since she had awarded him only 67 units of assessment, three units short of the 70 units normally required for the issue of a visa to an independent applicant, the applicant's application was refused.
