The applicant submits that the visa officer misinterpreted
CCDO
4111-111 by failing to give particular weight to the "lead statement" of the description of an "Executive Secretary". This states that an "Executive Secretary" "performs secretarial and administrative duties for office executive." Mr. Rotenberg submitted that because the applicant worked for the General Manager Purchasing, he clearly falls within this brief description of the occupation, and that his employment experience therefore prima facie qualifies him for the occupation of Executive Secretary.
