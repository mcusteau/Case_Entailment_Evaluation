I am unable to accept this submission. As I have already indicated, whether a person satisfies a particular occupational classification should be determined by reading the description
as a whole
, and by considering the applicant's occupational experience
as a whole
. Accordingly, it would not be helpful for me to pronounce that the applicant had satisfied certain elements of the description, and withdraw them from the visa officer's determination. It is important to remember that Parliament has entrusted to visa officers, not the courts, the duty to determine visa applications, and this court should not usurp that task. Moreover, there was no evidence before me to support Mr. Rotenberg's suggestion that, because Ms. Fahmy's refusal had been set aside, another visa officer was unlikely to discharge his or her professional duty to make a fair assessment of the application.
