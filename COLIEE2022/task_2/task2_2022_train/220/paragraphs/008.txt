  Compuoffice submits that the infringement action is wider in scope than the expungement proceeding, so as to completely address, among other things, the issue of the validity of the registration of the marks in question. Moreover, Compulife's infringement proceedings preceded the expungement proceeding. Accordingly, Compuoffice argues that the court should exercise its discretion to grant a stay since these multiple proceedings launched by Compulife are vexatious and an abuse of process, and therefore, not in the interests of justice.
