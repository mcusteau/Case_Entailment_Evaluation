  For example, it is not entirely clear what Mr. Shwaba's precipitating reason was for fleeing Grenada. His two stories respecting this issue - first at the point of entry, and then in his PIF - are not entirely consistent. Does he fear returning to Grenada because of his stepfather, or because gays are persecuted in his country? And why would telling his aunt about his stepfather's abuse put him at risk? According to his PIF, Mr. Shwaba had already told his mother (Tribunal Record, page 18). As well, according to the notes at the Port of Entry, his community knows about his stepfather's history of abuse (Tribunal Record, page 84). Yet, the Board did not deal with these issues, though the member actually raised them during the hearing, and did not explain how these inconsistencies were resolved in Mr. Shwaba's favour.
