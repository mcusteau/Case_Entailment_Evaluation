  In the present case, it is not necessary to go through the factors that have been considered relevant to determining the content of the duty of fairness. The  
 IRPA 
 , like its predecessor, the  
 Immigration Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, imposes a statutory duty on the Board to provide reasons. Section 169 of the  
 IRPA 
  provides a complete code on the subject, as can be seen from a reading of that provision: 
 
 
 
 " 
 169. Decisions and reasons 
  - In the case of a decision of a Division, other than an interlocutory decision: 
 
 
 
 (a) the decision takes effect in accordance with the rules; 
 
 
 
 (b) reasons for the decision must be given; 
 
 
 
 (c) the decision may be rendered orally or in writing, except a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division, which much be rendered in writing; 
 
 
 
 (d) if the Refugee Protection Division rejects a claim, written reasons must be provided to the claimant and the Minister; 
 
 
 
 (e) if the person who is the subject of proceedings before the Board or the Minister requests reasons for a decision within 10 days of notification of the decision, or in circumstances set out in the rules of the Board, the Division must provide written reasons; and 
 
 
 
 (f) the period in which to apply for judicial review with respect to a decision of the Board is calculated from the giving of notice of the decision or from the sending of written reasons, whichever is later."
