  It is not enough to summarize the parties' submissions, and then state a conclusion without more. Both of the parties are entitled to an analysis of their arguments and of the supporting evidence if the reasons are to serve their purpose:  
 Via Rail Canada Inc. v. National Transportation Agency et al. 
 , [2001] 2 F.C. 25; 261 N.R. 184; 193 D.L.R.(4th) 357 (F.C.A.). Of course, the adequacy of the reasons in any particular case will be contingent on the particular facts of that case and will also be assessed in light of the entire record. If, for example, the transcript of the hearing allows the reader to understand the Board's decision, the reasons may not have to be as detailed.
