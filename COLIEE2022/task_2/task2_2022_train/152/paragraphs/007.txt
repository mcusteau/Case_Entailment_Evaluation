  Admittedly, this jurisprudence derives from paragraph 69.1(11)(b) of the now repealed  
 Immigration Act 
 , but that section was almost identically worded to s. 169(e) of the  
 IRPA 
 . The old provision provided that "if the Minister or the person making the claim requests written reasons within ten days after the day on which the Minister or the person is notified of the decision, the Division shall forthwith give written reasons". Indeed, my colleague Mr. Justice Fran√ßois Lemieux reviewed these cases and applied them to s. 169(e) of the  
 IRPA 
  in his recent decision of  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Ryjkov et al. 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 949; 2005 FC 1540.
