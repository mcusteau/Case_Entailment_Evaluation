 [8] 
  The Board rendered written reasons on February 8, 2006, which are set out in the following three brief paragraphs: 
 
 
 
 "These are the reasons for the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) with respect to the refugee protection claim made by Chris John Shwaba, a citizen of Grenada. The hearing for this claim was held pursuant to s. 170(b) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  ( 
 IRPA 
 ) on December 21, 2005 at Toronto, Ontario. At the conclusion of the hearing the panel rendered an oral positive decision. These are the written reasons which have been edited and syntax and grammar with added references to the documentary evidence and relevant case law where appropriate. 
 
 
 
 I find that Chris John Shwaba, is a Convention refugee based on his orientation as a homosexual or bisexual male. 
 
 
 
 I am satisfied by his straightforward evidence today that this is his sexual orientation. Based on the documentary evidence in the file, I know that there is legislation in Grenada that does not protect people of his sexual orientation and for this reason I find him to be a Convention refugee."
