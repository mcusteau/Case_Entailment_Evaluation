  These principles being too well established to dwell on any further, the only question left to resolve is whether the Board met its obligation in the present case. The simple and unequivocal answer is no. The Board's reasons fail to meet even a skeletal threshold. The absence of any analysis makes a mockery of the right to judicial review. It is impossible to review a decision without being able to evaluate the decision-maker's reasons. Furthermore, the Board's reasons here do not refer to many issues that were critical to Mr. Shwaba's claim.
