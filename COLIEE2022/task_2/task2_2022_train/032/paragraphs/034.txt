  I do not see any error. While marks must not be dissected for minute examination, individual features of a mark may be examined for comparison purposes ( 
 United Artists Corp. v. Pink Panther Beauty Corp. et al. 
  (1998), 225 F.T.R. 82; 80 C.P.R.(3d) 247 (F.C.A.), at para. 34. The first part of a mark is particularly important and is often examined on its own ( 
 Conde Nast Publications Inc. v. Union des Editions Modernes 
  (1979), 46 C.P.R.(2d) 183 (F.C.T.D.), at 188). The Registrar may also look to how marks are presented to the public ( 
 Pink Panther 
 , at para. 37). In this case, the Registrar notes that, in presentation of the mark, the Applicant often downplays the words BY WRANGLER. Based on the jurisprudence referred to, I view this examination of the Applicant's mark as entirely acceptable.
