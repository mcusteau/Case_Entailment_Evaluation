 [5] 
  The Applicant submits that this "new" evidence establishes that, in June 2004, TIMBERLAND sandals, shoes and boots continued to co-exist in the Canadian marketplace with TIMBERLINE sandals, shoes and boots. The Applicant asserts that the significance of this additional evidence is: 
 
 
 
 - It establishes for the first time that the trademark TIMBERLINE is used with the full range of footwear with which the TIMBERLAND mark is used and not just with boots; and, 
 
 
 
 - It establishes this co-existence as of June 2004, less than 3 months after the relevant date (March 5, 2004) for the determination of whether the Applicant's mark is registrable; the evidence that had been before the Registrar was almost 4 years prior to the relevant date, making the new evidence much more timely.
