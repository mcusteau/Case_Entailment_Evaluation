  Considered in those terms, the Respondent, by using the words of concern to the Applicant, was not applying a stricter "still in doubt" test, but was correctly describing his state of mind after reviewing all of the evidence and determining that the probabilities were equal. I am satisfied that the Registrar applied the correct test throughout his analysis. Accordingly, I conclude that the line of analysis taken by the Registrar to find that the burden of proof had not been met by the Applicant was reasonable. 
 
 
 
 Issue #2(b) Did the Registrar err by incorrectly dissecting or considering the use of the trademarks in his assessment under s. 6(5)(e) of the Trade-marks Act, R.S.C. 1985, as amended (the "Act")?
