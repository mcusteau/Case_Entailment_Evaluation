  In my view, this information does no more than supplement the evidence that was before the Registrar. The record already shows that TIMBERLINE footwear, including boots and shoes, was available across Canada in 1997 and 1998. Only sandals were not specifically mentioned in the record. However, this is not a material difference. What the Applicant puts forward is "quantity" and not "quality" evidence and, accordingly, does not satisfy the test for "new" evidence.
