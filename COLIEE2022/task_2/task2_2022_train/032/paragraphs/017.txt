  Some background may be helpful at this point. The Respondent, the opponent of both registrations (that is, for clothing and footwear), raised four grounds before the Registrar. 
 
 
 
 - The first ground was, in essence, a procedural one that was dismissed quickly by the Registrar and is of no consequence to this application. 
 
 
 
 - The second ground of opposition was that the applied-for marks were confusing with two trademarks of TIMBERLAND when used with (a) leather goods; and (b) footwear and clothing (s. 12 (1)(d) of the  
 Act 
 ). 
 
 
 
 - The third ground was that, as of the applicant's filing date, the applied-for mark itself was confusing with the two TIMBERLAND marks and with the trade name The Timberland Company (s. 16(3) of the  
 Act 
 ). 
 
 
 
 - Finally, the Respondent opposed the registrations on the ground that the applicant's trademark was not capable of distinguishing the applicant's wares in view of the use of the opponent's trademark and tradename in Canada in association with footwear, clothing and accessories.
