  Moving on to the third ground of opposition, the Registrar finds that the Applicant has satisfied the burden on it to show that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the opponent's mark and the applicant's mark TIMBER CREEK BY WRANGLER for clothing. However, with respect to the use for footwear, the Registrar concludes by stating: 
 
 
 
 "For reasons similar to those discussed in relation to the second ground of opposition against the second application, I find that the applicant has not satisfied the burden on it to show no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the opponent's mark and name and the applicant's mark TIMBER CREEK BY WRANGLER for footwear. For the reasons previously discussed,  
 I must find that the probabilities of confusion favour neither one side nor the other. In such a situation, I must resolve my uncertainty against the applicant 
 . Thus, the third ground of opposition against application No. 789,948 [footwear] is successful." (Emphasis added)
