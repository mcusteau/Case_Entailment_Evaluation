  In my view, the court, in this passage was equating a "still in doubt" test with one where an applicant was required to prove lack of confusion beyond a reasonable doubt. If such a standard were applied by the Registrar, I would have to conclude that there was a reviewable error. The correct standard is balance of probabilities.
