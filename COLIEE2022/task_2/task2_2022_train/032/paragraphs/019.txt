  Having made these findings, the Registrar states as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Given those findings, I am left with a situation where the opponent's mark has become known for both clothing and footwear, the wares and trades of the parties are similar and the marks bear a fair degree of resemblance. Notwithstanding the third party uses of the marks TIMBER BAY for clothing and TIMBERLINE for footwear,  
 I find that, on a balance of probabilities, the applicant has not discharged its burden to show that the marks at issue are not confusing. In other words, I find that I am left in a state of doubt respecting the issue (i.e. -the probabilities one way or the other are equal) and I must therefore resolve that doubt against the applicant 
 . Thus, the second ground of opposition in respect of application No. 789,948 is successful." (Emphasis added)
