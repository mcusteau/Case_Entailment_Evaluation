The issue for determination here is not whether the Applicant Sanchez personally committed a crime in the nature of personally killing or injuring or shooting someone but rather were there "serious reasons to believe" that he "committed a crime against peace, a war crime, or crime against humanity" because he was "complicit" in such a crime. "Complicity" has its genesis in the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Ramirez supra, where the word "committed" in Article 1 F(a) was equated with someone who had "personal knowledge and knowing participation", and was "an accomplice and abettor". MacGuigan J.A. for the Court at paragraphs 15 and 16 said:
15 I am not unmindful of the dangers of reading an international convention in the light of the interpretation of domestic American law by American courts, and I do not propose to do so. Nevertheless, the American case law represents a helpful starting point as to the meaning of the word "committed" in the Convention. From the premise that a mens rea interpretation is required, I find that the standard of "some personal activity involving persecution," understood as implying a mental element or knowledge, is a useful specification of mens rea in this context. Clearly no one can "commit" international crimes without personal and knowing participation.
16 What degree of complicity, then, is required to be an accomplice or abettor?
