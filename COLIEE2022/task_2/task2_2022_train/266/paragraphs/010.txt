The finding of the Board in the present case is stated in its conclusion:
Conclusion
The panel finds that the Minister has provided corroborated evidence (Sabour v. Canada (MCI), IMM-3268-99, F.C.T.D. (2000) at para. 17) that the Colombian army has committed widespread and systematic crimes against humanity. The panel examined the evidence submitted by the claimant and counsel's submissions. The Minister's response to these submissions has also been taken into consideration. The panel, however, finds that the evidence presented by the Minister demonstrates that Mr. Sanchez should be held to be complicit in these crimes because such crimes were particularly committed in counter-insurgency operations. Therefore, even if the panel was to believe that the claimant did not shoot or kill anyone, the claimant was a knowing and active participant in those counter-insurgency operations.
On the basis of all of the factors analyzed above, there are serious reasons for considering that Mr. Sanchez has been an accomplice in crimes against humanity during his service with the Colombian army. He falls within the parameters of Article 1F(a) and should be excluded from protection in Canada.
