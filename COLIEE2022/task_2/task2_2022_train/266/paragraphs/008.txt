Recently Justice Layden-Stevenson of this Court has considered the issue of "complicity" in Zazai v. Canada (MCI) 2004 F.C. 1356 at paragraph 27, where the concepts of "close association with the principle actors" and "a shared common purpose" were stated:
Accomplices as well as principal actors may be found to have committed international crimes (although, for present purposes, I am not concerned with principal actors). The Court accepted the notion of complicity defined as a personal and knowing participation in Ramirez and complicity through association whereby individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close association with the principal actors in Sivakumar. Complicity rests on the existence of a shared common purpose and the knowledge that all of the parties may have of it: Ramirez; Moreno.
