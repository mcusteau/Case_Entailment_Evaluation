What is the "organization"; is it the "Columbian army" or is it the "Mobile Brigade" or the "Palace Battalion" or is it the "unit/brigade" Special Forces #1 to which Sanchez was assigned? One must return to the definition of "commits" as discussed in Ramirez and Zazai, supra in order to assess the matters on a "functional and pragmatic" approach to the question. The "organization" must be one that has a "personal knowledge and knowing participation", it must "share a common purpose". Given this approach it cannot be the Colombian army taken as a whole, which in law must be found to have a limited, brutal purpose. There was no such finding in respect of the army as a whole. The organization must be the particular "unit/brigade" to which Sanchez was assigned at the time that he was assigned to it.
