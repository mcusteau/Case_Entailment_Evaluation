During the course of his cross-examinaÂ­tion, Dr. Fallis admitted that a crystalline form of paroxetine hydrochloride "... that could be polymorphic ..." could be made by using the generic claim 1 in the '390 patent in the event that the right substituents were chosen. Although some form of paroxetine hydrochloride could therefore be made using claim 1 of the '390 patent, he did not know what form would result, given that the '390 patent gives "no indication of form" and no discrete recipe for paroxetine hydrochloride. In contrast, the '023 patent "... is specifically directed to various forms ..." of paroxetine hydrochloride, and the product can be tailored to one form or another. Although the form of paroxetine hydrochloride made under claim 1 of the '390 patent could not be predicted ahead of time, various means exist for analyzing a compound to determine its form, including X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy and examining melting points.
