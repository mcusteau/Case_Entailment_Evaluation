In order to determine the intention of Parliament in enacting s. 6(7) of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, assistance may be obtained by examining the circumstances leading to its enactment, as well as the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement prepared as part of the regulatory process. A Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, which accompanies but does not form part of the
Regulations
, reveals the intentions of the government and contains "... information as to the purpose and effect of the proposed regulation". (See
Teal Cedar Products (1977) Ltd. v. Canada
, [1989] 2 F.C. 135; 19 F.T.R. 35 (T.D.) at p. 140 [F.C.]).
