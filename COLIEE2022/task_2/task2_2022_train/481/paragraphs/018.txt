Prior to the enactment of s. 6(7), there was no express legislative authority permitting the court to order, for use in litigation under the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, the production of confidential information filed with the Minister in a submission for a notice of compliance. Given the legislative vacuum, issues arose in litigation under the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
concerning the production of confidential information filed with the Minister and the circumstances in which production could be ordered. In various cases, the court concluded that confidential information filed with the Minister in a submission for a notice of compliance was subject to production in circumstances where the relevance of the information was established by the party seeking production. (See, for example,
Merck Frosst Canada Inc. et al. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(1994), 75 F.T.R. 97; 53 C.P.R.(3d) 368 (T.D.), affd. (1994), 169 N.R. 342; 55 C.P.R.(3d) 302 (F.C.A.);
Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc. v. Apotex Inc.
(1996), 110 F.T.R. 235; 68 C.P.R.(3d) 114 (T.D.) at p. 117 (C.P.R.);
Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.
(1996), 69 C.P.R.(3d) 81 (F.C.T.D.)) In two of those decisions, namely
Janssen Pharmaceutica Inc. v. Apotex Inc.
, supra, and
Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.
, supra, the court ordered the Minister to produce from the departmental files certain portions of the new drug submission on the basis that the confidential information was relevant to an issue raised in the proceeding.
