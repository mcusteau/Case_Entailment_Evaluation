I should also make some observations on the credibility of the witnesses. The credibility of Mr. Harris, as a disgruntled former employee of the respondents, was attacked by counsel for the latter. While it is clear that Mr. Harris would have some motives for giving evidence prejudicial to the respondents, I am satisfied that his evidence was truthful. He had a very clear recollection of details and his testimony was not seriously weakened on cross-examination. With respect to certain of the dealers who testified on behalf of the applicant, counsel for the respondents sought to show that they had some financial interest in now favouring Apple, the applicant. I found these witnesses to be truthful and I am not at all persuaded that they altered their evidence in order to find favour with Apple. The principal witness for the respondents, Mr. Ho, could not of course testify to events before his arrival in June, 1986, some seven months after the first injunction was issued. Further, the whole of his evidence was seriously weakened in my view by his explanation that the sales of Apple compatible computers without, as he said, ROM chips, was for the purpose of providing repair parts to dealers. That some hundreds of computers should be sold for this purpose defies belief.
