(1) Breach of copyright in program - As I understand it, the applicant's program alleged to have been infringed is an enhanced Apple IIe operating system program known as the Apple Enhanced Program which is the subjectmatter of Canadian Copyright 344,382. This program is contained in ROM chips mounted on the motherboard of the computer in which they are employed. While ROM chips are manufactured containing such programs, a functional equivalent for such chips can be made by copying them by a process of burning the same program into an EPROM chip. The respondents contend that while they sold computers which were Apple-compatible and which would be made operable by the insertion of such chips, they did not sell computers containing such chips. Further they say that the injunction misdescribed the registered copyright of whose infringement the applicant complains.
