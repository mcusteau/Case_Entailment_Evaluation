(3) Infringement of Trademark - The keyboards of each of the computers put before me as exhibits include two keys bearing symbols which appear to consist of a circle with a bent line proceeding from the top centre point of the circumference which, when taken with the circle below it, certainly gives the impression of being the stem of a round fruit. One of these symbols has an "open" circle, that is, with just the circumference outlined in black; the other is "closed" or solid, the circle being completely black. Counsel for the respondents admitted that all of the computers like Exhibit P-6 sold by the respondents had such symbols on them. Mr. Martin, the applicant's expert, who was present at the time of the raid on the Comtex premises, said that the two computers which he examined there had such symbols and that representatives of the respondents said that all the other computers which were packed in boxes on the premises were similar.
