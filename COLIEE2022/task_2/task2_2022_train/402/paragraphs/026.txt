I should simply note that Walsh, J., in finding a prima facie case of breach of copyright proceeded on the basis of the then current jurisprudence to the effect that such drawings could be the subject of copyright and not within the Industrial Design Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-8. To the extent that the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Bayliner Marine Corp. v. Doral Boats Ltd. (1986), 67 N.R. 139; 10 C.P.R.(3d) 289 (F.C.A.), might now suggest a different conclusion, this is irrelevant as the respondents were obliged to obey the injunction as issued.
