I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondents here were well aware of the existence of these court orders even though they were not served with copies. It is clear that service of the order is only one method of proof of knowledge of respondents in a show cause proceeding. (Miller, Contempt of Court (London, 1976) at 243.) In the present case, I have reached the conclusion that the respondents must have known of these orders, both because of the conduct of their counsel in the proceedings and from evidence of their own conduct.
