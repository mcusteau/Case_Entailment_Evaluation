I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the individual respondents, Lami Yee Lam, Jack Liu, and Jack Wu, and the two corporations they control, O.S. Micro Systems Inc., and Comtex Micro System Inc., are guilty of contempt. I believe they all acted in such a way as to interfere with the orderly administration of justice and to impair the authority or dignity of the court and to render nugatory an injunction or order of this court. This is sufficient to fix them with liability for contempt although I also have concluded that the respondents against whom the injunctions were issued, namely O.S. Micro Systems Inc., Lami Yee Lam, and Jack Liu, are also guilty of contempt for having disobeyed an injunction issued against them.
