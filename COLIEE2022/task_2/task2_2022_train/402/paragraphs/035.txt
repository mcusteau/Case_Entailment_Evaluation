The hearing of this matter proceeded as on a motion as there had been no order for it to be heard as a trial. By consent of the parties, evidence was allowed to be taken viva voce as permitted by rule 319(4). A problem arose with respect to the presentation of an expert's testimony, namely that of Robert Martin called on behalf of the applicant. It not being a trial, rule 482 with respect to the requirement that a statement of the proposed evidence of an expert be filed and served at least ten days in advance of its presentation did not apply. Counsel for the respondents objected to the lack of such statement. In order to ensure fairness to the respondents in a manner consistent with the requirements of rule 482 I ruled that insofar as the expert's evidence as to his testing of computer components had already been disclosed in the affidavits previously filed by the applicant in earlier proceedings connected with the injunctions and the Anton Piller order, such evidence could be presented by Mr. Martin. To the extent that such information had not been previously communicated, I ruled that it could not be introduced as evidence. Mr. Martin was thereby limited in his evidence in chief. However, counsel for the respondents cross-examined Mr. Martin on areas with respect to which I had held that he could not give evidence in chief. This having happened, I allowed counsel for the applicant to reexamine with respect to those areas opened up by counsel for the respondents on cross-examination. All of this suggests that in cases of this nature consideration should be given in advance to the possibility of an order under rule 327 directing the trial of such issues with directions concerning pre-trial procedure and the conduct of the trial.
