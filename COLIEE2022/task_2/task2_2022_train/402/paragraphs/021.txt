While some of this evidence is circumstantial it is consistent only with the guilt of the respondents. I was not impressed by the main witness called on their behalf to refute it. This witness was Reggie Ho who has been an employee of the respondents since June, 1986. In the first place it is clear that he could not testify as to what had happened prior to the time he started working there which was some seven months after the injunction was issued. He insisted that all Apple-compatible computers were sold without ROM or EPROM chips containing the program which is the subject of the copyright in question. Yet he was unable to give any evidence of his personal knowledge of other non-infringing chips which would make such computers operational. When asked why dealers would acquire all of these computers which would be nonfunctional without infringing chips, he could only suggest that they were purchased for parts for other computers. This appears to me so unlikely as to put into serious question any of Mr. Ho's evidence. His explanation as to why there were numerous infringing chips on the premises on the day of the raid was that these might have been there since before the injunctions or might have been returned by dealers or could have been in computers brought in for servicing. I find his evidence highly improbable as an explanation for all of these sales or for the presence of so many infringing chips on the premises.
