On June 15, 1987 the Associate Chief Justice granted a show cause order under rule 355 ordering the respondents named above to appear to show cause why they should not be condemned for contempt of this court for breach of the said injunctions or for
"acting in such a way as to interfere with the orderly administration of justice and to impair the authority or dignity of the court and to render nugatory any injunction or Order of this court."
On June 29, 1987 Teitelbaum, J., ordered that this show cause hearing take place in Vancouver commencing October 27, 1987. He also ordered
"... that all material, including affidavit evidence in support of the application will be served and filed not later than the 25th day of September 1987 and any reply material not later than the 13th day of October 1987."
No further affidavit material was in fact filed after that date prior to the hearing. There was a pre-trial conference before the Associate Chief Justice in Toronto on September 14, 1987 but no order or minutes emerged from that conference to guide the conduct of the hearing. It was apparently understood that viva voce evidence would be presented at the hearing.
