On March 26, 1987 Rouleau, J., on an ex parte application by the plaintiff Apple, issued an Anton Piller order in another action (T-664-87) commenced by it against certain of the same, plus other, defendants authorizing the plaintiff to search certain premises of the defendants to gather evidence for that other action concerning essentially the same subject-matter. It was understood when the order was granted that this search would also involve possible evidence of breaches of the earlier injunction. This order was executed on March 31, 1987 at the premises of the respondent Comtex Micro System Inc. in Vancouver. Several dozen computers and other materials were seized at that time. Unfortunately, the computers and other materials so seized, apart from a few documents, were destroyed in a fire at the warehouse of the Vancouver Sheriff and were thus not available as evidence at the hearing before me.
