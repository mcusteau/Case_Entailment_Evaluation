Certain of the defendants, including O.S. Micro Systems Inc., Lami Yee Lam, and Jack Liu appealed that order. They were represented by Mr. MacFarlane. On November 29, 1985 the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal.

I was advised by counsel that the injunction in these terms was continued with the consent of counsel for the relevant defendants.
