Counsel for the respondents took certain objections to me looking at the court file in respect of matters such as service or admission of service of the injunction. As this matter was proceeded with by way of motion, rule 319(2) applied and it provides:
"(2) A motion shall be supported by affidavit as to all the facts on which the motion is based
that do not appear from the record
..." (Emphasis added).
There is no definition of "record" in the rules in this context nor have I been able to find any in the jurisprudence. I am satisfied that the "record" on a show cause motion includes those elements of the file relevant to the issues before the court for determination; and that documents on the court file may be assumed to be what they purport to be unless proven to the contrary. This does not mean that their contents must be automatically taken as proven, of course, but where the contents purport to be an admission of service by the solicitor of record this can be taken as proof of that fact in the absence of proof to the contrary.
