The Board found no credible evidence that the applicant's ankle condition is consequential to his pension conditions of pes planus in the right foot and left foot. The Court finds the evidence from Dr. Taylor confusing. There is also other medical evidence which considers the applicant's ankle injury including the report dated October 18, 2001 of Dr. Lang, who practices with Dr. Saunders at the St. Margaret's Bay Medical Centre. The Board must weigh this evidence to determine whether the applicant has established a case, and resolve in favour of the applicant any doubt. It is not clear from the decision whether the Board applied this statutory burden of proof, namely that any doubt was to be resolved in favour of the applicant.
