In its entirety, the medical opinion of Dr. Saunders dated July 5, 2004 states:
"Mr. Youden notes recurrent ankle sprain, pain and weakness since his DND injury in 1986. He has pes planus which is often predisposed to foot and ankle pain or instability.
His pes planus is likely a major contributing factor to his ankle instability and disability
