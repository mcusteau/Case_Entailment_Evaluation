For these reasons, the Court has concluded that:
1. the Board made a patently unreasonable credibility finding with respect to the medical opinion of Dr. Saunders dated July 5, 2004 because the Board disregarded the clear reference in its previous decision that Dr. Saunders had a historical, professional relationship with the applicant and did physically examine the applicant; and
2. the Board erred by not making clear whether it applied the statutory burden of proof in section 39 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Act
to the facts. On this basis, the decision does not stand up to a somewhat probing examination so that the decision is not reasonable.
