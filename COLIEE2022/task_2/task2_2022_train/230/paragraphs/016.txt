The applicant submits that the Board erred in finding the document not credible and of little weight because it ignored evidence before the Board on a prior relevant proceeding on June 27, 2003. At that time, a physician's statement from Dr. Saunders dated 24 December 2002 (AA-Y2) disclosed a doctor-patient relationship with Mr. Youden and an instance of physical examination. In the Board's decision dated June 27, 2003 with respect to the applicant's application for an increase in his pension for pes planus of both feet, the Board quoted the medical opinion of Dr. Saunders as follows:
"Mr. Youden was seen December 23, 2002 regarding his feet. He does have bilateral pes planus and significant callous formation on both feet over the first metatarsal, lateral foot, and heels."
