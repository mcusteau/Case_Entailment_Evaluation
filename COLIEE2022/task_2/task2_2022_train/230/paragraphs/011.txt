The third factor is the purpose of the applicable legislation, namely that of the
Board Act
and
Pension Act
. The preamble of the
Pension Act
explains its purpose is to "provide pensions and other benefits to members of the forces". Section 3 of the
Board Act
explains that it is to be liberally construed in recognition of the Crown's obligation to members of the forces and their dependants. Section 39 of that
Act
mandate the Board to exercise its function in accordance with rules of evidence that favour applicants when drawing inferences, resolving doubt, and accepting uncontradicted evidence. The purpose of the legislation favours deference to the Board's decisions, providing it properly discharges its evidentiary obligations to applicants.
