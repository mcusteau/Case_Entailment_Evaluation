The fact that the applicant appeared for himself on the opposition proceedings and was not represented by a lawyer does not justify an extension of time in this case, particularly not a six week period as is sought here. The fact that the applicant acted for himself, particularly when the applicant communicated with counsel prior to the expiry of the appeal period to indicate an intention to appeal, is not a compelling reason to exercise the court's discretion to grant an extension. There is nothing indicating that the applicant was not aware of the two month time limit.
