Reed, J.
[orally]: On the basis of the jurisprudence which has been cited to me [see footnote 1] I have not been persuaded that the present application is one which should be granted. In my view, the evidence regarding the all but completed negotiations with Pillsbury (another opposition proceeding vis-Ã -vis the respondents' application for registration of the trademark PIZZA FINGERS) persuades me that the respondents would suffer considerable prejudice if the time for filing an appeal were now extended.
