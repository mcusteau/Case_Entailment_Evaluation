[4]
The appellant states that the Registrar erred in fact and in law in concluding that the trademark "MacGregor" was not in use in Canada within the meaning of section 4(1) of the Act, in concluding that the same trademark was not in use in Canada within the meaning of section 4(3) of the Act and in concluding that the registration for the trademark "MacGregor" ought to be expunged from the register. Therefore, the appellant seeks an order allowing this appeal and quashing the decision of the Registrar.
