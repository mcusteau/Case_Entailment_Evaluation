In this regard, the respondent submits that the registered owner of the trademark "MacGregor", National Sea Products Ltd, has established use, if any, only by its subsidiary, National Sea Products Inc. and thus the registration ought to be expunged. I do not agree. Although the only name which appears on the packaging is National Sea Products Inc., that company is clearly shown as the distributor of what is a Canadian product. As such, I agree with the appellant's view that the use of the trademark still accrues to his benefit. (See Mayborn Products Ltd. v. Registrar of Trademarks (1983), 70 C.P.R.(2d) 1).
