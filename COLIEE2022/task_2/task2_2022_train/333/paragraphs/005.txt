In reply to the notice of appeal, the respondent states in essence that the Registrar's decision to expunge the trademark "MacGregor" under section 44(5) of the Act was correct both in fact and in law; the respondent also states that the appellant both before the Registrar and in this appeal has failed to establish that the trademark "MacGregor" is in use by the registered owner thereof within the meaning of section 4(1) and section 4(3) of the Act. Therefore, the respondent requests that this appeal be dismissed with costs.
