The respondent further contends that the use which has been established is only in association with smoked kippered herring and with none of the other listed wares; therefore, the respondent submits that the registration, if upheld, must be restricted to smoked kippered herring only. I agree. Under section 44 of the Act the registered owner must demonstrate use in connection with all of the wares enumerated in the registration. Nowhere in the evidence is it shown that the mark was used in association with any other wares than smoked kippered herring at the relevant time and no reason whatsoever is given for the absence of such use.
