  The Applicant began the process of transitioning from elections under the  
 Indian Act 
  to a custom election code when he was Chief of the First Nation. The transition was made according to the "Conversion to Community Election System Policy" (the "Policy") from the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (the "Department"). The Applicant submits that the impetus was driven by a desire to decrease the number of elections and provide stability in the community by increasing the term of office from two to three years.
