  The First Nation held referendum votes, even though they are not technically required. In the Second and Continuation Vote, 48% of the eligible voters participated, and the  
 Election Act 
  was adopted by a high majority of those who voted (84%). Slightly less than a majority of First Nation members voted, and only 72 First Nation members voted against the  
 Election Act 
  in the Second and Continuation Vote. With such a high percentage of voters in favour of the  
 Election Act 
 , even an additional 22 votes (the missing number for a participation rate of 50% + 1) against the  
 Election Act 
  would not have affected the outcome of the Second Vote and Continuation Vote. Moreover, the Department itself recognized the need to be flexible in accommodating the concept of "broad consensus", since the Department's Policy stipulates that an election code will be considered approved by the community if a majority of electors vote by secret ballot to approve it,  
 or 
  if "the community approves them in such other manner as the First Nation and the department may agree upon". In the present case, an official of the Department encouraged the First Nation to request the Minister to issue an order removing the First Nation from the  
 Indian Act 
  election provisions based on the combined results of the Second and Continuation Vote. These factors weigh heavily in favour of finding that there was a broad consensus among members of the First Nation to the  
 Election Act 
  and its education provisions.
