 [59] 
  Accordingly, given that the education provisions clearly distinguish between First Nation members on the basis of merit and capacities, they are unlikely to be indicators of discrimination, since they deal with personal attributes rather than characteristics based on association with a group. Educational upgrading opportunities are available, enabling the Applicant to change the characteristic which causes him to be ineligible to run for the position of Chief. The Applicant has received a GED equivalent to a grade 10 education, and no submissions were made as to why he could not further upgrade his education. While it is obviously more difficult as one grows older to obtain a higher educational level, it does not rise to the level of the immutable characteristics such as those listed in subsection 15(1) of the  
 Charter
