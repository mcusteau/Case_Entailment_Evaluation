  What constitutes a broad consensus has been described by the courts in various ways. A broad consensus may in appropriate circumstances be discerned from the cumulative effect of a number of events, or it may result from one event such as the adoption of a particular code:  
 Nekaneet First Nation v Oakes 
 , 2009 FC 134, [2009] FCJ no 183, at para 39;  
 McLeod Lake Indian Band v Chingee, 
  [1998] FCJ no 1185, 153 FTR 257 (FCTD). It is also recognized that the content of the custom of a band may vary from time to time, and from one band to another, according to the will of the band members: see  
 McLeod Lake Indian Band v Chingee, 
  [1998] FCJ no 1185, 153 FTR 257 (FCTD) at para 19;  
 Six Nations Traditional Hereditary Chiefs v Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs) 
 , [1991] FCJ no 141, 43 FTR 132 (FCTD);
