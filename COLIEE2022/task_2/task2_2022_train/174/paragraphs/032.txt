  In  
 Awashish v Opitciwan Atikamekw Band Council 
 , 2007 FC 765, [2007] FCJ no 1021, a new election code was adopted at a public meeting of band members after extensive consultations. The new code was used shortly thereafter in the band's elections without dispute. It was only after the elections were over that some members of the band made complaints, which ultimately led to the suspension of the code and a new election using the previous custom election procedures. The respondents contended that the new election code was never valid because it did not reflect a broad consensus of the band, having not been supported by a majority vote of the electors at a referendum. The Court held that it was not necessary for the Council to proceed by referendum in order to ensure that it had the support of a majority of the public before adopting the Electoral Code (although it may have been preferable), since the Code was adopted at a public assembly after extensive consultation, and the community had acquiesced to its use in the 2005 elections.
