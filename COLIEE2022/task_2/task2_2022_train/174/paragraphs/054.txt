 [54] 
  Counsel for the Applicant alleges that paragraphs 9.03(c) and 10.01(d) of the  
 Election Act 
  are discriminatory and contrary to section 15 of the  
 Charter 
  because they impose a differential treatment based on one or more enumerated analogous grounds. While the grounds on which an electoral officer may refuse to certify a candidate for election are not explicitly based on enumerated grounds, it is alleged that educational attainment is analogous to race and age. Indeed, requiring a Grade 12 education would perpetuate a disadvantage and stereotype, because education in aboriginal communities is less formalistic and would disproportionately affect older band members and residential school survivors.
