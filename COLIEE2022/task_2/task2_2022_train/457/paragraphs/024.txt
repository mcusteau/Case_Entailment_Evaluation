The precedents are not clear as to the standard of review applicable to a decision based on a PRRA. Some feel that the standard of patent unreasonableness decision would be appropriate, while others maintain that reasonableness simpliciter is the standard that should be adopted (see inter alia
Babai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 772; [2004] F.C.J. No. 1614 (F.C.),
Khatoon et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1408; 245 F.T.R. 96 (F.C.),
Sidhu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 28; [2004] F.C.J. No. 30 (F.C.) and
Dissanayakage v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 350; [2004] F.C.J. No. 712 (F.C.)). However, the case law indicates that no one has made a final ruling on this point: it always states it is not necessary or appropriate to do so. Nevertheless, based on the record, I do not think that makes much difference in view of the fact that there was ample foundation for the officer's decision and it was supported by the record. Even a less demanding standard like that of reasonableness simpliciter does not imply intervention by the Court, since the officer's decision was reasonable and based on a defensible explanation (see
Director of Investigation and Research, Competition Act v. Southam Inc. et al.
, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748; 209 N.R. 20, and
Ryan v. Victoria (City) et al.
, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 201; 234 N.R. 201; 117 B.C.A.C. 103; 191 W.A.C. 103).
