For his part, the respondent argued that, even accepting the applicant's argument, the officer's error was not determinative because the application for judicial review was dismissed by Pinard, J., on March 18, 2004. He further maintained that the applicant was subject to a removal order which was in force within the meaning of s. 112(1) of the
Act
. Finally, the respondent argued that s. 49(2) of the
Act
provides when a removal order comes into force, and in the case at bar it had already come into force, despite the fact that the applicant had filed an application for judicial review.
