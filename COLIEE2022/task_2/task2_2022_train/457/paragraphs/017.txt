The applicant argued then that s. 112 of the
Act
, regarding the PRRA, provides that for the review to be made the person in question must be subject to an order that is in force. However, he submitted that in the case at bar the PRRA was done too early because the order was not yet in force, as the Court's judgment on judicial review of the Board's decision had not yet been rendered. Specifically, the PRRA application was dismissed on January 28, 2004 and this Court's judgment on judicial review of the Board's decision was rendered on March 18, 2004. Section 112(1) of the
Act
reads as follows:
"112(1) A person in Canada, other than a person referred to in subsection 115(1), may, in accordance with the regulations, apply to the Minister for protection if they are subject to a removal order that is in force or are named in a certificate described in subsection 77(1)."
