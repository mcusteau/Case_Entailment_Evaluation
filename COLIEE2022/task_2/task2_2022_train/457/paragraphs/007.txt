As previously mentioned, the applicant's PRRA application was dismissed on January 28, 2004, on the ground that the applicant was not in danger of being (Translation) "tortured or persecuted, suffering cruel or unusual treatment or punishment or being subject to a risk to his life if he was removed to [his] country of nationality or habitual residence". The applicant was accordingly required to leave Canada and confirm his departure, because the removal order made against him had to be enforced.
