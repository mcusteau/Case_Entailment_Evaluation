  I begin by reviewing the essence of the Citizenship Judge's decision. It appears that the key problem identified by the Judge was one of credibility; the Judge simply did not believe the Applicant's claims of residence. In his application, the Applicant declared that he had been absent from Canada for 194 days, which left him with 1,106 days of physical presence in Canada. However, this declaration differed from his residency questionnaire (RQ), where he declared only 33 days of absence from Canada. As a result of this discrepancy, information was gathered and the Judge interviewed the Applicant. In her decision, the Citizenship Judge described a number of problems with the Applicant's corroborating documentation, including: 
 
 
 
 • the Applicant failed to declare six absences from Canada; 
 
 
 
 • the Applicant submitted documents that were outside the relevant time period and bank records not solely in his name; 
 
 
 
 • the Applicant failed, although requested, to bring evidence of his alleged employment in Canada; and 
 
 
 
 • alleged dates of pay and the amounts of pay did not correspond with bank records.
