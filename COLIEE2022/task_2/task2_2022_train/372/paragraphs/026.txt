The Board's conclusions are all the more reasonable because of the fact that the Applicant had his visa for the United States for three months before he left Pakistan. Moreover, since it is the well publicized events of September 11, 2001 that purportedly made it inhospitable for the Applicant to make a claim in the United States, it is particularly implausible that he would have made no inquiries whatsoever, of his own friends even, of how refugee claimants like himself might fare in that country before going there.
