The other significant reason why the Board refused the claim was that it did not believe the Applicant had the profile of someone at risk. The Board found it implausible that the Applicant had been targeted rather than other active members of the TNFJ or the executive of the Iman Bargah.

He was the one collecting donations for the Iman Bargah, and he was recognizable by the badge and the receipt book that he carried.
