The Board also found it implausible that Sipah-e-Sahaba attacked the Applicant and his brother rather than their father, who had been their target six years earlier. However, the Applicant explained in his hearing that by the time his own persecution began, his father was no longer religiously active and visible in the Shia community. At the same time, the Applicant became very active and visible, particularly in his Imam Bargah, throughout the years immediately leading to his persecution. As a result, he became a target of the Sipah-e-Sahaba while his father was no longer of any interest to them as he was not seen as a religious or ideological 'threat'.
