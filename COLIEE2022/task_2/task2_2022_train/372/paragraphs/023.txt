The Applicant says that the Board, in not considering the documentary evidence led by counsel at the hearing, has ignored relevant evidence on the record, in its determination that the Applicant does not have good grounds for fearing persecution. This failure is a reviewable error, as Mahoney J.A. stated in Owusu-Ansah at p. 113):
The failure to take account of material evidence has been variously characterised by this Court in allowing Section 28 applications. In Toro v. Canada, my brother Herald for the Court, said: It appears therefore that the Board in making its' decision has not had regard to the totality of the evidence properly before it. It has therefore erred in law.
