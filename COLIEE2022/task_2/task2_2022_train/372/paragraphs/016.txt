The Board found it implausible that Sipah-e-Sahaba did not kill the Applicant when they had the opportunity to do so during an attack when he was hit with the butt of a pistol. However, as the Applicant testified, he was threatened during the attack. His assailants wanted to "teach him a lesson." The Applicant saw this as a final warning. It was reasonable for him to leave at this time to prevent the threat from being carried out. The Board's negative inference was unreasonable.
