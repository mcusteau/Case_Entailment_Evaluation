  This is just as true if the respondent can prove a turbulent employment relationship. He would then also have to show that the employer's reliance on s. 29 is contrived. [see footnote 11] While such evidence cannot be excluded at the conceptual level, it is hard to imagine how the respondent would be able to establish it. Nonetheless, since this is the hypothesis adopted by the Adjudicator for the purposes of her decision and since the possibility it confirms cannot be entirely ruled out, I consider myself bound by it for the purposes of this judicial review. I must therefore find that the Adjudicator was right to assume jurisdiction subject to the respondent's ability to prove his assertion.
