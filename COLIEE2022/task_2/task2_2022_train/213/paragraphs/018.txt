  However, I must say that the hypothesis adopted by the Adjudicator is not likely to be easy to prove. The respondent's assertion that he can prove his employment was not terminated under the  
 Public Service Employment Act 
  when the employer is relying on s. 29 of that  
 Act 
  is far from obvious. A reorganisation under s. 29(1) takes place when restraint measures (which are easily proven) result in the abolishment of positions (which are once again easily proven). If the reorganization that results in the abolishment is not challenged and/or a de facto abolishment of positions occurs, it is hard to imagine how the resulting lay-offs can have been effected otherwise than as a result of the discontinuance of functions within the meaning of s. 29.
