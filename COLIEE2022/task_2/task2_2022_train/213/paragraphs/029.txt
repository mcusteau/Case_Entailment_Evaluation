  When considered in combination with the first grievance, this one leaves no doubt as to the respondent's exact position in the case at bar. In his opinion, both the abolishment of his position and his lay-off constituted disciplinary action taken by the employer without justification and unlawfully. Accordingly, it cannot be said that the respondent's employer was not given sufficient notice of the nature of his grievance in the course of the conciliation process or that he so altered his grievance at adjudication as to change its nature and make it a new grievance.
