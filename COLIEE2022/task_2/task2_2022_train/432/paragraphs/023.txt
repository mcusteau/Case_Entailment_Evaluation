I do not find this submitted new evidence justifies any change in any of the Registrar's conclusions with respect to the individual surrounding circumstances relevant to assessing the likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue. This new evidence, in my view, does not much more than confirm what was found and considered by the Registrar himself, namely that the respondent "often employs its trademark HUGO BOSS in conjunction with and subsidiary to its trademark BOSS". Moreover, this new evidence does certainly not discredit the inference drawn by the Registrar that the appellant's wares "might well be identified by a salesman as being HUGO suits ...".
