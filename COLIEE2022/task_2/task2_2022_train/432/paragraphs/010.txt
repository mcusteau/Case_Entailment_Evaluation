With respect to the surrounding circumstances specified in s. 6(5)(a) of the
Act
, the Registrar stated that both the appellant's mark VICTOR HUGO & Design and the respondent's mark HUGO BOSS are inherently weak since both marks would be perceived by the average Canadian consumer as being the name of a person. He also held that there had been fairly extensive use of the trademark HUGO BOSS in Canada in association with men's clothing and that the trademark HUGO BOSS had become known to some extent in Canada as of the material date (the appellant's application date). In contrast, the appellant's trademark had not become known at all in Canada as of the filing date given that it did not commence using its trademark until after filing its proposed use application.
