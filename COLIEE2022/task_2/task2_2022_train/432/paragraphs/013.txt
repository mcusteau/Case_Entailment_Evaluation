Finally, with respect to the issue of actual confusion as set out in the Mendes and Ribeiro affidavits, to which the second affidavit of Marvin Tkatch and the affidavits of Jack Korman were submitted to the Registrar in rebuttal, the Registrar found it impossible to determine whose evidence was more credible and indicated that he was far from certain whether the events as related by the respondent's affiants constituted evidence of actual confusion between the trademarks at issue. In fact, I am of the view that the issue of actual confusion could not be relevant to the Registrar's determination of the opposition ground of prior entitlement based on s. 16(3) of the
Act
because at the material date, which is the filing date of the appellant's application, there could not have been any instances of actual confusion involving the appellant's trademark at issue given it had not then yet been used. However, the following inferences drawn by the Registrar with respect to "the potential nature of the trade relating to the purchase of suits" could well constitute relevant surrounding circumstances within the meaning of s. 6(5) of the
Act
:
"The events relating to the instances of actual confusion do indicate the potential nature of the trade relating to the purchase of suits in that Mr. Korman would remove suits from the rack for his customers to try on, such that the customer may not necessarily notice or otherwise carefully check the labels on the suit prior to its purchase. That being the case, the applicant's wares might well be identified by a salesman as being HUGO suits, as opposed to VICTOR HUGO suits, which could result in a consumer being confused and particularly so when he is in a retail establishment which is also selling HUGO BOSS suits."
