It is undisputed that the ground of prior entitlement based on s. 16(3) of the
Act
needed to be decided on the issue of confusion between the trademarks VICTOR HUGO & Design and HUGO BOSS. The Registrar began his analysis of the ground in question by stating the following well-established [see footnote 3] and relevant principles:
"... In accordance with the clear wording of section 16(3) of the
Act
, the material time for considering the circumstances respecting this issue is as of the applicant's filing date. Furthermore, the onus or legal burden is on the applicant to establish that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue. Finally, in applying the test for confusion set forth in section 6(2) of the
Trade-marks Act
, consideration is to be given to all of the surrounding circumstances including those specifically set forth in section 6(5) [see footnote 4] of the
Act
."
