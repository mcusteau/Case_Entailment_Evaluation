[3]
The respondent opposed the application on March 21, 1988 on the grounds that:
(a) the trademark was not registrable in that it was confusing with trademark registration no. 253,272 for HUGO BOSS & Design owned by the respondent;
(b) the appellant was not the person entitled to registration because as of the filing date of its application the trademark was confusing with the trademark HUGO BOSS previously used in Canada by the respondent in association with "men's clothing, including pants, jackets, suits, vests and coats"; and
(c) the trademark VICTOR HUGO & Design was not distinctive of the wares of the appellant because it did not actually distinguish, nor was it adapted to distinguish, the appellant's wares from those of the respondent.
