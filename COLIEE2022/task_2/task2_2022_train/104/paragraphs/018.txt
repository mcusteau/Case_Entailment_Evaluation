  Considering the significance of this issue in the Officer's mind and final determination, it was incumbent upon the Officer to at least raise this issue or disclose the gist of the CBSA report. This was not done. Having failed to do so, I find that the Officer breached procedural fairness. The Applicant had no meaningful way to respond to the Officer's specific concerns. At the end of the day, there was no level playing field.
