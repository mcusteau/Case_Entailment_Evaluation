  The Respondent argues that, on the facts of this case, it was not necessary to disclose the CBSA report. The Applicant failed to satisfy the Officer that the transactions listed in the fairness letter were legitimate. As such, regardless of whether the CBSA report was disclosed, the Applicant would have still been found inadmissible. Furthermore, at the time, the CBSA report was classified as secret. The Responded relies on  
 Au v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2001 FCT 243, 202 F.T.R. 57 to argue that there is no breach of procedural fairness if an applicant is given the opportunity to respond to concerns raised in an officer's mind (at para. 33).
