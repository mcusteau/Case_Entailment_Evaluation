The requirements of s. 27(2)(c) of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978, are not to be considered in a vacuum. The question of the necessity of an interpreter is for the purpose of an immigration hearing. And that is the context in which the necessary inquiry should be conducted. In my opinion, it was necessary for the adjudicator to conduct at least a brief dialogue with the applicant about some of the factual and legal issues to be dealt with at the credible basis hearing in order for the adjudicator to make an informed decision as to whether the applicant could, for purposes of the hearing, understand and communicate in English. I do not suggest that an inquiry into an applicant's ability to understand and communicate in English should be conducted according to a rigid formula with a specific number of questions to be asked. It is not a voir dire. The conduct of the inquiry should be left to the discretion of the adjudicator or other officer conducting the inquiry. As with many aspects of procedural fairness, reasonableness is the standard. As long as an inquiry is one in which information is elicited that would be relevant to the question of whether an applicant is able to understand and communicate in English (or French), in the context of the hearing to be held, the test of reasonableness would be met. Although the adjudicator asked a number of questions relating to the applicant's schooling, work and other matters, it is the subject matter of the credible basis hearing that must be understood and communicated by the applicant. In my view, some dialogue about the relevant issues was necessary in order for the adjudicator to make the decision whether or not an interpreter was necessary.
