The issue in this case is whether the adjudicator in the credible basis proceeding erred in refusing the applicant the services of an interpreter. Section 27(2)(c) of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978, SOR/78-172, as amended, states:
"27(2) Subject to subsection (1) and before any evidence is presented at the inquiry, the adjudicator shall satisfy himself that
(c) the person concerned is able to understand and communicate in the language in which the inquiry is being held."
