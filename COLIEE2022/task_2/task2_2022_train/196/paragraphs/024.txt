 Brychka v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1998), 141 F.T.R. 258 (T.D.), MacKay, J., summarized the Board's choices at paragraphs 20 and 25: 
 
 
 
 "I agree with the respondent that the Board may reject medical evidence  
 when it has before it 
  contradictory medical evidence. ... 
 
 
 
 "As in  
 Moar 
 , the Board was obliged, in my view, to make an explicit finding that this medical evidence in support of the applicant's claim was not credible, or to solicit its own medical evidence dealing with the issue of a stress etiology, or to accept the uncontradicted evidence of the applicant in rendering its decision bearing in mind ss. 3 and 39 of the  
 VRABA 
 ." (Emphasis added)
