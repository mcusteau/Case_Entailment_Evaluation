  It is obviously not my intention to determine which opinion is well founded in this case. That is entirely for the Board to determine based on all the evidence before it. In this case, the Board rejected Dr. Sestier's opinion for the reasons set out in its decision. As previously mentioned, the issue is whether the Board erred in drawing the conclusion it did. In my view, the Board effectively committed an error that justifies this court's intervention.
