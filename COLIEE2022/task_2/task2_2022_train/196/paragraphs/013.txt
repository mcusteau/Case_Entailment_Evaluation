  The applicant claimed that the Board's decision was based on erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it. He further claimed that the Board arbitrarily rejected the article published in  
 Circulation 
  on which Dr. Sestier's report was based and failed to give it proper consideration. Moreover, the Board erroneously concluded that the study in the article had not been integrated in recognized medical literature nor in medical reference books without having considered the article's scientific value. The applicant also submitted that the Board had unjustifiably established that Dr. Sestier's uncontradicted opinion was not representative of the medical consensus on that issue. According to the applicant, the Board also disregarded the fact that Dr. Sestier's opinion had been corroborated by Dr. Voyer's medical expertise.
