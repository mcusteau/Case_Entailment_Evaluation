  There is no doubt that it is the Board's duty to assess the evidence before it and to give it the appropriate weight. However, the evidence must always be assessed in accordance with ss. 3 and 39 of the

 Brychka 
 , supra, cited above, the contradictory medical evidence must have been adduced in the file.
