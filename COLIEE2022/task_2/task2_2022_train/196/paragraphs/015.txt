  The respondent's first argument was that the applicable standard of review in this case should be patent unreasonableness ( 
 MacDonald v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1999), 164 F.T.R. 42 (T.D.), at para. 21). Therefore, this court's intervention is only warranted if the applicant succeeds in establishing that the Board's decision contains an error of law or is so unreasonable, arbitrary or absurd that it disregards the material before it ( 
 Hall v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1998), 152 F.T.R. 58 (T.D.);  
 Hunt v. Canada (Minister of Veterans Affairs) 
  (1998), 145 F.T.R. 96 (T.D.), at para. 8).
