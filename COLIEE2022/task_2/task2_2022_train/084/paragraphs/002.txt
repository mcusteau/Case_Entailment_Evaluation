  The Applicant would have met the requirements had the visa officer recognized that the Applicant had a brother who was a Canadian citizen living in Canada. This would have provided him with the five additional points he needed for his application to be accepted. The visa officer did not accept a sworn statement made by the Applicant's brother in Toronto and submitted in support of the application as sufficient evidence of the brother actually living in Canada. The visa officer did not reconsider his decision when requested to do so by the Applicant shortly after he received the visa officer's decision. The issue raised by the Applicant is if procedural fairness has been breached in this case.
