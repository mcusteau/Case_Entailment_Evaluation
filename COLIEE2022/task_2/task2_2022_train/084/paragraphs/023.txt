  However, here the arguments put forward by the Applicant concern issues related to natural justice and procedural fairness. As a general rule, issues of natural justice and procedural fairness are to be reviewed on the basis of a correctness standard:  
 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa 
 , [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339 at para. 43. As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Skechley v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , 2005 FCA 404, [2005] F.C.J. No.2056 (QL) at para. 53: 
 
 
 
 CUPE [ 
 Canadian Union of Public Employees v. Ontario (Minister of Labour) 
 , [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539, 2003 SCC 29] directs a court, when reviewing a decision challenged on the grounds of procedural fairness, to isolate any act or omission relevant to procedural fairness (at para. 100). This procedural fairness element is reviewed as a question of law. No deference is due. The decision-maker has either complied with the content of the duty of fairness appropriate for the particular circumstances, or has breached this duty.
