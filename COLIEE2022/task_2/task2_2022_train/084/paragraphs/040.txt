  In  
 Kurukkal 
  a question was certified on the issue of functus officio but has yet to be addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal. Until and unless the Federal Court of Appeal makes another determination on the matter, the law as stated by Justice Mactavish in  
 Kurrukkal 
  stands and, as a matter of judicial comity, I intend to follow her ruling.
