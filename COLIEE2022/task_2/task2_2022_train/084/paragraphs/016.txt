  The Respondent answers that determinations of facts related to the residency of family members in Canada for the purpose of allocating points under the federal skilled worker class are the responsibility of the visa officers. Moreover, it is open for visa officers to seek documentation other than statutory declarations to establish such facts. In this case, the Applicant was notified in writing that a statutory declaration would not suffice, and he either neglected or chose not to follow these instructions. In these circumstances, it was reasonable for the visa officer not to consider the statutory declaration as sufficient proof.
