  The function of this Court is to judicially control through judicial review the decision of the visa officer in this case, and not to act as a substitute visa officer. As noted above, the visa officer's decision not to treat the brother's affidavit as sufficient proof of certain facts was reasonable and did not breach any principle of procedural fairness. Furthermore, in light of the fact that none of the supplementary documentation alleged to have been provided to the visa officer with the request for reconsideration appears to have been effectively received by the visa officer, no error can be found with the visa officer's lack of responsiveness to that request.
