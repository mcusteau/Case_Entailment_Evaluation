  Only 4 points were attributed for adaptability out of a possible maximum of 10 points. In the adaptability category, no points were attributed to the Applicant for family relationship in Canada, even though the Applicant stated that he had a brother who was a Canadian citizen living in Canada. If this family relationship would have been taken into consideration, 5 points would have been added to the Applicant's score allowing him to have a total of 70 points and thus rendering him eligible to qualify for permanent residence. The November 2008 notes from the visa officer concerning his decision include the following explanation: 
 
 
 
 Applicant states to have brother in Canada. He has provided proof of relationship and also Canadian passport of stated brother. However, though specifically requested on our IRPA letter, applicant failed to provide any proof of family relation's residency in Canada. A statutory declaration is not/not (sic) sufficient for this purpose. Therefore, I am not satisfied with the documentation submitted that applicant has a family relation in Canada. I am awarding 0 point for family relationship in Canada.
