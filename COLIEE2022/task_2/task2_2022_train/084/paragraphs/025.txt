  As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)

 What is required by the duty of fairness - and therefore the principles of fundamental justice - is that the issue at hand be decided in the context of the statute involved and the rights affected:  
 Baker 
 , supra, at para. 21;  
 Knight v. Indian Head School Division No. 19 
 , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 653, at p. 682;  
 Old St. Boniface Residents Assn. Inc. v. Winnipeg (City) 
 , [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1170,  
 per 
  Sopinka J. More specifically, deciding what procedural protections must be provided involves consideration of the following factors: (1) the nature of the decision made and the procedures followed in making it, that is, "the closeness of the administrative process to the judicial process"; (2) the role of the particular decision within the statutory scheme; (3) the importance of the decision to the individual affected; (4) the legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision where undertakings were made concerning the procedure to be followed; and (5) the choice of procedure made by the agency itself:  
 Baker 
 , supra, at paras. 23-27. This is not to say that other factors or considerations may not be involved. This list of factors is non-exhaustive in determining the common law duty of fairness:  
 Baker 
 , supra, at para. 28. It must necessarily be so in determining the procedures demanded by the principles of fundamental justice.
