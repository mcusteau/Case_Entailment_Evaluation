 [43] 
  The decision of Justice Rothstein in  
 Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , (1998), 152 F.T.R. 316, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1239 (QL), at para. 4, is instructive of the principle applicable in the circumstances at hand here: 
 
 
 
 A visa officer may inquire further if he or she considers a further inquiry is warranted. Obviously, a visa officer cannot be wilfully blind in assessing an application and must act in good faith. However, there is no general obligation on a visa officer to make further inquiries when an application is ambiguous. The onus is on an applicant to file a clear application together with such supporting documentation as he or she considers advisable. The onus does not shift to the visa officer and there is no entitlement to a personal interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included. 
 
 
 
 Also see  
 Pacheco Silva v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 733, at para. 20. Though these decisions were rendered in the context of judicial review applications seeking visa officers to call for interviews of applicants in circumstances where the documentation provided was deficient, I am of the view that the reasoning of Justice Rothstein in  
 Lam 
  above also applies to requests for reconsideration of a visa officer's decision.
