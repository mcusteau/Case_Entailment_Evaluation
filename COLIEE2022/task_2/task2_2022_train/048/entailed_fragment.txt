In the present motion, the respondents have given the Court no indication of what specific information is to be treated as confidential, requesting only "sealing the disk of redacted public documents, filed by the Attorney General as Exhibit 1 to the Affidavit of Pamela Dawson" and that they file a "further-redacted version of those documents within 60 days." This request for a confidentiality order is, in my view, not tailored to the information that must be kept confidential
