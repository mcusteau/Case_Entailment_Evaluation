  On an examination of the document in question, I am prepared to draw the inference that it was an instruction by the client to Mr. Burnett, a conclusion that is supported both on the basis of what it says, and by comparing it with entries in the trust ledger. I hold, therefore, that it is a communication covered by solicitor-client privilege.
