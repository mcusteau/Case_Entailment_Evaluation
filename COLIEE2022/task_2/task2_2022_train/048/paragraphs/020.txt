  At the end of the hearing, a question arose between counsel about the scope of the confidentiality of these proceedings in view of their "in camera" nature. Because of the strong commitment to openness in the administration of justice, it is my view that the blanket of confidentiality should only cover that information for the protection of which the proceeding is required by s. 232(5) to be held "in camera".
