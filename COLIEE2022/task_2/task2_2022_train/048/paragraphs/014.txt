  Mr. Hansen relied on  
 Taves v. Canada 
 , [1995] 2 C.T.C. 347 (B.C.S.C.) where Baker, J., held that a cheque requisition by a law firm was covered by professional privilege and was not included in the "accounting record" exception. In view of the fact that this is a decision of the British Columbia Supreme Court, and the case at bar is a proceeding arising in that Province, I would usually regard such a clear pronouncement as dispositive, even though if I were sitting as a judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia it would not be binding on me.
