There is far more substance to the Crown's argument that it should receive costs because it succeeded on the reference. Clearly, Justice MacKay rejected much of Mr. Oberlander's evidence as being implausible or incredible. He also made an unequivocal finding on the critical fact that citizenship had been obtained by false representation or concealment of material facts. However, I cannot overlook the fact, even though it was not and could not be known to Justice MacKay at the time of his decision, that the Court of Appeal found that decision to have been ineffective for the only purpose for which it could have been sought, namely the revocation of Mr. Oberlander's citizenship. In my view, when a court is called upon, as I am, to make a determination based upon facts which have long since passed into history, it must not blind itself to subsequent events which colour or even change entirely the interpretation of such facts. To take two very different examples, that is the case with the death or unexpected total recovery of an injured plaintiff or the reversal of a long-standing rule of law by the ultimate appellate court. Lawyers and judges do themselves no favour by closing their eyes to reality and insisting on the validity of demonstrably untrue legal fictions. That is what I would call the government's present claim that it was the clear winner on the reference. Justice MacKay being no longer able to act, I must exercise my own discretion in the matter of costs on the facts and the record as they are now.
