I conclude from the foregoing that even though the government may be considered to have enjoyed some success on the reference to Justice MacKay, that success was incomplete and the victory, if it was one, may ultimately turn out to have been only pyrrhic. This is not a case of merely partial success, calling for the application of the doctrine enunciated in the
Sunrise Co. v. Ship Lake Winnipeg
, [1988] F.C.J. No. 1009; 96 N.R. 310 (F.C.A.) rather it is a case of a victory which is contingent upon an eventuality which, even if it should come to pass, will require something more to have been done by the "victor".
