The brutal fact is that we now know that Justice MacKay's decision could not, as it stood and without more, form the basis of a revocation decision by the Governor in Council. He made a specific and unchallengeable decision that Mr. Oberlander had not been shown to be an accomplice in the sense of the criminal law of Canada. He made no finding that Mr. Oberlander was or had been "complicit" in war crimes in the sense (possibly different, but that decision is not mine to make) attributed to that word by the war crimes policy. Furthermore, he did not find, although as Justice DÃ©cary said "he might have" that his unit, Ek 10a, was an organization with a "single brutal purpose". If the government is to be successful in achieving the revocation of Mr. Oberlander's citizenship on the remit by the Court of Appeal to the Governor in Council the latter will have to make such a finding on its own; as I understand it, that could only be on the introduction of new materials which are not to be found within the four corners of Justice MacKay's decision. I do not have to decide whether it is open to the government to place new evidence before the Governor in Council.
