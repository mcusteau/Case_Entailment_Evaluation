[11]
If I correctly understand this judgment, the Court of Appeal decided to set aside the decision of the Governor in Council for two reasons: first, that no proper consideration had been given to Mr. Oberlander's "personal interests"; and second, that, Justice MacKay having specifically denied Mr. Oberlander's complicity in war crimes in the criminal sense of that term, there was no finding by him and no material upon which the Governor in Council could make the necessary finding that Mr. Oberlander fell within the terms of the government's war crimes policy. Such a finding, if I understand the Court's reasons properly, would have in turn required a finding that Ek 10a was a unit with a "single brutal purpose" so as to bring Mr. Oberlander within that policy's extended definition of the word "complicit".
