A bill of costs has been submitted for some $47,000 allegedly based on Tariff B. In my view many of the items claimed do not relate to the legal proceedings connected with the judicial review application but with other matters such as applications to stay deportation orders and the like. Government counsel has indicated, however, that they consider that a sum of $40,000 "all in" would not be unreasonable and, while I think that the figure is generous and probably higher than what would be obtained on any regular assessment of party and party costs, I would give effect to this concession and make an order accordingly.
