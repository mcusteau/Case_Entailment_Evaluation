This too leads to a nonsensical result. In this scenario, the same candidate would have received 15 points, one point more, if he or she were simply assessed on the basis of a one-year credential and 13 years, as provided in s. 78(2)(c). It would be an absurd result if an applicant were to receive fewer points than another applicant with the same years of study
because
his or her credential included an additional year. Such a result effectively penalizes an applicant for having higher educational credentials. The legislators could not have intended such a result.
