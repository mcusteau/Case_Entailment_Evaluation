Here, the officer failed to make a decision on whether or not to exercise his or her discretion to consider the new evidence in light of the relevant circumstances; rather, the officer unequivocally stated that "Any new information that you have submitted
cannot
now be considered, as your application was finally refused on 3 June 2010." In so finding, the officer fettered his or her discretion. It is clear from the jurisprudence that the officer did in fact have the ability to consider the new evidence. Here, the officer was operating under the mistaken assumption that he or she was not able to consider the new evidence. This is a second ground for allowing this application.
