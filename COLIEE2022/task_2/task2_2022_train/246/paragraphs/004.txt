When his application was refused in June 2010, Mr. Marr immediately provided the respondent with a copy of the letter establishing that he had apprenticed as a baker and requested a reconsideration of the decision. Apparently he thought that he had submitted the letter with his application. He now knows that he did not do so. The officer denied the applicant's request for reconsideration by letter dated June 29, 2010, stating "Any new information that you have submitted cannot now be considered, as your application was finally refused on 3 June 2010." The officer suggested that Mr. Marr, after having waited three years to have his application determined, file a new application with this additional information. If the letter had been included in his original application, Mr. Marr would have had a sufficient number of points to be granted the permanent resident visa.
