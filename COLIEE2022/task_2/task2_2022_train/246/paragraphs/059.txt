[59]
In light of the conflicting jurisprudence as to the interpretation of s. 78(4) of the
Regulations
, the applicant proposed that the Court certify the same question that was certified in
Thomasz
. The respondent stated that it was not opposed to the certification of that question. That question is as follows:
When a skilled worker visa applicant has achieved an educational credential referred to in a particular subparagraph in Regulation 78(2) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 but not the total number of years of study required by that subparagraph, does section 78(4) require the visa officers to award the number of points based on the applicant's highest educational credential or based on the applicant's years of study?
