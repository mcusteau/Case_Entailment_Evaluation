[38]
With the greatest of respect for the view of these learned Judges, I cannot agree. In my view, the
Bhuiya
interpretation leads to an absurdity, not on the facts present in any of those cases, but when one examines another situation that might arise under s. 78. In
Bhuiya
,
Kabir
,
Khan
, and
Thomasz
the applicants had significant educational credentials. In none of those cases was an applicant being considered who had only a one-year post-secondary educational credential other than a university educational credential but less than 12 years of study. It is in this scenario where the
Bhuiya
interpretation of s. 78(4) fails.
