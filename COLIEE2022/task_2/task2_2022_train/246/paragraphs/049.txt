[49]
This Court has held that the doctrine of functus officio does not apply to decisions regarding applications to remain in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds:
Kurukkal v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2009 FC 695. It is submitted by Mr. Marr that the Court's reasoning in
Kurukkal
recognized the need to encourage flexible decision-making and informality in the non-judicial or tribunal context, and Mr. Marr argues that these same principles ought to apply in skilled worker decisions. He says that he raised the issue of the apprenticeship in his application and that it was incumbent on the officer to at least look at the letter he later submitted rather than merely state that it could not be considered.
