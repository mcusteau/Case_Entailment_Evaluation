The
Bhuiya
interpretation directs officers to look to years of study, not the credential. The paragraph that most closely approximates our clever young Scot is s. 78(2)(b), but he is shy one year of study. Subsection 78(4) expressly provides that it applies if an applicant has "an educational credential referred to in paragraph (2)(b)," which our clever lad has, and then goes on to say that he is to be "awarded the same number of points as the number of years of completed full-time" studies. Under the
Bhuiya
interpretation, what points is he to be awarded? There is no provision that corresponds to 11 years of study. It makes no sense for him to be awarded no points merely because he is bright and has completed his education sooner than the norm. Equally, it makes no sense to suggest that he receive the five points provided for in s. 78(2)(a) for a secondary school education because that paragraph has no reference to number of years of studies, which is precisely what s. 78(4) says we are to look to.
