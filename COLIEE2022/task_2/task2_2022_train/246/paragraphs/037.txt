Justice Mactavish in
Bhuiya
held that s. 78(4) requires that where an applicant has an educational credential but not the associated years of studies, an officer shall award the number of points set out in the subsection in which the applicant does have the required years of study, not the full points that would otherwise correspond to his or her educational credential. One does not award the full points for the educational credential absent the years of study. This interpretation and approach was followed by Justice Heneghan in
Kabir
and
Khan
and in
Thomasz v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2010 FC 1159.
