One of the central issues in this application is the interpretation of s. 78 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (
Regulations
), which deals with the points to be awarded to applicants for their educational accomplishments. This section of the
Regulations
has been the subject of significant previous judicial consideration. It is not clearly written. Justice Campbell in
Hasan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2010 FC 1206, at para. 18, commented: "In my opinion, the lack of clarity in [s. 78 of] the
Regulations
has caused visa officers to adopt a self-help approach."
