The applicant notes that in response to question 10 of the IMM 0008 Schedule 1, he indicated that he had three years of "trade school or other post secondary education" in addition to the 11 years of education for which the officer gave him credit. Further, he points out that at question 11 of that schedule, which requests details of personal history since age 18, he noted that he was an apprentice baker from July 1979 to March 1981. This is one year less than the three years of apprenticeship as he started the apprenticeship when he was only 17 and the question relates to the period after age 18.
