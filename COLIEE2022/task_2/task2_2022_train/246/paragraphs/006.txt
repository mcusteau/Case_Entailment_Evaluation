Section 76(3) of the
Regulations
permits an officer to substitute his or her evaluation of the likelihood of an applicant becoming economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada. In the applicant's case, the officer noted: "I have determined that the points that you have been awarded are an accurate reflection of the likelihood of your ability to become economically established in Canada."
