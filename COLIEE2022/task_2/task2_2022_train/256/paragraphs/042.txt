"At paragraph 28, there's a summary of the documents that the visa officer noted that the applicant had not provided. There's four documents. There was no letter of employment or banking history from the applicant's parents. There was no family composition form completed by the applicant's parents. There was no information regarding the financial ability of her family to support her studies in Canada and there was no evidence of the relationship between the applicant and her 'cousin'"

"Now, in referring to the certificate of relationship, this is the one that, the notarized certificate that stated that Chen Bixim was the cousin of the applicant. The visa officer did not accept this as evidence of a relationship between the applicant and her sponsor, and this finding, in my submission, was reasonably open to the visa officer.... on it's face, the document is suspect. It does not indicate how the applicant was related to Chen Bixim or indeed, how the notary would be able to know that information.
"And further the visa officer was unable to determine whether the applicant was related or was the cousin of Chen Bixim through other documentation that could have been submitted in the application such as the family composition or details of education and employment form, which is a requirement of the kit."
