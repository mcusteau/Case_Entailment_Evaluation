The CIC manual also states that in considering the intentions of applicants for student visas to Canada, visa officers should consider only whether or not they are likely to remain in Canada illegally upon the expiration of the visa, and not whether they are likely to become immigrants:
"Section 4.6.1
Applicants have the burden of proving to your satisfaction that they are bona fide visitors. However, in the case of foreign students, the general question of bona fides is not so much whether the applicant is a prospective immigrant, but whether the applicant is a prospective illegal immigrant."
