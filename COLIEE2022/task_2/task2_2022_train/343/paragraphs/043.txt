Canning does not meet the test for a stay of McKeil's action in this court until Canning's action in this court is determined. First, Canning's motion is basically a mirror of its motion for consolidation which has not met with success.

(b) Stay the McKeil action until the Tripap action in Quebec Superior Court is heard
