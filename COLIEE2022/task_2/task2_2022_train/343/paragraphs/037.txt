In the circumstances of Canning's motion for consolidation, a decision on severance is inappropriate at this time for the following reasons. First, I consider severance as an alternative to McKeil's objections on Canning's consolidation motion and I have refused Canning's motion to consolidate the two actions; second, the issue of severance is best dealt with after discoveries have been held and the actions are ripe for hearing; third, without basing my decision on this point, I am of the view that it would have been appropriate for McKeil to seek an order for severance in a separate motion rather than in a reply to Canning's motion to consolidate.
