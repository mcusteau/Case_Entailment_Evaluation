Canning's motion for a stay of the McKeil action until the Tripap action is determined in the Quebec Superior Court, cannot succeed. In order for s. 50(1)(a) of the
Federal Court Act
to apply, McKeil's action in this court must be identical or closely resemble in its essential elements the Tripap action in the Quebec Superior Court. (See
Fruit of the Loom Inc. v. Chateau Lingerie Manufacturing Co.
(1984), 79 C.P.R.(2d) 274 (F.C.T.D.)) Clearly, this is not the situation before me. McKeil is not a party in the Tripap action and McKeil's claim in this court against Canning is fundamentally different than the Tripap claim against Canning in the Quebec Superior Court.
