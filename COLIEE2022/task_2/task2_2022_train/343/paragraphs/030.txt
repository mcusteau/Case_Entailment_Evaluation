There is no substantive commonality of legal and factual issues in the two actions. The McKeil action is a claim for breach of a transportation contract with Canning. Canning has, in defence and counterclaim, raised legal issues concerning contract scope, term, calculation of damages, repudiation, breach and frustration. McKeil, in reply, has raised force majeure. The Canning action against Tripap raises completely different issues. It relates to the supply of wood by Canning to Tripap, it focusses on Tripap's alleged unlawful termination and damages incurred by Canning.
