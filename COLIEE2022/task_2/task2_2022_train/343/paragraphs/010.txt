McKeil initiated the first proceeding by the filing of a statement of claim in this court naming Canning as a defendant. That statement of claim was issued on January 23, 1998, alleging unlawful termination of the transportation contract by Canning as well as breach of that contract in 1997 by Canning's failure to offer for carriage the minimum quantities of wood provided for in the contract.
