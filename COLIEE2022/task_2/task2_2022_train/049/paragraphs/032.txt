  Justice Gauthier recently dealt with the same argument in  
 Acosta 
 ,  
 supra 
 , in the context of bus operators, and held at para. 16 of her reasons that being a member of a particular economic sector does not transform generalized risk of criminal violence against the applicant to personal risk: 
 
 
 
 Â¶16  
 The applicant referred to a passage of the documentary evidence which confirms that bus fare collectors are frequently subject to extortion by the Gang. 
  However, the Board examined this country documentation and found it to clearly indicate the prevalence of gang related violence in a variety of sectors.  
 It is no more unreasonable to find that a particular group that is targeted, be it bus fare collectors or other victims of extortion and who do not pay, faces generalized violence than to reach the same conclusion in respect of well known wealthy business men in Haiti who were clearly found to be at a heightened risk of facing the violence prevalent in that country
