  In Kadenko, supra, the Federal Court of Appeal held that in order to rebut the presumption of state protection, refugee claimants must make "reasonable efforts" at seeking out state protection, and that the burden on the claimant increases where the state in question is democratic (see also  
 L.G.S. v. Canada (MCI) 
 . 2004 FC 731, per Justice Mactavish where she held at para. 22 that a claimant need not show that they exhausted absolutely all avenues of protection).
