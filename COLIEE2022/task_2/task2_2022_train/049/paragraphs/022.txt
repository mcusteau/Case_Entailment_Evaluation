 [22] 
  As a result of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in  
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9, [2008] S.C.J. No. 9 (QL), it is clear that reviewing courts must confine their analysis to two standards of review, those of reasonableness and correctness. Accordingly, the deference to be accorded to the Board's factual findings mandates that the issues in question be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness.
