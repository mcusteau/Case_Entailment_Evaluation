  In May 2006 the same gang returned and proceeded to extort the applicants in return for keeping the store open. The applicants were warned not to report the gang under pain of death. The applicants decided not to report the extortion to the police out of fear for their lives and dutifully paid the weekly extortion fee for about a month.
