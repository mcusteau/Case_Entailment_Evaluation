  As the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
  is silent on the question of judicial review, decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, a federal institution, are subject to judicial review in accordance with the provisions of section 18.1 of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended. Section 18.1 sets out a number of grounds of review, three of which may be relevant. The Federal Court may grant relief if satisfied that the Commission: 
 
 
 
 "18.1(4) 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 (b) failed to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural fairness or other procedure that it was required by law to observe; 
 
 
 
 (c) erred in law in making a decision or an order, whether or not the error appears on the face of the record; 
 
 
 
 (d) based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it;"
