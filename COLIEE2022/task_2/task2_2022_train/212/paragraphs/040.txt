  Turning more specifically to the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , a decision of the Commission to send a complaint to the Tribunal for full inquiry, after having earlier decided to dismiss the complaint, was dealt with in  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Human Rights Tribunal Panel (Can.) et al. 
  (1994), 76 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.). The Commission decided to further a complaint with respect to family allowance cheques. The Attorney General applied to quash that decision. It was argued that since the Attorney General was given all the material underlying the decision and an opportunity to comment thereon (as is the case here), the Commissioner's obligations had been met. Reed, J., disagreed. She said at page 12: 
 
 
 
 "I am not persuaded that this is so. I think the Department was entitled to a fuller explanation of the position which was being taken. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "In my view the Commission had an obligation, as a matter of fairness, to do so. I do not mean to suggest that the Commission could not change its mind and could not resile from the earlier agreement but I am of the view that the Commission should have made it clear to the applicant exactly in what respect it was resiling from its earlier decision, if it was, and why. The explanation might be no more than to say that the Commission thought it had made a mistake at the earlier time or had not adequately considered whatever factors it was which caused the change in position. But the Department is certainly entitled to know. Otherwise, in the context of this case, its ability to respond in a meaningful way is restricted."
