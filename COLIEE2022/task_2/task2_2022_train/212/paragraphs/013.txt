  Next came Heneghan, J.'s, order (206 F.T.R. 207; 2001 FCT 687). She held that the Commission had breached its duty of procedural fairness by not carrying out a thorough and neutral evaluation. More particularly, it failed to interview Dr. Vanier, a crucial witness who at one time had been the NRC's Director General, and who had control over Dr. Grover's work. She expressed the concern that a failure to interview a person vitally connected to the alleged discriminatory action may lead to the inference of pre-judgment by the investigator. Having thus found that the Commission had breached its duty of procedural fairness, she found it unnecessary to comment on whether the Commission had erred in making a finding that there was insufficient evidence to justify taking the complaints to the tribunal stage, or on the other submissions made by Dr. Grover in support of his application.
