 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , is intended to give effect, with respect to matters within Parliament's jurisdiction, to the principle that all individuals should have an opportunity to live the lives they wish unhindered by discriminatory practices based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted. A number of discriminatory practices are identified including the refusal to employ or to continue to employ or to differentiate adversely in relation to an employee on a prohibited ground of discrimination (section 7).
