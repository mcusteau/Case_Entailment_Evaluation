  Relying on  
 Hutchinson v. Canada (Minister of the Environment) 
  (2003), 302 N.R. 66; 2003 FCA 133, in which Pelletier, J.A., pre- 
 Dr. Q. 
  and  
 Ryan 
 , said a decision to dismiss a complaint after the investigation phase was entitled to a very high level of deference by the Court, counsel for Dr. Grover suggested that the test should be patent unreasonableness in situations where the Commission, in its discretion, decided to forward a case to the Tribunal. A negative decision would bring the complaint to an end, while the party against whom a complaint is lodged, in this case the employer, still has an opportunity to defend itself at a full inquiry. I am not convinced that this is so because under section 44 the same language is used with respect to dismissing a complaint or referring it on, i.e. "[h]aving regard to all the circumstances of the complaint ..." However, I refrain from pronouncing myself on that question as this case, in my opinion, turns on procedural fairness. No deference is owed unless the decision was correct ( 
 Gardiner 
 , supra; and  
 Ha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2004), 316 N.R. 299; 2004 FCA 49).
