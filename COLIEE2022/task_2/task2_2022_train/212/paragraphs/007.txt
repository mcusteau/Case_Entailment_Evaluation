  Dr. Grover, a research scientist, has been working for the NRC since 1981. He filed his first complaint, H30947, in 1987. The Commission referred it to the Tribunal which, as aforesaid, found in 1992 that the NRC had indeed discriminated against him on the basis of his race, colour and national origin. It ordered the NRC to appoint him to an appropriate position, provide a letter of apology, correct his employment records and pay a monetary award for hurt feelings. In its decision it found Dr. Grover to be credible. Certain NRC witnesses, including the said Dr. Vanier, were found not to be credible.
