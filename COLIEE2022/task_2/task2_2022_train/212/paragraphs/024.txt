 [24] 
  The Commission's original investigation of complaints H32471 and H32637 went into considerable detail. Apart from Dr. Grover's assertions that the Commission breached the principles of procedural justice and based its decision on an investigation which was neither neutral nor thorough, it was also argued that the investigation was conducted in bad faith and in an arbitrary manner, that the decision was rendered without regard to the evidence, that it was an improper exercise of discretion not to appoint a Tribunal and: 
 
 
 
 "Paragraph 32: Finally, the Applicant argues that the failure of the Commission to take into account the Tribunal decision regarding his earlier complaints in 1991 and 1992, which decision was delivered on August 21st, 1992, constitutes further evidence of a breach of procedural fairness towards the Applicant in relation to the complaints now at issue."
