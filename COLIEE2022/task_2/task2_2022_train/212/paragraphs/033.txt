  In exercising its powers of judicial review, the Federal Court, as any other Canadian court, is guided by principles of administrative law as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada. These principles were summarized in three decisions handed down last year:  
 Dr. Q., Re 
 , [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170; 2003 SCC 19;  
 Ryan v. Law Society of New Brunswick 
 , [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247; 302 N.R. 1; 257 N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207; 2003 SCC 20; and  
 Canadian Union of Public Employees et al. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour) 
 , [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539; 304 N.R. 76; 173 O.A.C. 38.  
 Dr. Q. 
 , and 
  Ryan 
 , which were handed down the same day, stand for the proposition that there are only three standards for judicial review of administrative decisions: correctness, reasonableness simpliciter, and patent unreasonableness. A pragmatic and functional approach is to be applied. The Court must weigh a number of factors in order to determine whether a particular issue should receive exacting review (correctness), undergo significant searching or testing (reasonableness simpliciter) or be left to the near-exclusive determination of the original decision-maker (patent unreasonableness). The reviewing court must take into account whether there is a privative clause or statutory right of appeal, the expertise of the underlying tribunal relative to that of the reviewing court, the purpose of the legislation in general and the provisions under review in particular, and the nature of the question: law, fact or mixed law and fact.
