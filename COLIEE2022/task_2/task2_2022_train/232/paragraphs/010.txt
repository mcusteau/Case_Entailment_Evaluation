In support of this application, counsel argues that the visa officer was unduly influenced by the telex from the CEIC or, in the alternative, if the telex contained appropriate criteria, were they irrelevant in the present case. It is also argued that the visa officer erred in failing to interview the applicant as to his actual teaching experience. Finally, counsel questions whether the Immigration Regulations require a self-employed applicant to have actual self-employed experience.
