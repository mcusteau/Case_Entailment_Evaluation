I am convinced that the visa officer interpreted the Regulations in such a narrow fashion as to render qualification virtually impossible and as a result, treated the applicant unfairly. The analysis appears to me to require consideration of three questions. First, is the applicant an accomplished musician (in which international recognition ought to be of great assistance)? Second, can he teach? Third, can he be self-employed as a teacher? It is obvious that the applicant was successful in the first two and by inference at least, somewhat successful in the third. His only apparent failure in respect to the third issue is the finding of a lack of actual experience as a self-employed teacher. By placing undue emphasis on the lack of experience as a self-employed teacher, the visa officer allowed that partial failure on the third issue to override success on the other two, an interpretation that made it almost impossible for this applicant to succeed. Accordingly, there has been a fundamental breach of the duty of fairness to this applicant which is sufficient to warrant the relief sought.
