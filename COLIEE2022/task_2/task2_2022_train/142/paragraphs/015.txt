  This conclusion that summary judgment is available on a reference under the  
 Act 
  is also supported by the recent decision of Mr. Justice Hugessen in  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Kawash 
 , [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 389; 2003 FCT 709 (T.D.), where summary judgment was granted in respect of such a reference.
