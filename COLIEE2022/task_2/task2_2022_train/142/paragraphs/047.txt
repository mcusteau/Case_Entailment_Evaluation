 [47] 
  Finally, the defendant relies upon the decision of this court in  
 Minhas 
 , supra, to argue that the Minister must establish that the defendant misrepresented pertinent facts with the intent to deceive and to obtain his citizenship on the basis of those false representations. In my view,  
 Minhas 
  is distinguishable. There is nothing in the reasons of the court to show that in that case Mr. Minhas did anything to deceive authorities. He simply did not volunteer that he had been charged with an offence. This is distinguishable from the present case because of the evidence that the defendant actively deceived authorities by providing a false blood sample to thwart the investigation and charging process.
