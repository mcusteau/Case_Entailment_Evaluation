  I have been persuaded by the submissions advanced on the Minster's behalf that in  
 Obodzinsky 
 , the Federal Court of Appeal did not find that summary judgment would never be available in the context of a revocation proceeding. In my view, the decision in  
 Obodzinsky 
  turned upon the fact that the motion for summary judgment was not heard by the judge assigned to the reference (notwithstanding that the reference was about to begin and a judge had been assigned to hear the reference), and the fact that, while on a reference the judge is to reach a conclusion upon factual issues, the judgment granted on a summary basis left unresolved the question of fact which was the subject matter of the reference. Thus, the Court of Appeal did not conclude that summary judgment would never be available in respect of a reference under the  
 Act 
 . Indeed, at paragraph 17 of the reasons the court assumed for purposes of discussion that recourse to summary judgment is not prohibited.
