  I respectfully disagree. I have taken the requisite "hard look" at the conflicting affidavits and am of the view that if this issue must be determined, that determination must occur after the parties are cross-examined under oath before the trier of fact. In my view, a genuine issue exists as to whether the defendant lied to the Citizenship Judge so as to obtain his citizenship by false representation.
