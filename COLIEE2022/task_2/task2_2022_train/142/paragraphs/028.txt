  As noted above, the defendant had also sworn an affidavit in this proceeding. In his affidavit the defendant takes significant issue with the Citizenship Judge's version of events. He swears that the Citizenship Judge did ask him if he "had any problems" with the R.C.M.P., and he asked her to clarify what she meant by that. She clarified the question to mean "have you been charged with any criminal offence?". He told her that he had not been charged with an offence, which was, at the time, true. The defendant denies being asked whether he was presently under any kind of criminal investigation.
