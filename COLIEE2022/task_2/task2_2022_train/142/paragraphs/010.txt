  The Minister asserts that during his interview with the Citizenship Judge, before the approval of his application for citizenship, the defendant was asked by the Citizenship Judge whether he had been under a past or present criminal investigation. The Minister further asserts that the defendant falsely represented that he was not under a criminal investigation. The Minister therefore says that the defendant obtained his citizenship by lying to the Citizenship Judge and by knowingly concealing material circumstances from both the Citizenship Judge and from the R.C.M.P. The Minister argues that on the uncontradicted evidence before the court, the facts do not raise a genuine issue for trial within the meaning of rule 216(1) of the  
 Federal Court Rules, 1998 
  (" 
 Rules 
 "). Alternatively, the Minister argues that if there is a genuine issue of law or a genuine issue with respect to a defence, the court should find on the whole of the uncontradicted evidence the facts necessary to decide the questions of fact and law and grant summary judgment pursuant to rule 216(3).
