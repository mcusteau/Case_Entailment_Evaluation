  This conclusion is consistent with the fact that rule 169(a) makes all of the provisions of Part 4 of the  
 Rules 
  applicable to references under section 18 of the  
 Act 
 . Part 4 of the  
 Rules 
  includes the rules applicable to summary judgment. It would not have been difficult to make Part 4 of the  
 Rules 
 , except for the summary judgment rules, applicable to those references if that had been the intent.
