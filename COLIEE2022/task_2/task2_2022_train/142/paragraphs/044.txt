 [44] 
  The Ontario Court of Appeal has held with respect to the predecessor of section 504 of the  
 Criminal Code 
  that: 
 
 
 
 "I am of the view that in s. 439 [the predecessor to section 504] the word 'receive' means that the Justice shall not reject a complaint which is in writing and which complies with the conditions set out in that section. The complaint or details of the alleged offence are reduced to writing and when sworn to by the Justice of the Peace constitute an information. On the swearing of the written complaint the information is 'laid' and becomes the first step or commencement of criminal proceedings." 
 
 
 
 See:  
 R. v. Southwick 
 , [1968] 1 C.C.C. 356 (Ont. C.A.).
