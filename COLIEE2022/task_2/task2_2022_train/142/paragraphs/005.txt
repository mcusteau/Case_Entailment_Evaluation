 [5] 
  On November 6, 1992, the defendant became aware that the victim of the sexual assault had made a complaint to the police. The defendant was interviewed by the R.C.M.P. on November 9, 1992. The defendant denied any involvement in the offences and attempted, in his words, to "clear himself" of the allegations and to avoid prosecution by providing a false blood sample to the police. He did so by surgically inserting into his arm a tube of someone else's blood. The false blood sample was taken from the tube on November 16, 1992. On January 25, 1993, the police received a negative DNA test result on the basis of a comparison of the false blood sample with a semen sample taken from the victim of the sexual assault.
