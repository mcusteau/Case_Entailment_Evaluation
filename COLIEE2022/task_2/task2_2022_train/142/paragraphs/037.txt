 [37] 
  I find on this evidence, as a fact, that by knowingly providing a false blood sample for the purpose of avoiding criminal prosecution, the defendant foreclosed at that time further inquiry by police officers. He also foreclosed being charged with the indictable offence of sexual assault in December of 1992. Sgt. Haanstra's evidence is uncontradicted that he had concluded that there were reasonable and probable grounds with which to charge the defendant. Sgt. Haanstra was dissuaded from doing so on December 21, 1992 because the defendant had provided a blood sample and Crown counsel had agreed with the defendant's counsel that no charge would be laid until the DNA test results were received. The defendant only agreed to provide a blood sample for testing because he knew it would not incriminate him. But for providing the false blood sample, the defendant would have been charged prior to February 5, 1993.
