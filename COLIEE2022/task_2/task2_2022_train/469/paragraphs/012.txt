If, after hearing from the person, the Officer is not persuaded to defer, a highlights report is sent to the Delegate for consideration.  Under ss 44(2), if the Delegate is of the opinion that the Officer’s report is well-founded, the report may be referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  Once again the word “may” is used.  Presumably this language also affords some discretion not to refer the matter to the ID.  Except in limited circumstances that do not apply to these cases, the Delegate is not authorized to issue a removal order.  Once the matter is in the hands of the ID, the process takes on a quasi-judicial character that includes a right to a hearing.  Unlike the language of s 44 of the IRPA, s 45 requires the ID to make a decision concerning admissibility.  It has several available options including the authority to recognize the right of a permanent resident to enter Canada or it can “make the applicable removal order”.  If the ID makes a removal order, it must be “satisfied” that the permanent resident is inadmissible.  In cases like these where the ID issues a removal order a right of appeal exists to the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD].  Unlike the ID, the IAD has the discretion to excuse a default based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations.
