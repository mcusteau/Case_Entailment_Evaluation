Mr. Wang was charged and convicted of 8 criminal counts under the IRPA, the Criminal Code, RSC, 1985, c C-46, and the Income Tax Act, RSC, 1985, c 1 (5th Supp).  In 2015 he was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and fined $900,000.  Needless to say, Mr. Wang’s misconduct led the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA] to reflect on the conduct of Mr. Wang’s clients and, in particular, whether they were inadmissible for misrepresentation under s 40 of the IRPA.  In a number of cases including these, the CBSA initiated the inadmissibility process under s 44 of the IRPA.  It is the reasonableness of those referrals that is the subject of all of these proceedings.
