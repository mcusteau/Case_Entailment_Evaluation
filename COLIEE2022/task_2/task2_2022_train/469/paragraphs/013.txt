The Applicants contend that, in their cases, the Officer and the Delegate were required to reflect on the validity of their arguments concerning an asserted abuse of process, their respective levels of complicity in Mr. Wang’s fraudulent activity and whether, on a correct interpretation of the IRPA, a misrepresentation made in support of an application to renew a permanent residency card can support an inadmissibility finding under s 40.  Among other points, the Applicants argue that, in order to properly exercise the discretion under s 44 of the IRPA not to refer their cases onward, the Officer and the Delegate must examine and resolve these complex issues before coming to their required opinions.  This is particularly the case, they say, for assessing the humanitarian and compassionate factors that they presented, unsworn, through their counsel (including credibility assessments) about their respective levels of awareness and complicity concerning the misconduct of Mr. Wang.  Although the Applicants appear to accept that a misrepresentation may be found in the absence of a fraudulent intent, they argue that the degree of a person’s culpability is still relevant to the exercise of humanitarian and compassionate discretion: see Applicant’s Memorandum in IMM-3358-18 at paras 76 and 78.
