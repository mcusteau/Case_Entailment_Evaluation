The Applicants’ counsel argued that the ID is unlikely to extend relief because its authority does not include the resolution of the issues he raised with the Officer and the Delegate.  That argument, however, unduly limits the ID’s jurisdiction.  For instance, if it can be proven that the minor dependants, Si Yi Yin and Si Man Yin, were not in control of their applications and had no knowledge of what was taking place, a misrepresentation finding arguably could not be made again them:  see Sidhu v Canada, 2019 FCA 169 at para 71.  Similarly, if an Applicant can establish that he or she took all available precautions to protect against the perpetration of a fraud, an inadmissibility finding may not be open.  The Applicants’ further statutory interpretation argument – complex though it may be – can also be put to the ID for consideration.  If what took place does not constitute a misrepresentation under s 40, it would obviously fall within the ID’s authority to decide.  It is also open to argument that the ID can consider an abuse of process argument based on an assertion that, in at least two of these cases, the CBSA was unfairly attempting to split its admissibility case into two parts (ie. residency followed by misrepresentation).  The only avenue that may not be available to the Applicants before the ID is recourse to the humanitarian and compassionate relief, but that would be available before the IAD.
