Although the Court in Cha, above, was careful to limit the application of its reasons to cases involving foreign nationals I cannot identify a rational basis to extend a more generous substantive discretion to permanent residents under s 44.  I accept that greater due process requirements may apply to permanent residents because they are at risk of losing their residency status.  However, unlike some provisions in the IRPA that grant heightened substantive rights to permanent residents, s 44 treats foreign nationals and permanent residents alike.  Accordingly, whatever the basis of inadmissibility may be, the discretion not to make a referral to the ID is the same for both classes.
