The preparation of an inadmissibility report under ss 44(1) of the IRPA requires only that an assigned Officer form an opinion that a permanent resident is inadmissible.  After forming such an opinion, the Officer is authorized to prepare a report setting out the relevant facts.  The use of the words “may prepare a report” has been held to connote some level of discretion in certain circumstances not to write a report: see Hernandez v Canada, 2005 FC 429, [2005] FCJ No 533.  It is presumably in recognition of that discretion that a practice has arisen for the Officer to invite submissions from the person affected to make the case not to refer the matter to the Delegate.  Indeed, the CBSA utilizes a standard form request inviting the person to address several factors including age, length of Canadian residency, location of family support and responsibilities, conditions in the home country, degree of establishment, criminal history, history of non-compliance and current attitude (see CTR in IMM-2023-18 at p 432).  This approach is consistent with the duty of procedural fairness recognized in some decisions of this Court requiring the Officer to invite submissions from the interested party.
