Clearly the opinions under review are not decisions in the usual sense because, beyond the bare referral for further consideration before the ID, no determinative findings of fact or law are made.  Such an opinion is no more than an evidence-based belief that the circumstances, as presented, are sufficient to warrant a more formal inquiry and a decision.  An opinion in this context bears some resemblance to the formation of a prima facie belief of the sort described in Kindler v MacDonald, [1987] 3 FC 34 (FCA) at para 9, [1987] FCJ No 507, where a referral decision was said not to require even a paper hearing.  Contrary to the Applicants’ submissions the formation and expression of an opinion under s 44 is not equivalent to a misrepresentation finding made in connection with an attempt to acquire status under the IRPA.  Status is neither gained nor lost by the referral process described in ss 44(1) or ss 44(2).
