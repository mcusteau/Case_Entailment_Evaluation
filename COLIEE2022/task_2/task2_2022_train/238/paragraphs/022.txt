After reviewing the evidence of both parties and in particular the affidavits of Pierre Sadik, Jean Reavley and Raymond Baraya, I am convinced that the evidence now establishes that there is an overlap in the markets for the products of both parties. Since both parties' trademarks are clearly applied to wares in the office equipment sector, it can be said that the parties' wares belong to the "same general class" of "office equipment". Although the Registrar did not have access to all of the evidence before this court, he did conclude that the potential overlap in the trades of the parties contributed to his finding of a likelihood of confusion between the parties' trademarks. A review of the evidence before this court precludes me from reversing this finding.
