In support of his assertion that products of the kind sold by the respondent would not likely be sold through the same channels of trade as those sold by the appellant, counsel for the appellant relied on the survey evidence contained in the affidavit of Jean Reavley. However, this evidence pointed to two companies which did, in fact, distribute both computers and photocopiers. I was further convinced that the parties do, in fact, appeal to common customers and distribute their wares through common channels of trade when I reviewed the advertisements contained in the affidavit of Raymond Baraya. Clearly, both parties appeal to customers who fall within a common class of purchasers, that is, purchasers of office equipment. Such a conclusion again supports a likelihood of confusion in the circumstances of this case.
