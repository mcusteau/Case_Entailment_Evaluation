Before examining these factors, I must point out that, in cases such as these, the onus on the appellant is two-fold. Firstly, the appellant must establish that the hearing officer erred in his appreciation of the facts or in his interpretation of the law. It is well established that such a decision carries considerable weight and is not to be lightly set aside (

, [1969] S.C.R. 192, at p. 199;

Cartier Men's Shops Ltd. v. Cartier Inc.
(1981), 58 C.P.R.(2d) 68, at p. 70 (F.C.T.D.)). Secondly, there remains the continuing onus on the appellant to establish its right to registration. Therefore, the appellant must show that confusion between its trademark and the respondent's registered trademark is unlikely (
