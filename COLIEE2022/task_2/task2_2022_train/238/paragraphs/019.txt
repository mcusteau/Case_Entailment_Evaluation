It is important to notice that evidence of "actual confusion" would favour the respondent in this case. To require that the respondent supply such evidence would involve a reversal of the onus in matters relating to confusion between trademarks. As I pointed out above, the continuing onus of establishing a right to registration must be borne by the appellant. As a result, it is the
