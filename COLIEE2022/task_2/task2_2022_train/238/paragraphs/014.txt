[14]
Given the approach taken by counsel for the appellant, the court will consider only those arguments raised by the appellant at the hearing and put aside the arguments set out in the notice of appeal which were not argued. For instance, in its notice of appeal, the appellant raised an argument regarding the Registrar's assessment of the "material time" for considering the circumstances of a case. The point was not raised before this court. Since such a determination is purely academic and has no bearing on the outcome of this case, it is not worthy of further discussion.
