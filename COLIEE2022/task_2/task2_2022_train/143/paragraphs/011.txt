  I have also reviewed the evidence submitted by the Applicant to the Officer. Most of the statements and letters are offered in support of the Applicantâ€™s good character, which is not in dispute. The evidence does identify that she wishes to pursue her studies in Canada, that she has a close relationship to her family in Canada, that she is employed and hard-working and that she contributes to the household expenses and rent with her sister. She has also demonstrated that she is a respected member of her Church community. However, none of the evidence submitted by the Applicant to the Officer allows me to find here that it was unreasonable for the Officer to conclude that the Applicant did not meet the threshold necessary for her to be exempted from the general requirements of IRPA that she make her application for permanent residence from outside Canada. On the evidence, it was reasonably open to the Officer to conclude that the Applicant had not demonstrated the necessary degree of financial or emotional support between the Applicant and her family members and that she would not suffer significant prejudice if required to leave Canada to make her application.
