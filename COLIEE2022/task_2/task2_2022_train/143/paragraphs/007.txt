  In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193, the Supreme Court held that the standard of review applicable to decisions rendered pursuant to subsection 25(1) of IRPA is reasonableness simpliciter. The weight to be attached or assigned to particular factors or indicators of attachment is discretionary. On a standard of reasonableness, a reviewing court must examine the evidence to determine whether any reasons support the impugned decision. Therefore, it is not our role to re-examine the weight given to the different H&C factors by the Immigration Officer. This Court cannot set a decision aside even if it would have weighed the factors differently and arrived at a different conclusion (Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 4 F.C. 358, 2002 FCA 125 at paras. 9-12; Singh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 718 at para. 7; Saliaj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2004), 39 Imm. L.R. (3d) 249, 2004 FC 499 at paras. 6 and 7). Applying this standard to the impugned decision, I have come to the conclusion that the present application cannot succeed.
