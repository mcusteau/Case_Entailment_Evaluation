  The Respondent submits that the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness and that it is not the role of the Court to re-examine the weight given to the various factors considered by the Officer when deciding whether or not to grant the H&C application. The Respondent argues that the decision is reasonable. Indeed, the Officer’s reasons clearly demonstrate she turned her mind to all of the relevant factors and carefully considered them before ultimately concluding that the Applicant had not satisfied the onus of demonstrating sufficient H&C grounds. Furthermore, the Court has held that the H&C process is designed to provide relief from “unusual, undeserved, or disproportionate hardship” if one had to leave Canada to apply for permanent residence. Leaving behind a job, a family, and a home does not necessarily rise to this standard. Finally, the Respondent notes with respect to the Applicant’s argument that the Officer erred in relying on the lack of risk facing the Applicant upon return to St. Vincent that the Officer never suggested a risk was required, but merely referenced the fact that this consideration did not arise in this instance.
