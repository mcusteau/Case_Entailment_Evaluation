  In the case at bar, the Applicant is essentially asking the Court to attribute more weight to her relationship with her family in Canada than the Officer did. The reasons clearly demonstrate that in rendering the decision, the Officer reviewed the totality of the evidence and assessed all relevant factors relating to the Applicantâ€™s relationship to her family and other factors regarding her establishment in Canada. The Officer explicitly addressed the relationship and degree of support, both emotional and financial, between the Applicant and her family. As mentioned above, the Officer also factored in the fact that the Applicant has family members in St. Vincent. In reaching the decision, the Officer simply was not convinced by the evidence provided by the Applicant that the prejudice associated to making her application from outside of Canada met the requisite standard of hardship.
