  I will start by stating that an applicant bears the onus of establishing that he or she has met the standard required to succeed in an H&C application (Owusu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] 3 F.C. 172, 2003 FCT 94 at para. 11). A successful H&C application usually requires an applicant to demonstrate that an “unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship” would arise should he or she be required to apply for permanent resident status from outside Canada. See in this regard Section 6.5 of the Inland Processing Manual, Chapter IP-5, “Immigrant Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian or Compassionate Grounds” published by Citizenship and Immigration Canada. Accordingly, the test is not, as stated by counsel for the Applicant, whether there are factors that may raise in a reasonable person the “desire to relieve the misfortunes of another.” Garceau, above, is not a decision that helps the Applicant as it relates to a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division rendered in the context of an appeal pursuant to subsection 77(3) of the Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985 c.I-2, now repealed. According to that provision, an appeal lies from a failed sponsorship application by the sponsor on the ground that there exist compassionate or humanitarian considerations warranting the granting of special relief. Furthermore, the test of “unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship” has been affirmed and applied consistently by this Court, the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada.
