A review of Mr. Qalawi's PIF, the narrative portion of which is quite brief, discloses that he did mention that after the couple's relationship became known, his father tried to appease Faten's family, offering to have Mr. Qalawi return to Jordan, and marry Faten, and that such a resolution was ultimately agreed to. While Mr. Qalawi undoubtedly provided greater detail regarding the negotiations in his oral testimony, I am not persuaded that there was a material omission from his PIF of the sort identified by the Board.
