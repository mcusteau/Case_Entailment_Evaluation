The Board also did not accept that Faten's brothers and cousin would threaten to kill Mr. Qalawi, given that an agreement had allegedly been entered into between the families for Faten to marry him. Here again, there was documentary evidence before the Board of several cases where honour killings were carried out after pledges were signed by male family members promising not to harm errant individuals. In my view, this evidence should have been addressed by the Board, given that it runs contrary to the Board's conclusion.
