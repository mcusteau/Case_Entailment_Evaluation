In any event, given my determination that the Board's finding with regard to the first inconsistency is unreasonable, and considering the Board's statement that it was the cumulative effect of the two contradictions that rendered the Applicant's story not credible, it is not possible to ascertain what effect the erroneous finding would have had on the Board's analysis and on its ultimate credibility finding. I therefore find that the Board's credibility finding was made in error and is reviewable.
