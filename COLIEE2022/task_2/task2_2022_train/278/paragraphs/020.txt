The appellant's main argument is that the isolated sale of four cartons of cigarettes to one tobacco outlet in Regina does not establish use of the trademark in association with the wares in the normal course of trade. The appellant relies heavily on Plough (Canada) Ltd. v. Aerosol Fillers Inc., supra, and Sim & McBurney v. Majdell Manufacturing Company Limited (F.C. T.D.; unreported; September 23, 1986) in support of this contention. [Now reported 7 F.T.R. 54].
