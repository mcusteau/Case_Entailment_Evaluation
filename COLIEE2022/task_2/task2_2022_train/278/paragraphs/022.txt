Counsel for the appellant contends that the Sim & McBurney case, is clear authority for the proposition that evidence of use in the normal course of trade must contain information as to the volume and type of sales and the numbers and location of purchasers. In that case, the registrant in response to a s. 44 notice submitted the affidavit of its vice-president evidencing three sales of its clothing wares, but leaving much to be desired in the way of detailed particulars. The affidavit nowhere attested to the fact that these sales were made "in the normal course of trade". Mr. Justice Strayer pointed out that while the presence of such a statement would not be sufficient of itself to establish the normal course of trade it would have represented the beginning of compliance with the requirements of s. 44. He considered that the serious problem in Sim & McBurney was the insufficiency of the affidavit in failing to describe the precise nature of the trade carried on by the registrant, thereby precluding the court from drawing any inference that the sales were made in the normal course of trade. It was in this context that he made the statement regarding the deficiency of information as to volume of sales and numbers and location of purchasers. The learned judge went on to order the expungement of the registration on the ground that the lack of further affidavit evidence clearly enabled him to draw the inference that use had not been shown as required by s. 44 of the Act.
