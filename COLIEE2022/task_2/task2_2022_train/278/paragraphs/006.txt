The second Bouchard affidavit deposed in paragraphs 3 and 4 thereof as follows:
"3. THAT it has been drawn to my attention that there is an error in paragraph 9 of my aforesaid affidavit. In particular, the invoice that is marked Exhibit 'B' to my aforesaid affidavit relates to a transaction whereby CAMBRIDGE cigarettes were delivered to the Smoke Shoppe, rather than to Hudsons Bay Wholesale. The CAMBRIDGE cigarettes referred to in Exhibit 'B' were delivered to the Smoke Shoppe on June 20, 1980, by a sales representative of Imperial Tobacco Limited. Thereafter, as shown by Exhibit 'C' to my aforesaid affidavit, Hudsons Bay Wholesale invoiced the Smoke Shoppe for the said CAMBRIDGE cigarettes on July 8, 1980.
"4. THAT in the usual course of Imperial Tobacco Limited's business and trade, it has a number of sales representatives who visit retail outlets with a view to ensuring that the said outlets have an adequate supply of Imperial Tobacco Limited's products. In the event that a retail outlet is found to be in short supply of any particular product, the sales representative will frequently arrange for a delivery of that product on the basis that Imperial Tobacco Limited will thereafter bill its wholesaler, who will in turn bill the retailer in respect of that delivery. The invoices that are marked Exhibits 'B' and 'C' to my aforesaid affidavit are typical of such transaction."
