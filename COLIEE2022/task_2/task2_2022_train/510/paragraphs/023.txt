The defendant, in its motion, sets out that the particulars are necessary for pleading. Particulars before a defence and for the purpose of pleading are not as broad as those furnished for the purposes of trial. A request for particulars is not a fishing expedition. The test is whether a defendant has enough information to be able to understand the plaintiffs' position and to prepare a responsive defence:
"A defendant should not be allowed to use a request for particulars as a means to pry into the brief of his opponent with a view to finding out about the scope of the evidence that might be produced against him at trial, nor should he be allowed to use such a request as a means to go on a sort of fishing expedition in order to discover some grounds of defence still unknown to him. At that early stage, a defendant is entitled to be furnished all particulars which will enable him to better understand the position of the plaintiff, see the basis of the case made against him and appreciate the facts on which it is founded so that he may reply intelligently to the statement of claim and state properly the grounds of defence on which he himself relies, but he is not entitled to go any further and require more than that.
