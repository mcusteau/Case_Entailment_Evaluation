In the context of the plaintiffs relying on provisions of the
Trade-marks Act
, "including" various enumerated sections of the
Act
, one should look at the statement of claim as a whole. The sections of the
Trade-marks Act
available to the plaintiffs to use are limited, by the facts set out in the statement of claim, to those sections of the
Act
specifically set out in paragraph 23 of the statement of claim and to any necessarily incidental provisions, for example those dealing with definition or interpretation.
