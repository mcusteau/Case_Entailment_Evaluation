In
Sittampalam v. Canada (Solicitor General)
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 872; 143 A.C.W.S.(3d) 332; 2005 FC 1352, Justice Eleanor Dawson summarized the principles laid down by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Thanabalasingham
as follows:
"[19] ...
First
, a detention review is not, strictly speaking, a de novo hearing. The record before the Board continues to be built at each hearing and the Board is expected to take into consideration the reasons for previous detention orders.
Second
, the Board must decide afresh at each hearing whether continued detention is warranted.
Third
, where a member chooses to depart from prior decisions of the Board, clear and compelling reasons for doing so must be set out.
Fourth
, the onus is always on the Minister to demonstrate that there are reasons which warrant detention or continued detention. However,
once the Minister has made out a prima facie case for continued detention, the individual must provide some evidence or risk his or her continued detention
