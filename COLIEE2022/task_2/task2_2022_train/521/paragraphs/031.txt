[31]
As an independent tribunal that controls its own procedure, the Immigration Division can always issue a summons to ensure that a witness comes to a hearing to be examined. In exercising this discretion, the Immigration Division must consider any relevant factors. Rule 33(2) of the
Immigration Division Rules
, SOR/2002-229, states the following:
"33(2) In deciding whether to issue a summons, the Division must consider any relevant factors, including
(a) the necessity of the testimony to a full and proper hearing; and
(b) the ability of the person to give that testimony."
