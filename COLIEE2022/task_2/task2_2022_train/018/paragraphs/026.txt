  We do not know, of course, how Dr. Pilowsky would define the precise location of the site of the applicant's traumatizing stressor. Nonetheless, in light of the psychological evidence before it, the Refugee Division erred in finding that it would not be unduly harsh for the applicant to relocate in Mexico outside Mexico City. The fact that the Refugee Division found that, in other respects, it would not be unreasonable to expect the applicant to return - such as the employment prospects of the applicant and his wife - does not mitigate the effect that Dr. Pilowsky predicts a return to Mexico is likely to have on his psychological condition. Indeed, some of those symptoms, such as depression, nightmares and a feeling of detachment, are likely make it much more difficult for him to undertake the search for new and different employment with the necessary energy and motivation.
