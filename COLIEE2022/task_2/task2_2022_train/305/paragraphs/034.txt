By comparison, a person who has not received refugee protection and who is named in a security certificate is only entitled to a modified pre-removal risk assessment. That assessment cannot consider the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution on Convention grounds, and cannot result in the conferral of refugee protection. The result of the favourable decision is a stay of removal which provides protection similar to that enjoyed by a person with refugee protection.
