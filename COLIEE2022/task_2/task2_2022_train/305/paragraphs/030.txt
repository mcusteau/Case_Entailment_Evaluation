In my view, the answer to this submission is found in the wording of section 160(1) of the
Regulations
which indicates that the provisions are "for the purposes of subsection 112(1) of the Act" and that "a person may apply for protection after they are given notification to that effect". It is common ground that notification was not provided to Mr. Harkat. In my view that was appropriate, given that the regulatory provisions exist for the purposes of section 112(1) of the
Act
and section 112(1) does not, as I found above, authorize an application for protection being brought by a person who, having been found to be a refugee, is already a protected person.
