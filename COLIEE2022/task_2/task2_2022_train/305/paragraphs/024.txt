Section 112(1) of the
Act
specifies who may apply for protection and receive a pre-removal risk assessment. Specifically excluded are persons "referred to in section 115(1)". Section 115(1) refers to a "protected person" or "a person who is recognized as a Convention refugee by another country to which the person may be returned" (the latter provision is not relevant to this case). Section 95(2) provides that a "protected person" is "a person on whom refugee protection is conferred under subsection (1)".
