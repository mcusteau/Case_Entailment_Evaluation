It is true that if after the completion of the certificate proceedings the Minister exercises his or her discretion to refoule a protected person, that decision may only be reviewed by the Court if leave is granted by the Court. However, the threshold at law for the granting of leave is low, an applicant need only establish a fairly arguable case. See:
Bains v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1990), 109 N.R. 239 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 1. This does not create an absurd result, and it is offset, at least in part, by the fact that if leave is given a right of appeal exists from the resulting decision where a question is certified by the Court. By comparison, the decision of the designated judge with respect to the reasonableness of the certificate and the lawfulness of the pre-removal risk assessment is not in any event appealable.
