A further distinction exists where the applicant for a pre-removal risk assessment is described in a security certificate. That distinction, found in section 114(1)(b) of the
Act
, is that a positive determination will not have the effect of conferring refugee protection. Rather, the effect of a positive decision in this case is to stay the removal order with respect to a country or place in respect of which the applicant was determined to be in need of protection. Such a stay of removal may, pursuant to section 114(2) of the
Act
, be cancelled by the Minister if circumstances surrounding the stay have changed.
