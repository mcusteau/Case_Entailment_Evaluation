On Mr. Harkat's behalf it is argued that this interpretation leads to the following absurd results:
(i) someone who has not been determined to be a Convention refugee does get a pre-removal risk assessment, prior to the section 80 determination of a certificate, and judicial review of the decision rendered with respect to the application for protection, without leave, pursuant to section 79(2) of the
Act
; however
(ii) someone who has been determined to be a Convention refugee, must wait and then get a risk assessment, "if at all", after the determination of the certificate, for which leave would be required to judicially review the decision. This is described by Mr. Harkat's counsel as "an absurd and nonsensical result incongruous with the clear intent of protection against torture and the clear scheme of the
Act
".
