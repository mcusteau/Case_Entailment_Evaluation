Nothing in the interpretation which I give to section 112(1) is, in my view, inconsistent with the objects of the
Act
, or the
Charter
, or international human rights instruments. Rather, such interpretation reflects that, in the words of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Chieu
, supra, at section 59, "the
Act
treats citizens differently from permanent residents, who in turn are treated differently from Convention refugees, who are treated differently from individuals holding visas and from illegal residents. It is an important aspect of the statutory scheme that these different categories of individuals are treated differently, with appropriate adjustments to the varying rights and context of the individuals in these groups". While those words were written with respect to the former
Immigration Act
, I consider them to be equally apposite to the current
Act
.
