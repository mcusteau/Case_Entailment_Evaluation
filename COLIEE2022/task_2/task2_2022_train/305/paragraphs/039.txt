Mr. Harkat argues that this interpretation contradicts the object of the
Act
to streamline proceedings, in that the
Act
intends to collapse into the inquiry as to the reasonableness of the certificate all issues of removal. I again, respectfully, disagree. First, to so collapse the proceeding would, for the reasons set out above, arguably diminish the protection already afforded to someone such as Mr. Harkat who now enjoys protection as a Convention refugee. Second, the interpretation urged by Mr. Harkat would result in the suspension of this proceeding, followed by the decision with respect to a pre-removal risk assessment, and then the conclusion of the certificate proceedings. At the end of that Mr. Harkat would still, in my view, have the right he now enjoys not to be refouled without a further decision by the Minister, which decision would be judicially reviewable with leave of the Court. The
Act
as I interpret it provides for only one decision as to whether Mr. Harkat may be removed. This interpretation provides for a more streamlined proceeding.
