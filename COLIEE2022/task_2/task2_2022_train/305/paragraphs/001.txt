Dawson, J.
: Mr. Harkat has moved for an order pursuant to section 79 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 ("
Act
") suspending this proceeding in order to permit him to make, and the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration ("Minister") to decide, an application for protection. What fundamentally is put in issue in this motion is the timing of the Minister's decision as to whether Mr. Harkat may be removed from Canada if, in this proceeding, he is found to be inadmissible to Canada. This issue, in turn, depends upon ascertaining Parliament's intention as expressed in the
Act
.
