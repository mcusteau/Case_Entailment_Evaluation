  The Applicants have proposed four questions for certification. Upon careful consideration, I am of the view that none of these questions are necessary to the disposition of this judicial review application. Moreover, they do not constitute serious questions of general importance, and some of them have already been answered by the Court of Appeal in Legault v. Canada (M.C.I.), 2002 FCA 125.
