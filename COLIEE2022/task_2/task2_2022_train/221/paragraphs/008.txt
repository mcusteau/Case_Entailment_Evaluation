 [8] 
  In December 2003, the Applicants submitted a Humanitarian and Compassionate (H & C) Application. Further submissions were requested and received from the Applicants in July 2004, which mentioned the two youngest children. Additional submissions were also received in May 2005, and were considered in the decision. The Applicants alleged essentially the same risks as presented on the RPD and PRRA applications, hardship for the family because of economic, education and criminal conditions in Argentina, and possible separation of the family if removed to the United States. This application was denied on July 20, 2005. The Applicants applied for leave and judicial review of that decision before this Court on August 3, 2005.
