  Despite the Applicants' arguments to the contrary, and in light of the fact that they neither sought nor obtained judicial review of the PRRA decision, it was legally valid and it was not unreasonable for the Officer to consider it. If the Applicants had a problem with the documentary evidence considered by the PRRA Officer, they should have raised it in the context of an application for leave and judicial review of the PRRA decision. The present application is not the proper forum to seek review of the manner in which evidence was considered by the PRRA Officer.
