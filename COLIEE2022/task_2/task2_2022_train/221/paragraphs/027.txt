  The Applicants argued that the Officer's consideration of the best interest of the children was perverse, capricious and without any basis. While they recognized that the Officer was not bound to explicitly address every piece of documentary evidence submitted to her, they nevertheless contended that she erred in failing to address documentary evidence that directly contradicted her conclusions. They relied for that proposition on the decision of this Court in Cepeda-Guiterrez v. Canada(M.C.I.), [1998] F.C.J. No. 1425, where Justice Evans wrote at para. 17: "...the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact 'without regard to the evidence'". The Applicants gave the example of excerpts of a U.S. Department of State Report on Human Rights Practices in Argentina, which was cited by the Officer as a factor weighing negatively on the H & C application. They submitted that she failed to consider other reports that detailed evidence of high dropout rates and child labour in Argentina.
