  Having carefully read the Immigration Officer's reasons, I am of the view that she was alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the Applicants' children, as required by the Supreme Court of Canada in Baker v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 74. She considered the children's young ages, socialization of the family, that they primarily spoke Spanish and had not started school in Canada, and the opportunities and challenges faced by the children and the family if returned to Argentina, as well as the general country conditions and the requirements for undue hardship not anticipated by the legislation. She considered the allegations of risk and the family's history, and found that the hardships faced by the family fell within the normal range of hardship faced by any family being deported, and were not undue. This finding, and the explanations on which it is based, do not strike me as being unreasonable.
