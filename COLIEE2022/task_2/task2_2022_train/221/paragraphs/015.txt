  I agree with the Respondent that the Officer doesn't have to be an expert in the law, as long as she applies the relevant principles. The Officer's reasons show that she clearly considered the best interests of the children according to the requirements of Canadian law, and as interesting as it may be, the Australian decision was of little legal value in the determination of the Applicants' application. As discussed below, the Officer assessed the evidence presented by the Applicants fairly and with a view to all the circumstances of the case, and she did not fetter her discretion in declining to address the Australian decision.
