Second, to the extent that Mr. Johnson argues that the officer was under an obligation to advise him not of the fact of the convictions but rather of the officer's concerns as to his inadmissibility, Mr. Justice MacKay, in
Parmar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1997), 139 F.T.R. 203 (T.D.), wrote at paragraph 36 of his reasons that "there is no requirement for notice of an officer's concerns where these arise directly from the Act and Regulations that the officer is bound to follow in his or her assessment of the applicant." This principle has been applied in a number of decisions of this Court, including the recent decision of
Ayyalasomayajula v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2007] F.C.J. No. 320, and the cases cited therein. In the present case, the officer's concerns arose directly from the Act and Regulations.
