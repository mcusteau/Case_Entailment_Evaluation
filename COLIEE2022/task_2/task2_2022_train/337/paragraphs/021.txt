As for the obligation to consider the existence of the pending appeal, in
Kalicharan v. Canada (Minister of Manpower and Immigration)
, [1976] 2 F.C. 123 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Mahoney considered the situation where a deportation order had issued as a result of a conviction under the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-34. On the appeal of the sentence imposed in respect of that conviction, a conditional discharge was substituted for the original sentence. At paragraph 3 of his reasons, Mr. Justice Mahoney wrote:
[...] Whatever the practical considerations that ought to have prevailed, the
Special Inquiry Officer was under no legal obligation to await the result of the appeal before issuing the deportation order. A person convicted at trial is a convicted person notwithstanding that he may have an unexhausted right to appeal that would render him otherwise
. The applicant was, on February 5, 1976, a person described in subparagraph 18(1)(e)(ii) and, thus, subject to deportation. [footnote omitted and emphasis added]
