 [20] 
  Counsel for the defendants levelled a number of criticisms of the plaintiff's conduct in this trial: 
 
 
 
 (1) for the new trial, the plaintiff chose not to rely on the original expert reports prepared for in the first trial but rather produced new expert reports including six rebuttal reports; 
 
 
 
 (2) the plaintiff's experts put forth theories which unnecessarily complicated the case; 
 
 
 
 (3) the plaintiff's experts contradicted themselves on several points including on the principal question whether The Federal Danube was at anchor when the collision occurred; 
 
 
 
 (4) the plaintiff should have realized it had no case.
