  In  
 Apotex Inc. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd. 
 , supra, Justice Wetston refused to fix costs as a percentage of the plaintiff's solicitor-client costs. In that case, the increase sought was only in respect of counsel fees whereas in the case before me the increase sought is across the board for all items. Justice Wetston was of the view granting costs at two-thirds of solicitor-client costs would be an unwarranted extension of solicitor-client costs, albeit to a lesser degree in quantitative terms. I adopt Justice Wetston's reasoning to refuse the plaintiff's request for a lump sum award of $150,000 which is approximately double a taxed bill of costs based on the maximum level under Column V of Tariff B.
