  On January 31, 2001, I dismissed with costs the plaintiff's action against the defendants. In that action, the plaintiff sought damages against the defendants on account of a collision on December 11, 1984, between two large ocean-going bulk carriers -- The M/V. Federal Danube and the M/V Beograd in Lac St-Louis, located in the St-Lawrence River, west of Montreal, near the Beauharnois Locks.
