  Nonetheless, although I doubt whether I would have reached the same conclusion as the Refugee Division on this issue, on the basis of the evidence as a whole I am not persuaded by the applicant that the Board clearly erred when it found that on the balance of probabilities the applicant faced no serious possibility of persecution outside Mexico City and, perhaps, other cities, like Toluca, within the surrounding state of Mexico. It is therefore unnecessary for me to consider whether the Board's finding was "without regard to the evidence".
