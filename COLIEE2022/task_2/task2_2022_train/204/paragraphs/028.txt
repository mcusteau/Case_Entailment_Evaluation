  I am supported in this conclusion by the decision of Richard, J. (as he then was), in  
 Singh (Gurmeet) and Narang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1995), 97 F.T.R. 139; 30 Imm. L.R.(2d) 226 (T.D.), where the failure of the Refugee Division to mention a relevant and credible psychological report respecting the reasonableness of requiring a refugee claimant to return to his country of origin was held to be an error of law. There are other cases where the omission of any discussion of similar reports has been found not to vitiate the decision:  
 Jhutty v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1996] F.C.J. No. 763 (T.D.);  
 Canizalez et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1997] F.C.J. No. 1492; F.T.R. Uned. 663 (T.D.);  
 Randhawa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1998] F.C.J. No. 749; F.T.R. Uned. 064 (T.D.). However, in these cases, unlike the case at bar, the Board did at least specifically mention or acknowledge the report, so as to justify an inference that the Board had had regard to it.
