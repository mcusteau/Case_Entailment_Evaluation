Correctional Service Canada (the Service) did not dispute the fact that the applicant needs a personal computer on account of his vision problems and that the same handicap requires special accessories for his computer in order to accommodate his disability. However, the right or privilege of an inmate to have a personal computer equipped with certain peripheral equipment in his cell is not absolute. Since 1997, it has been regulated by Directive 090 of the Commissioner of Penitentiaries (the Commissioner), titled "Personal Property of Inmates" (Directive 090). This was amended in June 2003 to limit purchasing new computers and updating computers acquired by inmates prior to October 2002. Further, Directive 090 henceforth prohibited the possession of certain peripheral equipment, including TV tuner cards and storage units, features which had previously been authorized. These new restrictions or prohibitions were apparently related to growing security concerns on the part of the Service related to the development of computer technology.
