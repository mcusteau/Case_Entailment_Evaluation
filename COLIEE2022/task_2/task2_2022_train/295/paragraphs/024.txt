The validity of the aforementioned administrative actions and of Directive 090 were defended by counsel for the respondents. As mentioned earlier, the applicant obtained leave from the Court to file these proceedings, which were filed and served in September 2004 after the 30-day deadline specified in subsection 18.1(2) of the
Federal Courts
Act
, supra. First, the respondents maintained that sections 3, 4 and 76 of the
Act
did not prevent the Commissioner from prohibiting TV tuner cards and storage units. Second, the respondents also argued that Directive 090 does not as such infringe subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
. In their submission, the applicant did not discharge the burden of showing the Court that the purpose or effect of the provision was to impose different treatment between persons or classes of persons on account of a personal characteristic, namely visual disability. The respondents maintained that the directive in question prohibited all affected persons, namely inmates in federal penitentiaries, from using TV tuner cards. According to the respondents, no distinction was apparent simply from reading the directive. Further, the respondents noted that the prohibition did not create an indirect distinction between certain groups of inmates. In fact, they maintained that inmates suffering from visual handicaps were not placed at any greater disadvantage by the prohibition than other inmates. In any event, the respondents considered that the applicant did not need the TV tuner card to use his computer. They noted that the applicant used the said card only for watching television. In their submission, the applicant could always obtain a large-screen TV in order to watch television.
