Soon afterwards, around July 2003, the Head of the Mission Institution issued a news release indicating that inmates having computers with video/TV cards should take steps to remove them from the computers, and that only those who already had computers before October 2002 would be authorized to keep them in accordance with all the applicable policies and requirements. That said, on July 28, 2003, Irving Kulik, Assistant Deputy Commissioner, Correctional Operations and Programs, indicated in a letter to the applicant that (Translation) "Any updating of your computer on account of your vision problems will be regarded as an exception to the decision of the managing committee, which does not authorize the updating of inmates' computers". At the same time, the author of the letter also indicated that all video/TV cards installed in computers owned by inmates should be removed, which presents a problem here as the applicant's acquired rights were clearly maintained by Appendix A of Directive 090 (under the heading "Exceptions").
