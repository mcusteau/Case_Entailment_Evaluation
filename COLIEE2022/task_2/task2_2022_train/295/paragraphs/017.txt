In due course, on September 30, 1998, again by an amendment to Directive 090, the Commissioner altered his policy on computers to also authorize the use of certain peripheral equipment which might include a video card for television or computer signals (technical standards relating to Directive 090 Inmate-Owned Computers). At that time, the applicant had among his authorized personal property computer equipment that included a personal computer equipped with a video card (TV), an LS120 storage unit and a CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. However, on September 10, 1999, by an amendment to the technical standards relating to the Directive 090, the Commissioner decided inter alia that inmates could no longer obtain computers equipped with a TV tuner card. Nevertheless, inmates already authorized to have such a card could keep it. That is the applicant's situation.
