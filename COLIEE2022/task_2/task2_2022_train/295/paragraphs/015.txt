First, the respondents admitted that under subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
the applicant is entitled to the same protection and benefit of the law, without discrimination, and in particular discrimination based on physical disability. In the same way, regardless of the fact that the applicant is suffering from a visual disability, the respondents did not dispute that under sections 3 and 76 of the
Act
the applicant, as an offender, has the right to receive a range of appropriate programs designed to meet his needs (and if possible contribute to his social reintegration as a law-abiding citizen). Of course, it is also admitted that in carrying out its general mandate the Service is guided by the various principles mentioned in section 4 of the
Act
, including the one that offenders retain the rights and privileges of all members of society, except those rights and privileges that are necessarily removed or restricted as a consequence of the sentence.
