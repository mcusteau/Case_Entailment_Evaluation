We now come to the particular circumstances and specific administrative actions taken in the winter and spring of 2004, which led the applicant to subsequently apply to the Court in September 2004. To begin with, on February 6, 2004, the head guard, Don Havelin (CCO), told the Mission Institution inmates' committee that inmates having TV tuner cards should take the necessary steps to remove those TV tuner cards from their computers. On February 9, 2004, the applicant sought a new extension of time. The applicant indicated that he could not remove his TV tuner card since he needed it to prepare legal documents. On March 4, 2004 the Head of the Mission Institution informed the applicant she was allowing him until April 29, 2004 to have his TV tuner card removed, so he could complete his legal documents. In the meantime, on March 10, 2004, the applicant received a communication from counsel for the respondents about an order for an interlocutory injunction sought by the applicant in
Pierre-Paul Poulin v. A.G. (Canada)
, T-2006-02. In the latter case, the applicant wished to prevent the seizure of his computer by the Service. The communication in question indicated that the applicant's computer would be seized on April 29, 2004 on account of his refusal to comply with the order by the competent authorities of the Service. In any case, on April 13, 2004 the applicant asked the acting Head of the penitentiary whether he could retain his computer until July 15, 2004. On May 6, 2004 the Institutional Head refused to allow the applicant to retain his computer until July 15, 2004. He insisted on the applicant immediately taking the necessary action to remove his TV tuner card and LS120 storage unit from his computer.
