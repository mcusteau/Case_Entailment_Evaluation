Martineau, J.
[Translation]: The applicant Pierre-Paul Poulin is currently an inmate at the Mission Institution in British Columbia. Although he is not blind, he has a serious visual handicap. In fact, the applicant is a client of the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB). In short, his visual condition, which is gradually deteriorating, means that he needs specialized equipment and accessories and, in particular, has difficulty watching television on his 14-inch monitor. For this reason, the applicant prefers to watch television on his 22-inch computer monitor using a TV tuner card. This method of operation allows him to read the subtitles and any other text on the screen.
