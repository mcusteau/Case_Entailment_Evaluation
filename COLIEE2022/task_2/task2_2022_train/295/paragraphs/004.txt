In fact, since 1997, the applicant has had a personal computer equipped with a TV tuner card, an LS120 storage unit and CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. However, in May 2004, the prison authorities confiscated the applicant's computer so as to remove the TV tuner card and LS120 unit, at the applicant's expense. First, the applicant submitted that these administrative actions affected acquired rights which were protected by Directive 090 in the case of inmates who had been authorized prior to October 2002 to have a non-compliant computer or peripheral equipment. Second, the applicant submitted that these actions (and even Directive 090 itself) were otherwise contrary to the equality right of all individuals guaranteed by subsection 15(1) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part I of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, being Schedule B of the
Canada Act, 1982
(U.K.), 1982, c. 11 (the
Charter
), and also recognized by paragraph 4(e) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, S.C. 1992, c. 20 (the
Act
). The respondents, on the contrary, argued that these actions were expressly authorized by Directive 090 and that the restrictions imposed on the applicant were not contrary to the
Charter
or the
Act
.
