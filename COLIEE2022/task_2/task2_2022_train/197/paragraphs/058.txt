  Turning now to section 6(5)(a), there is no new evidence with respect to the inherent distinctiveness of the trade-marks. As to the extent they have become known, based on the totality of the evidence, I can only conclude that Mövenpick's "Marché" has become known to a certain extent. I am of the view, however, that "Marché Express" is much better known. There have only been a handful of "Marché" restaurants in operation sporadically. There are far more "Marché Express" stores, the sales therein are far greater and they have been heavily advertised. One need only mention the "Marché Express" signage on the hockey boards at the Bell Centre in Montreal, from where Montreal Canadiens hockey games are telecast. Again, I do not think the new evidence would have affected the Registrar's decision, in that circumstance, or with respect to the length of time the trade-marks have been in use. While Mr. Hamid may well have provided better evidence as to the length of time the "Marché" trade-mark has been in use in Canada, I find the evidence insufficient.
