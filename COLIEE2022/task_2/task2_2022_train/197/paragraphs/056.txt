  As mentioned earlier, Esso also provided new evidence by Robert Klein, a market researcher, in the form of a survey of over 2,000 consumers in Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal. The results indicate that there is no likelihood of confusion between Esso's "Marché Express" and Mövenpick's "Marché". Mövenpick has not moved to have the affidavit struck because it relies upon it to support its "clearly descriptive of the services" submissions, but criticizes the methodology when it comes to its value to the Court in determining the likelihood of confusion. I will discuss Mr. Klein's evidence later on.
