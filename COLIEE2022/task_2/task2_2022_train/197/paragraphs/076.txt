  Mövenpick argues that the Murphy and Levins affidavits are in violation of Rule 81 of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
 , and cannot be acted upon by this Court since it is unclear which facts are based on personal knowledge and which ones are gathered from business records. Esso, on the other hand, submits that its evidence is entirely consistent with its claim that "Marché Express" has been used in Canada since 19 July 2001, and its corporate records constitute unchallenged business record evidence, admissible under s. 30 of the  
 Canada Evidence Act 
 .
