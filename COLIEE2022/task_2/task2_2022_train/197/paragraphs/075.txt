  I am once more of the view that the new evidence on this point merely shores up what was before the Registrar when she made her reasonable decision. If there is any doubt, however, Mr. Levins produced a milestone report showing that the store in St-Hubert had opened 18 July 2001, sales records and Esso's annual report for 2001, which specifically refers to the opening of "Marché Express" and "On the Run" company-owned stores. Mövenpick has not succeeded in raising doubt about the veracity of Esso's claimed date of first use.
