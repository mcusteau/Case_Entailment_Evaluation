  Mövenpick's position is that "Marché Express" is descriptive of the service Esso offers, i.e. "convenience stores" and so cannot be registered under the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 . It is also confusing with its own well-known "Marché" trade-mark used in association with the operation of restaurants. Finally the evidence offered by Esso as to the date the trade-mark was first used is unsatisfactory.
