  Canadian courts have held that administrative tribunals are not restricted by the rules of evidence applicable to court proceedings. As explained by Mr. Justice Sopinka in  
 Prassad v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration) 
 , [1989] 1 SCR 560, at paragraph 46: "As a general rule, these tribunals are considered to be masters in their own house. In the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, they control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice."
