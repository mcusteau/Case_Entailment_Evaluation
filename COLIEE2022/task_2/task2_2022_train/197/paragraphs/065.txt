  In my opinion, the Klein survey, whether or not the methodology used was reasonable, would not have affected the Registrar's decision. It showed insignificant confusion which, if relevant, could only be used to bolster the Registrar's opinion. What it shows, together with evidence filed by Esso before the Registrar, and the evidence filed on behalf of Mövenpick, is that it is difficult, if not impossible, for a consumer to see "Marché Express" signage without at the same time seeing an Esso sign, and for a patron at a Mövenpick restaurant to see "Marché" without at the same time seeing "Mövenpick".
