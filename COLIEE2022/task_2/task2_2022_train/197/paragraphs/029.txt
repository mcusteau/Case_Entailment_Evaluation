  The word "clearly" has been held to mean "easy to understand, self-evident or plain" and specifically preserves the registrability of suggestive trade-marks. The Act only prohibits the registration of marks that are  
 clearly 
  descriptive. Courts have consistently recognized that a trade-mark is registrable even though it is suggestive or even descriptive. Courts also permit the skilful allusion to a characteristic of the associated wares or services (Kelly Gill & R. Scott Jolliffe,
