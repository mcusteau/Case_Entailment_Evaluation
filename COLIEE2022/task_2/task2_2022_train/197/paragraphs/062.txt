  There is a registered trade-mark which could be invoked to support the proposition that the fast-food services offered at the "Marché Express" stores fall within the rubric of convenience stores, so that the reference to such services in the application is mere surplusage. The registration for "Marché Mainway & Design", owned by Irving Oil Marketing G.P., describes the services on offer as including gas bar, carwash, petroleum products, "retail convenience store services" and "retail convenience store services, namely, fast-food services and take-out food services." In its submissions before the Registrar, Mövenpick said that the nature of the services offered by the parties overlap "to the extent that [Esso] has not excluded "restaurant services" from its statement of services ..." It suggested before me that the potential confusion could be avoided by striking "and fast-food" from the description of services offered.
