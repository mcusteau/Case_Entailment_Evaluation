  Some caution must be exercised in drawing upon  
 Veuve Clicquot 
 ,  
 Mattel 
  and  
 Masterpiece 
 . The first two dealt with what can only be called famous trade-marks. Neither Esso nor Mövenpick suggests that "Marché Express" and "Marché" are as famous as Veuve Clicquot champagne or Barbie Dolls. In  
 Masterpiece 
 , an expungement action, the confusion was between an unregistered trade-mark which had been in use and a mark subsequently registered on the basis of proposed use. In other words, the analysis was under section 16 of the Act, not section 12.
