She found that Mövenpick's mark possessed some measure of inherent distinctiveness when used in association with "operation of restaurant". She was of the view that "Marché Express" possessed less inherent distinctiveness as "Marché" was highly suggestive of the services. She went on, however, to say that the extent to which the marks have become known may increase their distinctiveness. Based on Esso's evidence, including sales and advertising figures, she was satisfied that "Marché Express" had become known to a certain extent.
