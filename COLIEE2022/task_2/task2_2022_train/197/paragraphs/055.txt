  Esso provided evidence from Ryan Levins, convenience retailing manager of Imperial Oil, a licensee of Exxon Mobil. Although the thrust was to shore up earlier evidence that the marks had been used at Esso gasoline stations since 19 July 2001, he also provided facts and figures as to the extent to which "March√© Express" had become known, primarily in the Quebec market. Mr. Hamid's evidence cannot be considered without also taking into account Mr. Levins'.
