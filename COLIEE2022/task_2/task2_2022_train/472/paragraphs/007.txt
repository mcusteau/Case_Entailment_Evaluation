After this, the Board reviews the claim based on her religious conversion and finds that the claimant's actions in Canada in this regard are "implausible and inconsistent with the action of a person who has a well-founded fear of persecution". To justify this conclusion, the Board simply states that it cannot accept the applicant's assertion that she was "unaware of the consequences of her conversion when she came to Canada". For the Board, the draconian measures adopted by the Iranian clergy, in condemning any form of religious expression other than their vision of Islam are well-known around the world and it is inconceivable that the claimant would not be aware of such restrictions, especially given her own testimony that she had Christian friends at high school who left the country due to fear of persecution. It found questionable that she would take the risk of a public baptismal ceremony. The Board concludes that it is not satisfied that the motive of the conversion was "purely religious". It was one more attempt to streamline her status in Canada.
