The respondent made reference to the following passage:
"RPO: Okay, thank you. And I'd like to refer you also to the same page, question - of the Personal Information Form, question 25. No. 20. Just a second, I guess it's an error, 20. Question 20. 'Are you or were you wanted by the police or military or any other authorities in any country?' You stated 'No.'
CLAIMANT: That's right.
RPO: Now, as a convert would you be wanted by the police if you went to your country?
CLAIMANT: Yes, it's illegal in Iran (inaudible) Islamic law (inaudible).
RPO: Okay.
CLAIMANT: And if you convert (totally inaudible).
RPO: So you would say that it's a yes instead of a no, that you're wanted by the police or would you leave it as a no?
CLAIMANT: I don't know what to say.
PRESIDING MEMBER: Let that go."
