Although I am in general agreement with the comments made by Rothstein, J., his requirement that "some form of application" is required where an applicant wishes a visa officer to exercise his or her discretion under s. 11(3) must be read in the context of the facts before him, in which the applicant had no experience whatever in his intended occupation. In particular, there was nothing on the face of the application to suggest that there were "some good reasons why a units of assessment determination would not reflect the chances of successful establishment in Canada by the applicant". The facts considered by Rothstein, J., in
Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, supra, are therefore distinguishable from those in the present case, in which the applicant was not only qualified in his intended occupation as an electronic equipment repairer, but he also had a bona fide job offer in his field with a Canadian company.
