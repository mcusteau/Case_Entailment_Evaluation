The applicant submits that, while the applicant's PIF narrative may be imprecise and misleading on the point, he first went to see a lawyer about his options some 8 or 9 months after arriving in Canada (as opposed to "a few months" indicated in his PIF) and as such, this aspect of the delay was much shorter than the Board indicated. Furthermore, the applicant agues that the Board totally ignored his explanation as to why he did nothing after consulting the first lawyer; his excuse was that he had no money to finance a refugee claim and was put off by the lawyer that he first met.
