The Applicant raises three issues in this application for judicial review. First, he argues that the Board erred in law and misapplied paragraph 58(1)(b) of the
Act
by discounting the factors set out in subsections 245(f) and (g) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (the "
Regulations
"). The Applicant argues that the Board made its decision on the basis of the Member's personal belief and speculation and in the absence of countervailing evidence.
