The Respondent fled Sri Lanka on November 25, 2009, by flying to Thailand. On May 1, 2010, he boarded the M.V. "Sun Sea". He was one of 492 persons smuggled to Canada on board that ship. The M.V. "Sun Sea" arrived in Canada on August 13, 2010. The cost of his passage was $8,000 and the Respondent owes an additional $5,000 that remains unpaid. The Respondent has a brother in France who was able to help pay his initial debt. During interviews with the CBSA, and in submissions before the Board through his Counsel, the Respondent stated that his brother could pay the $5,000 he owes, but as of the date of the detention review hearing, he had been unable to contact that brother since arriving in Canada. The Respondent has no family or friends in Canada.
