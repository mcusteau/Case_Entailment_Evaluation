The issue of whether the Board erred by failing to apply the factors set out in subsections 245(f) and (g) is a question of law and reviewable on the standard of correctness. The alleged failure of the Board to consider whether the Respondent will appear for a removal order is an issue of mixed law and fact; see
Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. X
. The Board's choice of release conditions is a matter of mixed fact and law, reviewable on the standard of reasonableness. The manner in which the Board weighs the evidence before it, in reaching its conclusions, is also reviewable on the standard of reasonableness.
