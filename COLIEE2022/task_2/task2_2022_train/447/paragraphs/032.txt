A recent decision of this Court favours the statutory interpretation urged by the Respondent. In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. B157
(2010), 379 F.T.R. 251; 2010 FC 1314, Justice de Montigny held at para. 45, in very similar circumstances, that:
"[45] There were good reasons for the Member to focus on the next immigration proceeding rather than the removal. An officer may always, with or without a warrant, re-arrest the Respondent if he has reasonable grounds to believe he is inadmissible (an easily-met condition if the Respondent were found inadmissible by the Immigration Division) and is unlikely to appear for his removal: s. 54 of
IRPA
.
. . . . .
"[47] In light of these further proceedings that are set to occur before removal and of the possibility of re-arresting the Respondent, the Member's failure to conduct a premature analysis of the likelihood to appear for removal, as compared to the probability of appearing for the inadmissibility hearing, does not represent a fatal flaw in his decision."
