Having considered the materials filed and the submissions of the parties, I am satisfied that the Board's decision with respect to subsections 245(f) and (g) of the
Regulations
is reasonable. The Board's finding that the amount owed by the Respondent to the smugglers is not so great as to give rise to undue influence of the smugglers over the Respondent, is justifiable and defensible. The evidence on the Record is that the Respondent's brother may be able to pay the $5,000. The Board took this evidence into account.
