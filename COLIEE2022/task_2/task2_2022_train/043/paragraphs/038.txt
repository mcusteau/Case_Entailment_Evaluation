 [38] 
  As there was clearly an error of law made by the previous tribunal in regard to the definition of "disability", the VRAB had the statutory mandate under section 111 of the  
 Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act 
  to determine whether or not it should reconsider the earlier decision. The VRAB committed a reviewable error by ignoring this error of law in determining whether or not to reconsider the earlier decision. The VRAB did not dispute that the applicant did suffer some hearing loss during his military service which was at least partially caused by noise exposure within that military service. There is no question that the Minister can establish and use a table to assess the extent of a disability, but to determine whether or not there is a disability, section 3 of the  
 Pension Act 
  applies.
