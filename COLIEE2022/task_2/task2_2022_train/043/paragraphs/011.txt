  In particular, the VRAB found that the evidence did not address the relevant issue in this case, namely, that the applicant did not have the disability level hearing loss at the time of his discharge from the armed forces. The VRAB stated: 
 
 
 
 "While the Board recognizes that some decibel losses were recorded within the Appellant's military service, and while it recognizes that excessive noise exposure within that service was at least a partial cause of those decibel losses and, therefore, of the Appellant's present-day hearing loss disability, it is bound by the legislative authority of the hearing loss policy [Chapter 9 of the Table of Disabilities] which states, in part: 
 
 
 
 'If the audiogram on release from service does not meet the requirements for hearing loss disability, any hearing loss demonstrated on subsequent audiograms is not considered due to service-related noise exposure and therefore, pension entitlement is not normally awarded.' 
 
 
 
 "Given that situation, the information you offer as new evidence could not,  
 when taken with other evidence adduced earlier, be expected to affect the result.
