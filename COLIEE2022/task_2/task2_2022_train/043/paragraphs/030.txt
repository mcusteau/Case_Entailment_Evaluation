  At the hearing, it became clear that the major question to be determined was how it was to be determined whether a person had a disability. Was it pursuant to the definition of disability contained in section 3 of the  
 Pension Act 
 , or by using the Veterans Affairs Table of Disabilities, Chapter 9, Ears and Hearing? This table was made by the Minister pursuant to subsection 35(2) of the  
 Pension Act 
 .
