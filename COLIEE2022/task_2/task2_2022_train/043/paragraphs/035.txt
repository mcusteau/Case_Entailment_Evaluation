 [35] 
  As noted earlier, when there is a conflict between a statutory provision (section 3 of the  
 Pension Act 
 ) and a provision of subordinate legislation or policy, the  
 Act 
  prevails. In the present case, the Minister established the Veterans Affairs Table of Disabilities, Ears and Hearing, pursuant to section 35 of the  
 Pension Act 
 . Accordingly, the definition of "disability" contained in section 3 of the  
 Pension Act 
  is the prevailing definition.
