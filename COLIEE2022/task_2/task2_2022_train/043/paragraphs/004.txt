  Prior to joining the armed forces, the applicant was medically examined and it was found that he did not have any hearing problems. However, an undated audiogram, taken at about the time of his discharge, indicated that the applicant had some high frequency hearing loss in his left ear. The applicant believes that the hearing loss was due to excessive noise exposure during the course of his military service, from performing tasks such as firing small arms and missiles, driving personnel carriers, and working on aircraft.
