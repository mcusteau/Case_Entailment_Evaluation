 [14] 
  The respondent submitted that the issues raised by the applicant are more properly stated in the context of this Court's ability to review the VRAB's decision of November 15, 2004. Pursuant to section 111 of the  
 Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act 
 , S.C. 1995, c. 18 (the  
 Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act 
 ), which is reproduced below, the VRAB has the discretion to reconsider a decision of the VAB if (1) an error was made with respect to any finding of fact or the interpretation of any law in the decision, or (2) new evidence is presented by the applicant. Accordingly, the respondent restated the issues as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the VRAB err in failing to reconsider the VAB decision of April 20, 1995 for errors of law or errors of fact? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the VRAB err in refusing to admit the new evidence submitted by the applicant for reconsideration?
