 [23] 
  The respondent submitted that the conclusions drawn by the VAB on April 20, 1995, and the VRAB on November 15, 2004, were clearly supported by the evidence before it and the applicant's evidence was incapable of rebutting the evidence of the prior hearing test and establishing a link between the applicant's service and his hearing loss. On this basis, the respondent submitted that the VRAB was entitled to reject the applicant's evidence, and the decision to do so cannot be said to be patently unreasonable.
