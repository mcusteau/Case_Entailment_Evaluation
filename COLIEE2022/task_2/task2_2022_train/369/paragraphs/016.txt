As each case turns on its own merits, I find that no precedent will help me decide whether a denial of justice occurred in the present case. The question to be answered is whether the Applicant, both for himself and the members of his family, had a reasonable opportunity during the interview to persuade the Citizenship Judge that the complex and extensive evidence before him warranted a positive citizenship decision. I have no hesitation in saying that the Applicant was not provided with this opportunity.
