It is very clear from the decision rendered, that the written material did not impress the Citizenship Judge sufficiently to give a positive determination. In such circumstances, it was critically important for the Citizenship Judge to give the Applicant a solid chance to use his powers of persuasion to change his mind. I agree with Counsel for the Applicant that the Citizenship Judge closed the door to this opportunity. Therefore, on the facts of the present case, I find that the failure to accord this meaningful opportunity to be heard is a denial of natural justice.
