[15]
I agree with Counsel for the Applicant that, while an applicant for citizenship does not have a right to an interview with a citizenship judge, if it is granted, it must be conducted fairly. The Applicant's evidence of what occurred in the present case on this issue is uncontradicted:
"... I had expected this interview would allow my family and I an opportunity to fully explain our life spent in Canada over 22 years. However, the Citizenship Judge spent approximately only 10 minutes speaking to me and only briefly spoke to my other family members - my wife, Petra and my two sons, Mark-Oliver and Benjamin. He did not discuss or review with me or my family any of the material we had submitted in support of our citizenship applications. He indicated before even starting [the] interview that he had already decided that he could not grant us citizenship. I felt shocked because I wondered why we had been convoked for an interview if he was going to make the decision before even hearing from us. He did not give me any chance to explain anything because he made it clear that he had already made up his mind."
