  Considerable deference is given to the decision of a visa officer assessing an application in the Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) Class. As stated in  
 Akbar v Canada 
 , 2008 FC 1362 at paras 11-12: 
 
 
 
 The particular expertise of visa officers dictates a deferential approach when reviewing their decision. The assessment of an applicant for permanent residence under the FSWC is an exercise of discretion that should be given a high degree of deference. To the extent that this assessment has been done in good faith, in accordance with the principles of natural justice applicable, and without relying on irrelevant or extraneous considerations, the decision of the visa officer should be reviewed on the standard of unreasonableness ( 
 Kniazeva v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 268 (CanLII), 2006 FC 268 at para. 15;  
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9 (CanLII), 2008 SCC 9). 
 
 
 
 The DIO is authorized to make decisions relative to the issuance of visas. He has greater expertise in this regard than the Court and that expertise attracts deference ( 
 Singh Tiwana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 100 (CanLII), 2008 FC 100).
