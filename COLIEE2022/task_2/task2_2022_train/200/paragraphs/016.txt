  There are two issues embedded in the assessment of a FSW application: the substantive training or education and the certification. Proof of the former without the later, as in this case, does not meet the legislated requirements. Proof of attendance or graduation does not address or respond to the regulatory requirement of accreditation. The  
 Regulations 
  are directed to accreditation or regulation, a matter which is unaddressed by a graduation certificate. The graduation certificate, or diploma, or degree is some evidence that the individual has obtained training or education, but it is not evidence in respect of the accreditation of the school that granted the degree. The documents do not link the education certificate received to any institution "... recognized by the authorities responsible for registering, accrediting, supervising and regulating such institutions in the country of issue." as required by the  
 Regulations 
 .
