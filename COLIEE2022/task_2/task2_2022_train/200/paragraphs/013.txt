  The July 19, 2010 letter indicates that the applicant knew that his spouse's education credential from the Correspondence Institute of Party School of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China was not approved by Cadgedc and that CIC ordinarily relies on Cadgedc to demonstrate that an education credential is recognized by China. The onus was on him to provide satisfactory evidence of accreditation in respect of his spouse's education. The Officer's exercise of discretion was, in light of the evidence before him, reasonable.
