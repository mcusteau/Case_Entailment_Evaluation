  In  
 Jiang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 1145, an applicant for permanent residence from China relied on two post-secondary diplomas, but without a Cadgedc certificate. Like the applicant here, the applicant in that case provided certificates from the schools and an explanation as to why Cadgedc did not certify her credentials. This Court found that reliance on CADGEDC certification was simply a matter of weight and was not an improper fettering of discretion. Justice James W. O'Reilly wrote at paragraph 7: 
 
 
 
 Ms. Jiang asks the Court to find that the officer erred when she concluded that her evidence of accreditation was insufficient and that her explanation for not being able to obtain accreditation from the CADGEDC was inadequate. In my view, the officer was entitled to give the evidence provided by Ms. Jiang whatever weight she felt it deserved. I cannot find her conclusion - that the certificate supplied by Ms. Jiang was insufficient - was unreasonable. There was no evidence that the Shanghai Panel Telecommunications Group was a proper accrediting authority; nor was there evidence that the Shanghai Technician School was an accredited institution.
