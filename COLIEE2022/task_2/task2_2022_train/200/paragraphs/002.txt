  This application for judicial review is limited to a review of the Officer's failure to award points for the applicant's spouse in the Adaptability category - this is the only ground that the applicant has advanced. Mr. Chen does not take issue with the other points allocated to him, but argues that he should have been awarded four (4) points in the Adaptability category, as opposed to the zero (0) he received, based on his wife's educational credentials.
