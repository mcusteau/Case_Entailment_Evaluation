I do not conclude that this withdrawal had any legal effect on the applicant's application. That application was processed and the reason given for denying that application did not relate to that withdrawal. The letter of December 19, 1991, denying the application reads as follows:
"Dear Mr. Rosa:
"This refers to your application for permanent residence in Canada.
"I have now completed the assessment of your application and I regret to inform you that your application has been refused as you are a member of the inadmissible class of persons described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the
Immigration Act
in that you are not eligible for sponsorship pursuant to subs. 4(3) of the
Immigration Regulations
because, in my opinion, you entered into marriage with Leah Blanche Rosa (nee: Davis) primarily for the purpose of gaining permanent residence in Canada as a member of the family class and not with the intention of residing permanently with your spouse.
"My reasons for forming this opinion are that you have never had the intention of residing permanently with Mrs. Rosa and in fact solicited her to marry you so that she may submit a family class sponsorship for you and that once this was submitted you no longer maintained a normal husband-wife relationship. I have evidence that indicates you admitted to people that you did not love your wife and that you married her solely for gaining residency in Canada. You stated to numerous persons that as soon as you were granted residency you planned to leave Mrs. Rosa and take her daughter with you. Furthermore, I have evidence indicating that you threatened individuals that may have wished to step forward and shed any light on the nongenuineness of your application in the hope that our office would not realize that your intentions were insincere and would in fact continue with your application.
"For your information, I have attached the relevant passages of the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
which concern your inadmissibility."
