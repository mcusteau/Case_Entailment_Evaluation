The
Sivacilar
decision (
Sivacilar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1984), 57 N.R. (F.C.A.)) is based on the fact that the application for landing had been determined. It had been dealt with before the exempting order-in-council issued. Mr. Justice Hugesson makes it abundantly clear that on two occasions in the application, it was stated that, that applicant had met all the requirements of the
Act
:
"The document submitted to the Governor-in-Council requesting special authority contains, as I have indicated, in two separate places a formal assertion, endorsed by a senior immigration officer, that all the requirements of the
Act
have been met. The document is a request for authority to admit the applicant notwithstanding subs. 9(1). Upon the adoption of the order in council P.C. 1983-2469, the applicant became a person with the right to come into or remain in Canada. He had acquired the right to be landed and nothing remained to be done in the granting of landing to him. His wife's subsequent purported withdrawal of the sponsorship was accordingly without effect."
