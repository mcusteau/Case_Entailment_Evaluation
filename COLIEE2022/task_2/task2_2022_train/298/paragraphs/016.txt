I have read the decision in the
Dawson
case carefully (
Dawson v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1988), 21 F.T.R. 212; 6 Imm. L.R.(2d) 37 (F.C.T.D.)). I do not interpret it as counsel for the applicant suggests it should be interpreted. The applicant's application for landing in that case was decided by the Immigration Officer on the ground that the wife's withdrawal of the support for the application was determinative of the issue.
