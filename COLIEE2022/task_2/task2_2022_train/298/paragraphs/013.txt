It is clear, in my view, that an order-in-council exempting an individual from the visa requirements of subs. 9(1) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, does not confer a right to permanent residence on the applicant. The exemption's effect is to allow the making of an application for landing despite the fact that the applicant is already within Canada. [s. 9(1) stated:] "Except in such cases as are prescribed, every immigrant and visitor shall make an application for and obtain a visa before that person appears at a port of entry".
