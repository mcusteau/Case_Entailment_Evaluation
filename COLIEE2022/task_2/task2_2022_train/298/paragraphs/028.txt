In that regard, any subsequent evidence concerning the relationship of the parties, the reunification of the applicant and his wife is not something that I am entitled to take into account. I would be making an error of law if I did so. I must ask myself if I could say, that sitting in the place of the Immigration Officer when his decision was made, there was insufficient evidence to support his conclusion. I cannot so conclude. I therefore must dismiss this application.
Application dismissed.
