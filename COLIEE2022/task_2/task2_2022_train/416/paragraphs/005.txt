At the outset of the trial I raised as a preliminary procedural matter the question of representation of the plaintiff who initiated the action on her own behalf without representation by a solicitor. At trial her husband, who is not a solicitor, sought to represent her. I did so in light of court rule 300(1) which provides:
"An individual may act in person or be represented by a solicitor in any proceeding in the court."
The plaintiff's husband, who is fluent in English, indicated that his wife is not at all fluent in English, either in speaking or in understanding, and that he had carried the process up to trial on her behalf. Counsel for the defendant agreed that the husband had represented the plaintiff on two previous occasions before the court, dealing with defendant's motions that the Statement of Claim be struck out as revealing no cause of action which was dismissed, and that the trial be adjourned from the original date set in May. On those occasions the issue of representation of the plaintiff by her husband had not been questioned and counsel for the defendant had no objections to this representation for the plaintiff at trial.
