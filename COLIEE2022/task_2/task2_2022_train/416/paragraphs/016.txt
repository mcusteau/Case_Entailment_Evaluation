The plaintiff was then directed to a secondary inspection, this time carried out by customs officer Steven Eastman, serving at the time as secondary inspector. With the declaration cards she presented, now as coded by officer West, he asked what was included in the goods declared as having been acquired. Included were items of clothing, shoes, household goods and the pair of earrings given to her daughter but no other jewelry. He says that he examined the baggage which appeared to contain items consistent with the values declared. He noticed that the plaintiff was wearing gold bangle bracelets and he asked about those and any other jewelry. Thereupon the plaintiff showed him photographs of jewelry and the appraisal form completed by the Vancouver jeweller before she had left Canada. Upon his request, the plaintiff then produced the other jewelry items in issue here. Officer Eastman took the photographs, the appraisal form and the jewelry into another room where he noted the following:
(1) the total weight of the items of jewelry produced by the plaintiff differed from the total for similar items listed on the appraisal form;
(2) the plaintiff had four bangle bracelets with her on her return to Canada, though the appraisal and the photographs only included two, a difference the plaintiff subsequently explained by saying she had only two of her four bangles with her when they were appraised in Vancouver in November but had decided to take four with her when she went to India;
(3) A necklace depicted in the photograph was a single strand of gold while that produced by the plaintiff on arrival at the airport on February 8 consisted of three strands.
Officer Eastman admitted the photographs of the jewelry presented to him by the plaintiff were not of good quality and that they did not adequately reveal details of the items depicted.
