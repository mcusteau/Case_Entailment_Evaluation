The plaintiff did not report, as she was required to do, that she was importing with her on arrival in Canada, the items of jewelry redesigned in India. When asked by the primary inspection officer, Mrs. West, in both Punjabi and in English, whether she had purchased, acquired or received any jewelry while out of the country, she answered "no" except with reference to a pair of gold earrings received by her daughter. Only after the secondary inspector, Eastman, spoke to her about bangle bracelets she wore but had not declared, and when, after she produced the photographs and Vancouver appraisal, he asked to see other jewelry did she produce the other items. Only after all the items had been examined by Eastman, who noted apparent differences from the items described in the Vancouver appraisal, and after she had been asked specifically whether she had jewelry redesigned in India did she admit that was the case. It was urged for the plaintiff that her lack of facility in English had led to misunderstandings on her part, but in view of the evidence of customs officer West, who had asked in Punjabi about jewelry, and had been told by the plaintiff that she would prefer to speak in English, I am satisfied that whatever the plaintiff's understandings of her responsibilities to report to customs officers were, they did not arise from any language disability that she herself was prepared to acknowledge at the time. It must have been evident to her that she was free, and indeed was encouraged, to speak in her native Punjabi had she desired to do so.
