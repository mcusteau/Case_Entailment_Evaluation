It was further urged, as noted earlier, that only two of four bangle bracelets had been redesigned and that the changing of a long single strand gold chain to a shorter three strand chain was not redesigning of the jewelry. Yet these claims were not substantiated by testimony of the plaintiff or by other evidence. The plaintiff's failure to report the jewelry that had been redesigned, it was said, arose from her ignorance that redesigned jewelry was considered for customs purposes as new. Finally it was urged that the plaintiff be entitled to recover her jewelry upon payment of the duty assessable on those items that were redesigned after taking into account the allowable limit of goods to be admitted duty free when brought into the country by a returning resident of Canada.
