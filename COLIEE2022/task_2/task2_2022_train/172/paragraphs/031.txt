  Ms. Pannu argues the officer erred by ignoring a psychologist’s report documenting threats and abuse by her first husband, Mr. Saroya. She also claims the officer did not provide sufficient reasons to explain why she discounted a letter from Ms. Pannu’s father. But having reviewed the reasons of the officer, I am of the view that these claims are ill founded. First of all, the psychologist’s report was simply a recitation of Ms. Pannu’s submission. It could not be considered probative evidence of spousal abuse, as it was essentially hearsay. Therefore, the officer did not have a duty to refer to it explicitly. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Ozdemir v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCA 331, at paragraph 9, “Decision-makers are not bound to explain why they did not accept every item of evidence before them. Much depends on the significance of that evidence when it is considered in light of the other material on which the decision was based.”
