  Subsection 11(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the IRPA) requires foreign nationals to apply for visas before they arrive in Canada. By submitting an H&C application, Ms. Pannu asked for an exemption from subsection 11(1). Under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA, applicants can apply for visas within Canada, provided they can establish sufficient humanitarian and compassionate or public policy grounds to justify using the exemption. It is widely understood that invoking 25(1) is an exceptional measure, and not simply an alternate means of applying for permanent resident status to Canada.
