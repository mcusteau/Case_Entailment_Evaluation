  I do not think that the reference in the last sentence to the risk to life of personal security is proof that the officer applied the wrong test. First of all, the officer could certainly adopt the factual conclusions in her PRRA decision to the analysis she was making in the H&C application (Liyanage v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1045 at paragraph 41). Second, it is clear from a contextual reading of this paragraph that she was coming to the conclusion that the Applicant would not suffer unusual and undeserving, or disproportionate hardship since there was no objective evidence of personal risk. Not only did the officer correctly set out the H&C test at the very beginning of her reasons, but she also concluded her discussion of the Applicant â€™s allegations of risk and hardship in the following way: 
 
 
 
 With the evidence before me, I find that the applicant has not provided sufficient persuasive evidence to establish that she faces a personalized risk to her life or a risk to the security of the person from her ex-husband if returned to India. Similarly, I find that the applicant has not provided sufficient probative evidence to establish the hardships associated with returning to India amounts to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
