  As for the letter from Ms. Pannuâ€™s father, the officer did refer to it but found that it was self-serving. The officer found the letter was inconsistent with the fact that Mr. Saroya had made no attempts in the last 15 years to contact Ms. Pannu directly, and that there is no indication the relationship included any history of domestic violence. This conclusion does not strike me as being unreasonable.
