  There is no disagreement between the parties that the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness, pursuant to Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817. Accordingly, this Court will not interfere with the H&C decision unless it discloses no line of analysis which could reasonably lead the officer from the evidence to the conclusion she reached (Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan, 2003 SCC 20, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247 at paragraphs 48-49; Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc., [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748 at paragraph 56).
