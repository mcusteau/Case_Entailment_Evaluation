In
Gao v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 61 F.T.R. 65; 18 Imm. L.R.(2d) 306 (T.D.), at page 318 [Imm. L.R.], Mr. Justice Dub√© summarized the jurisprudence concerning judicial review of a decision of an immigration officer based on medical grounds, as follows (footnotes are here omitted):
"The governing principle arising from this body of jurisprudence is that
reviewing or appellate courts
are not competent to make findings of fact relating to the medical diagnosis, but
are competent to review the evidence to determine whether the medical officers' opinion is reasonable in the circumstances of the case
. The reasonableness of a medical opinion is to be assessed not only as of the time it was given, but also as of the time it was relied upon by the Immigration Officer, since it is that decision which is being reviewed or appealed. The grounds of unreasonableness include incoherence or inconsistency, absence of supporting evidence,
failure to consider cogent evidence
, or failure to consider the factors stipulated in s. 22 of the
Regulations
." (my emphasis)
