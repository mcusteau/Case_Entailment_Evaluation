Dr. Betheras, a pediatrician, related Matthew's medical history from birth. Concerning Matthew's present condition, Dr. Betheras indicated that Matthew participates in various sports, is able to travel to school by train by himself, has shown no change in neurological signs over the years, and had little in the way of acute illnesses.
