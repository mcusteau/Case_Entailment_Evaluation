In
Ismaili v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1995), 100 F.T.R. 139; 29 Imm. L.R.(2d) 1, at 16-17 [F.C.] (T.D.) (hereinafter, "
Ismaili
") I stated:
"Although the decision in
Ahir
, supra, refers only to an adjudicator or the Appeal Board, it is only logical that the same power would be extended to a visa officer ...
"The Court of Appeal has clarified this power of inquiry and directed that a visa officer must also decide whether there is a linkage between the evidence of the medical condition and the issue of whether applicant might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services.
. . . . .
"The visa officer - wholly apart from the decision of the medical officers - is obliged to consider whether the applicant's medical condition would place excessive demands on health or social services. The visa officer, without second-guessing the medical, diagnostic opinion, must consider all of the available evidence."
