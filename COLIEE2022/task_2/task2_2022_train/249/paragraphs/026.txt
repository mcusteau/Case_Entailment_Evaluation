More recently, in
Ajanee v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) et al.
(1996), 110 F.T.R. 172; 33 Imm. L.R.(2d) 165 (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay concluded:
"The reasonableness of the opinion of the medical officers may be an issue for the visa officer. Where on the evidence before him or her a question arises whether the opinion is reasonable the visa officer may elect to seek further medical advice. Where no serious question arises on the record before him or her, the visa officer may act on the basis of the opinion as it is presented to him or her."
