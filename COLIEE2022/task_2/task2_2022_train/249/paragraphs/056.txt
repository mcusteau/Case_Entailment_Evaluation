As was held by Mr. Justice McKeown in
Sabater v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 102 F.T.R. 268; 31 Imm. L.R.(2d) 59 (T.D.), at page 64 [Imm. L.R.]:
"This is not to say that a person suffering from mild mental retardation could not be found to cause excessive demands on social services, as there are many factors that must be considered when making such a determination. In my view, however, it would be reasonable for there to be
a higher onus of proof on the medical officer to demonstrate excessive demands in a situation of mild retardation. That is, if it is found that a person suffers from mild mental retardation, it must clearly be set out why they have been found to cause excessive demands on social services
