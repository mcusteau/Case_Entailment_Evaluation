The applicant was requested to provide three expert reports to Immigration regarding Matthew. It seems that a decision was made as to the medical inadmissibility of Matthew on the basis of only one of the reports submitted, which happened to be the least favourable report. There is an indication that Immigration officials may have refused to consider the two other reports requested of the applicant -- which reports were more favourable to Matthew.
