In a diagnosed case of mild mental retardation, the medical officers bear a heavy onus to explain why the dependant child is likely to place
excessive
demands on services. The conclusion that an individual is in the "M7" category of medical inadmissibility -- the highest category of medical inadmissibility -- is a very serious conclusion that requires support in the evidence. At the very least, the contrary evidence should be mentioned by the medical officers before it is discarded.
