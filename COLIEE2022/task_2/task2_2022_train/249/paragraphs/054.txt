Did the medical officers enquire as to what kind of social services would actually be required in Matthew's case, and what costs would be associated with these services? There is no evidence before me that the medical officers made any such enquiries as they would relate
specifically
to Matthew's
circumstances
. I fail to see how the medical officers could come to the conclusion of "excessive demands on social services," given the evidence before them regarding likelihood of recourse to social services, the particular social services likely required should such recourse be necessary, the expense of such services given the off-set from Matthew's Australian disability pension, and the quality of family support available to Matthew. There is an absence of evidence to support the conclusion of excessive demand. There is
no evidence
to show that the medical officers put their minds to the question of excessive demand
as it relates specifically to Matthew
. To the contrary, the evidence seems to show that the medical officers only considered the demands placed on social services by the mentally disabled
in general
.
