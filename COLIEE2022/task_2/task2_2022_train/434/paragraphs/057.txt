[57]
For all of the foregoing reasons, I am therefore of the view that this appeal must be dismissed, with costs. In light of the plaintiff's admission that she did not report the Currency to Canadian Customs officials on August 28, 2005, either when she exported it to the United States or when she imported it back into Canada, there is no doubt that the defendant was correct to decide that subsection 12(1) of the
PCMLTFA
had been contravened in the case at bar.
