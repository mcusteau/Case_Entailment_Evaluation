This is indeed the conclusion reached by my colleagues in the only two cases that have dealt with this issue so far. In
Tourki
v.
Canada
(Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)
, supra, Justice Harrington rejected Mr. Tourki's argument that his lack of awareness of the obligation to declare would warrant overturning the Minister's decision that he had contravened subsection 12(1). Similarly, Justice Kelen recognized the irrelevance of the traveller's subjective intention when failing to report cross-border currency, further to a motion for summary judgment brought by the Minister in respect of a section 30
PCMLTFA
statutory appeal:
Hoang v. Minister of National Revenue et al.
(2006), 287 F.T.R. 103; 2006 FC 182. I strongly agree with their reasoning and conclusion.
