de Montigny, J.
: This proceeding is a statutory appeal by way of action brought by Khetam Thaiher Zeid pursuant to section 30 of the
Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing
Act
, S.C. 2000, c. 17 (
PCMLTFA
) against the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (Minister). Since this is a trial de novo, the task of this Court is not to review the record that was before the Minister when the decision was made, but rather to determine whether the evidence that is before the Court shows that Mrs. Zeid contravened the cross border currency reporting requirement.
