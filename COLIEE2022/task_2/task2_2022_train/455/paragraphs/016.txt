In the affidavits supporting this appeal, the applicantâ€™s husband and daughters speak to the many tragedies experienced by the applicant in her life, to the fact that she has raised twelve children, including six children left behind by her deceased sister, and that she never had the opportunity to attend school in Afghanistan. However, from the tribunal record, it does not appear that such information was before the citizenship judge and therefore it cannot be considered as part of this appeal, which is not an appeal de novo.
