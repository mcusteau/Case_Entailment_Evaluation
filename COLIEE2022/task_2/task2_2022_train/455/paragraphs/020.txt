In Abdule v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1524 (QL), Madam Justice Donna McGillis considered whether a citizenship judge erred in deciding not to recommend an exemption from the knowledge requirement under the Act. In granting the application, Justice McGillis wrote the following at paragraph 18:
Â¶ 18 In outlining her reasons for refusing to make a recommendation for the exercise of discretion, the citizenship judge noted that the applicant had failed to provide "any evidence" to establish, among other things, that she had "a physical disability or disease severe enough to impair the learning process". However, to the contrary, the applicant had adduced two letters from a physician outlining medical reasons concerning her inability to learn. As a result, the statement of the citizenship judge that the applicant had not adduced "any evidence" establishes unequivocally that she either failed to consider relevant evidence or misapprehended the evidence before her. The citizenship judge therefore erred either by failing to consider the medical evidence or by misapprehending it.
