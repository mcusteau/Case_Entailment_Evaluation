In his August 29, 2006 decision, the citizenship judge rejected the applicantâ€™s application for citizenship, on the ground that she did not have an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, as per the requirements of paragraph 5(1)(e) of the Act. The citizenship judge also considered whether to make a recommendation for an exercise of ministerial discretion under subsections 5(3) and 5(4) of the Act, but concluded that there was no evidence presented at the hearing of special circumstances that would justify making such a recommendation.
