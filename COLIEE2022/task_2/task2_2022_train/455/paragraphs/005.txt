The issues for consideration in this citizenship appeal are as follows:
1) Did the citizenship judge commit a reviewable error when he concluded that the applicant did not have an adequate knowledge of Canada and of the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship?
2) Did the citizenship judge commit a reviewable error when he concluded that there were no special circumstances that would justify a recommendation to the Minister that he waive the knowledge requirement or otherwise grant citizenship to the applicant?
