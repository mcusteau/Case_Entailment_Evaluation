  I would rephrase the issues as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. What is the appropriate standard of review? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the visa officer err in finding that the applicant failed to meet the conditions of her previous Temporary Residence Visa? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the visa officer fail to properly assess the applicant's eligibility for the live-in caregiver program?
