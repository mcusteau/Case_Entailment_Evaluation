  The Applicants recognize that a well-founded fear is based on the existence of both a subjective and an objective component. They cite and rely on the Federal Court of Appeal decision in  
 Adjei v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1989] 2 F.C. 680 which held that the objective component of the test is defined in terms of a "reasonable chance" that the persecution would occur if the Applicants were returned. The Court expanded this test in  
 Ponniah v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration) 
 (1991), 13 Imm. L.R. (2d) 241, in finding as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Good grounds" or "reasonable chance"... is less than 50 % chance (i.e. a probability), but more than a minimal or mere possibility. There is no intermediate ground: what falls between the two limits is "good grounds". If the claimant, as the Board said, "...may face slightly more than a mere possibility ..." of persecution, he had crossed the lower limit and had made his case of "good grounds" or a "reasonable chance" for fearing persecution.
