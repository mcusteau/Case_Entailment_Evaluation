  None of the contradictory evidence is addressed in the Decision. Counsel for the Respondent suggests that the reason why the Board failed to refer to this evidence is because the RIR is dated September 2006, so that the Board was entitled to rely upon more recent documentation that refers to improvements in the situation and action by the Albanian Government to deal with blood feuds. However, this completely ignores the advice of the Protection Officer which appears at page 270 of the Certified Tribunal Record and which refers to a May 2008 paper, and makes it very clear that, notwithstanding legislative changes and government initiatives, the Government of Albania "is unable to deal with blood feuds effectively or offer significant protection to citizens. Albanian legislations have acknowledged that in Albania there is an absence of the rule of law." All of this is ignored by the Board. The Officer simply selects incomplete references and evidence to support a finding that the Applicants have not rebutted the presumption of state protection. The Decision is entirely unreasonable for this reason. See
