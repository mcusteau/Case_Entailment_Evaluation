 [9] 
  The Applicants submit the following issues on this application: 
 
 
 
 1) Did the Board err in law in its interpretation and application of the definition of Convention refugee and a person in need of protection as per sections 96 and 97 of the Act? 
 
 
 
 2) Did the Board base its Decision on an erroneous finding of fact or facts that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it? 
 
 
 
 3) Did the Board base its Decision on findings of plausibility based on inferences that were not reasonably open to it? 
 
 4) Did the Board fail to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural fairness or other procedure that it is required by law to observe? 
 
 
 
 However, not all of the formal grounds for review are raised by the Applicants in their submissions. Essentially, the Applicants argue that the Board's findings on state protection are unreasonable.
