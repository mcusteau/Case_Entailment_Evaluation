  Counsel for the Respondent has suggested to the Court that the reason this evidence was disregarded was its source: the Committee for National Reconciliation. The Board is, of course, entitled to prefer some evidence over other. However, where no explanation is provided for the failure to refer to contradictory evidence, then the Court may well conclude that it was simply ignored or was overlooked. See  
 Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , (1998) 157 F.T.R. 35.
