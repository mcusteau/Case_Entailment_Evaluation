  I am of the view that a request for temporary residence is implicit in an application for permanent residence. A new application is not necessary if the applicant is found to be inadmissible for permanent residence. A simple letter is sufficient to trigger the request for temporary residence, based upon the existing application (for permanent residence) if the applicant has been found to be inadmissible for permanent residence.
