  Section 9(1.2) of the  
 Immigration Act 
  [see footnote 6] provides that: 
 
 
 
 "A person who makes an application for a visitor's visa shall satisfy a visa officer that the person is not an immigrant." 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 "La personne qui demande un visa de visiteur doit convaincre l'agent des visas qu'elle n'est pas un immigrant." 
 
 
 
 This provision requires that the visa officer be satisfied that the applicants were genuine students seeking to enter Canada for a temporary purpose. She found otherwise.
