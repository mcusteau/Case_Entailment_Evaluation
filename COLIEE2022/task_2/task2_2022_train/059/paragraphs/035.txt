  In  
 Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342; 92 N.R. 110; 75 Sask.R. 82, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the doctrine of mootness is part of the general policy that a court may decline to deal with a case that raises hypothetical or abstract questions. A case is moot when the decision will not have the effect of resolving a live controversy affecting or potentially affecting the rights of the parties. Such a live controversy must exist, not only when the action or proceeding is commenced, but also when the court is called upon to make its decision.
