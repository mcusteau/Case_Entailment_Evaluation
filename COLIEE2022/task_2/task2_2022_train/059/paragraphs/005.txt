  For the reasons set out below, I am satisfied that the Board did not err in deciding to release Mr. Romans from immigrationdetention. However, in light of the Board's finding that Mr. Romans represented an ongoing danger to the public, the decision not to impose any conditions on his release was patently unreasonable, and cannot stand.
