  The position of the Attorney General of Canada has evolved during the ensuing period. The affiants proffered by the Attorney General were examined by his counsel and the Court in the absence of the applicants and their counsel. Many exhibits were filed by the Court in testing the assertions made on behalf of the Attorney General of Canada. During this process, the Attorney General has, from time to time, authorized further disclosures of some of the information in issue pursuant to section 38.03. Consequently, there now exists a relatively small number of issues to be adjudicated by the Court.
