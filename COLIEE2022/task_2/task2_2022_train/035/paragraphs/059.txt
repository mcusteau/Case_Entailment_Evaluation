  The importance for Canada of respecting the third party rule, described above at paragraph 25, was highlighted in  
 Ruby v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police et al. 
  (2002), 295 N.R. 353; 2002 SCC 75. Writing for the unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, Justice Louise Arbour relied on an extract from one of the affidavits filed in the Federal Court, the court of first instance in  
 Ruby 
 , in describing Canada as a "net importer" of information exchanged among intelligence services (at paragraph 44): 
 
 
 
 "Canada is not a great power. It does not have the information gathering and assessment capabilities of, for instance, the United States, the United Kingdom or France. Canada does not have the same quantity or quality of information to offer in exchange for the information received from the countries which are our most important sources. If the confidence of these partners in our ability to protect information is diminished, the fact that we are a relatively less important source of information increases our vulnerability to having our access to sensitive information cut off."
