 [58] 
  On the basis of the evidence received in private sessions, I am satisfied that the disclosure of the grey-markings in paragraphs 73 and 73.A would tend to identify the anonymous source to the person whose name has been redacted by Justice Dorval. That person might then be able to identify and put in peril the anonymous caller. Also, disclosure might allow the anonymous caller to identify himself or herself. This could raise concerns about preserving the anonymity of this source, who called the National Hotline on a nameless basis. I accept the testimony of the witness for the Attorney General of Canada on this issue. In my view, the harm to national security by putting even an anonymous source in jeopardy outweighs the interest being asserted by the applicants in the context of this file. An order will issue prohibiting the disclosure of the grey-marked information in paragraphs 73 and 73.A.
