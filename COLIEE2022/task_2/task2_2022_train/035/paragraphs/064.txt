 [64] 
  In an ex parte affidavit filed on June 23, 2006, which dealt with several issues, a second officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police purported to characterize the grey-marked words in paragraph 87.B as originating from one or more foreign intelligence services. Previously, no other affidavit evidence had objected to the disclosure of these words on the basis of the third party rule. The Court noted its concern but, under reserve, allowed further questioning of the affiant.
