 [30] 
  On October 23, 2006, the Attorney General of Canada disclosed to the applicants all of paragraph 10.01 at pages 28, 29 and 30 of Appendix D-1, except for eight words. The words which have not been disclosed concern the identity of the originating source of the information and when it was received. Keeping in mind the balancing test required in subsection 38.06(2), I am satisfied that the public interest in non-disclosure prevails on the basis of the third party rule.
