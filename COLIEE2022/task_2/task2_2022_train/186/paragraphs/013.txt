  The Plaintiff's statement of claim instituting the present proceedings was issued by the Court on May 27, 2008. The reason for the delay of 17 months between the defendant's request that the matter be referred to the Court and the commencement of proceedings was said to be that evidence in support of the allegations in the Notices was still being pursued.
