  There is no satisfactory explanation for the delay of three and a half years, from June 2003 to December 2006, to move the revocation process forward. On December 14, 2004, and again on December 22, 2004, the case analyst then working on the file mentioned, in an email message, that no progress had been made on it and that it was necessary to gather more evidence. However, the next day, he drafted a memorandum to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, recommending the revocation of the defendants' citizenship.
