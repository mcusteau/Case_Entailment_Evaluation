  As for a declaration that these proceedings amount to an abuse of process - similar to one which the Supreme Court did in fact grant in  
 Khadr 
  - it would, in my opinion, exceed the Court's jurisdiction under subsection 18(1) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 . In a passage quoted with approval in  
 Tobiass 
 , above, at para. 52, the Federal Court of Appeal said of this Court's decision under subsection 18(1) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
  that "[a]lthough the decision followed a hearing at which much evidence was adduced, it was merely a finding of fact by the court ... The decision did not finally determine any legal rights." ( 
 Canada (Secretary of State) v. Luitjens 
  (1992), 142 N.R. 173; 9 C.R.R.(2d) 149 (F.C.A.), at 152 [C.R.R.].) In other words, the jurisdiction of this Court, in proceedings brought under subsection 18(1) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 , is confined to answering a single factual question: did the defendants obtain, retain, renounce or resume citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances? The declaration sought by the Defendants does not answer that question, and is thus outside the Court's substantive jurisdiction.
