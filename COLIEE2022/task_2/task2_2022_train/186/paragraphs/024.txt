  Generally speaking, a court will find that an attempt to apply or enforce legislation has become an abuse of process when the public interest in the enforcement of legislation is outweighed by the public interest in the fairness of administrative or legal proceedings; see  
 Blencoe v. Human Rights Commission (B.C.) et al. 
 , [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307; 260 N.R. 1; 141 B.C.A.C. 161; 231 W.A.C. 161; 2000 SCC 44, at para. 120, where the test is set out as follows: 
 
 
 
 "In order to find an abuse of process, the court must be satisfied that, 'the damage to the public interest in the fairness of the administrative process should the proceeding go ahead would exceed the harm to the public interest in the enforcement of the legislation if the proceedings were halted' ([Brown, Donald J.M., and John M. Evans.  
 Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada 
 , Toronto: Canvasback, 1998 (loose-leaf)], at p. 9-68). According to L'Heureux-Dubé, J., in [ 
 R. v. Power 
 , [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601], at p. 616, 'abuse of process' has been characterized in the jurisprudence as a process tainted to such a degree that it amounts to one of the clearest of cases. In my opinion, this would apply equally to abuse of process in administrative proceedings. For there to be abuse of process, the proceedings must, in the words of L'Heureux-Dubé, J., be 'unfair to the point that they are contrary to the interests of justice' (p. 616). 'Cases of this nature will be extremely rare' ( 
 Power 
 , supra, at p. 616). In the administrative context, there may be abuse of process where conduct is equally oppressive."
