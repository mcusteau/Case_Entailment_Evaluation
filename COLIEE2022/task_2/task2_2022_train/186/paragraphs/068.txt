 [68] 
  With respect to the proposed order that the Governor in Council "backdate" the revocation of the Defendants' citizenship, I note that the Governor in Council is not a party to these proceedings. I do not see how the Court could order a person or entity to do or not to do anything as a result of proceedings in which he, she or it did not take part. The alternative order suggested by the Defendants, that the Governor in Council find a suitable remedy for the abusive proceedings to which they have been subjected, suffers from the same defect. In addition,  
 Khadr 
  is no authority for the proposition that the Court may make such an order. The Supreme Court's  
 disposition 
  - as opposed to its reasons - consists only of a declaration, and does not include any order to the Prime Minister or anyone else (see  
 Khadr 
 , above, at para. 48).
