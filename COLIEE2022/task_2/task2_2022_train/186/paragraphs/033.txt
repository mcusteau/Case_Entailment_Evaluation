  The case is so simple that no piece of evidence was shown at trial which could explain the delay. While Ms. Demers suggested that background investigations may have been ongoing between the drafting of the first memorandum to the Minister recommending revocation of the Defendants' citizenship in 2004 and the issuance of the statement of claim in 2008, there is no evidence that they were. In fact, Ms. Demers was unable to show any new evidence, with one minor exception, gathered between May 2003 and June 2008. The only developments in this case during that period were the memoranda to the Plaintiff recommending the revocation of the Defendants' citizenship in December 2004 and again in 2006.
