  Thus I cannot accept the Plaintiff's argument that more evidence was needed before a notice of revocation could be issued. It is clear, from the documentary evidence and the testimony given at trial that none was gathered. The memorandum on the basis of which the Plaintiff finally issued the notices of revocation in December 2006 was substantially similar to the one prepared two years earlier, in December 2004. One wonders what additional evidence was needed other than that on the basis of which the RCMP obtained the Defendants' conviction, and indeed that of the conviction itself. If, however further evidence was needed, it was already in CIC's possession, in the shape of the Defendants' daughter's H&C application and the letter sent by Mr. Parekh to CIC.
