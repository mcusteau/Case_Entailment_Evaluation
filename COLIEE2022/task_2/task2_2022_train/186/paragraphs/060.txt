  In  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass et al. 
 , [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391; 218 N.R. 81, the Supreme Court, reversing a stay ordered by the Federal Court, explained, at para. 90, that: 
 
 
 
 "[i]f it appears that the state has conducted a prosecution in a way that renders the proceedings unfair or is otherwise damaging to the integrity of the judicial system, two criteria must be satisfied before a stay will be appropriate. They are that: 
 
 
 
 (1) the prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; and 
 
 
 
 (2) no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that prejudice." 
 
 
 
 (The Supreme Court referred to  
 R. v. O'Connor (H.P.) 
 , [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411; 191 N.R. 1; 68 B.C.A.C. 1; 112 W.A.C. 1, at para. 75.) 
 
 
 
 Furthermore, "in certain cases, where it is unclear whether the abuse is sufficient to warrant a stay, a compelling societal interest in having a full hearing could tip the scales in favour of proceeding" ( 
 Tobiass 
 , above, at para. 92).
