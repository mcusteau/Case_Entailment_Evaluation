 [50] 
  The Federal Court of Appeal held, in  
 Kamel v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2009), 388 N.R. 4; 2009 FCA 21, that a refusal to deliver a passport to a Canadian citizen is an infringement of subsection 6(1) of the  
 Charter 
 . As Justice Robert DÃ©cary, writing for the Court, pointed out at para. 15, "[t]he fact that there is almost nowhere a Canadian citizen can go without a passport and that there is almost nowhere from which he or she can re-enter Canada without a passport are, on their face, restrictions on a Canadian citizen's right to enter or leave Canada, which is, of course, sufficient to engage  
 Charter 
  protection."
