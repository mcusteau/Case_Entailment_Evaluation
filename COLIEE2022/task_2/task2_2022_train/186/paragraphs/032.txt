  However, the present case is not complex. It does not require unraveling mysteries of long-forgotten events on far-away battlefields. The facts here are, on the contrary, clear and simple. The Defendants have, in 2002, pleaded guilty to the charges of making false representations on their citizenship applications.  
 They thus admitted the facts on which these proceedings are based. 
  They have never gone back on that admission. On the contrary, on both the original and the updated H&C applications Mr. Parekh clearly stated that he and his wife had resided in the US for over a year between 1999 and 2000. He repeated this admission in March 2006, in a letter to CIC, referred to at trial as "the confession," outlining his and his wife's residence history. This letter was received by a local office and apparently did not make its way to the officers handling the revocation proceedings against the Defendants, even though the local office had been aware of these proceedings.
