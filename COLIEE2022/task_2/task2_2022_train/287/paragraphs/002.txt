In paragraph 3 of its amended defence, the defendant argued that the plaintiff's trademark was invalid under s. 18(1) of the Trade Marks Act, which reads as follows:
"18(1) The registration of a trademark is invalid if
(a) the trademark was not registrable at the date of registration;
(b) the trademark is not distinctive at the time proceedings bringing the validity of the registration into question are commenced; or
(c) the trademark has been abandoned;
and subject to s. 17, it is invalid if the applicant for registration was not the person entitled to secure the registration."
