I am satisfied that the last two of these requirements are met. The Proposal originated and was communicated to PWC in a reasonable expectation of confidence that it would not be disclosed. That is what the applicant's preamble to each volume of the Proposal clearly indicated, unless the Proposal resulted in a contract, in which event use or disclosure of the information was to be governed by the contract. In addition, the Proposal was submitted in response to a call for proposals in relation to a specified major public work project. The relationship of the applicant and PWC as tenderer and receiver of a project proposal was consistent with the public interest and that relationship in the ordinary course was fostered for public benefit by confidential communication, at least up until the time the contract was awarded, or the project abandoned by PWC. Treating the information as confidential at least to that time serves the public benefit, ensuring competitive bidding in regard to engineering, management, workmanship and pricing proposed for the project. If the Proposal meets those requirements, the Record, which is an evaluation of part of the applicant's alternative proposals, must be accepted as meeting those requirements as well.
