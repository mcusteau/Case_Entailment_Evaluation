[13]
That application was not filed with the court until May 15, 1992, some 24 days after the letter of April 9, sent to the applicant by registered mail, was received by the applicant on April 21, 1992. Section 44(1) of the
Act
provides:
"44(1) Any third party to whom the head of a government institution is required under paragraph 28(1)(b) or s. 29(1) to give a notice of a decision to disclose a record or a part thereof under this Act may, within 20 days after the notice is given, apply to the court for a review of the matter."
In view of the statutory provision the respondent submits that the application under s. 44(1) in relation to the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal was filed out of time, and for this reason the application should be dismissed.
