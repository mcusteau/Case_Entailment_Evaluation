In my opinion, the court ought not to allow the Amended Notice of Motion, filed August 25, 1993, insofar as it relates to the matter of a review of the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal. Not having filed for review within the time prescribed by s. 44(1), that matter is not within the court's jurisdiction by reason of s. 44(1), unless the court grants leave to extend the time for filing, which was not here sought, or allows the application as amended. While it is said that the issue raised by the decision to disclose the Proposal of the applicant arises out of circumstances similar to those leading to the decision to disclose the Record, and that the respondent could not here claim to be surprised that a review was sought of the decision to disclose the Proposal, the record in this case shows that PWC made two separate decisions, each in relation to a specific request for particular information, which requests were different, one about tunnel proposals and the other about bridge proposals, and both PWC and the applicant treated the decisions separately, at least until the applicant's Amended Notice of Motion was filed. There is, moreover, no representation here made about how permitting review of the decision to disclose the Proposal would serve "to ensure the proper working of that Act [i.e., the
Access to Information Act
] and the better attainment of its objects" (The words quoted, except those in square brackets, are from s. 46(2) of the
Federal Court Act
.), particularly in light of its primary object of providing access to information, upon request, aside from exceptional cases. That would seem to me essential if the court is to be persuaded that the case is exceptional and warrants the exercise of discretion to consider the matter even though it is formally raised after the normal time for seeking a review has expired. Only if persuaded that this is the case would the court be warranted in relying on the
Federal Court Act
and the court's
Rules
to treat the case as an exception to the ordinary process set out in the
Access to Information Act
.
