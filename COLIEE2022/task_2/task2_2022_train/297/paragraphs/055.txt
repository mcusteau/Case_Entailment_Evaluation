[55]
The Amended Notice of Motion in Court File T-916-92 is dismissed:
(a) insofar as it incorporates an application to review the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal because the court is not persuaded that any ground is here established to treat the circumstances as an exceptional case warranting exercise of any discretion the court may have to consider the matter when not raised by filing application within the time limited by s. 44(1), and
(b) insofar as it includes review of the Record, the application does not establish that its disclosure would lead to a reasonable expectation of probable harm to the applicant under paragraphs 20(1)(c) and 20(1)(d), and the Record does not contain confidential information within paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
Act
