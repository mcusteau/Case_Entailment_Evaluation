Dawson, J.
: Ms. Marsh is a retired member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Force or RCMP) who submitted a grievance in respect of what she characterizes to be her forced retirement from the Force. Specifically, she says that she was forced into retirement and into taking her retirement relocation move without any consideration being given to allowing her to move and continue as a member of the Force for two years following that move. The Grievance Advisory Board (GAB) established under the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. R-10 (
Act
), considered her grievance and recommended that it be denied. Subsequently, her grievance was denied by both a Level I Adjudicator and a Level II Adjudicator (Adjudicator). This application for judicial review is brought in respect of the decision of the Adjudicator that the grievance be denied on merit.
