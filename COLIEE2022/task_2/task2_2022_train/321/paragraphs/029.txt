It is correct, as Ms. March argues, that at the time of her original grievance she had some knowledge of individuals who she believed had received the benefit of a "pre-retirement move". This was raised in her letter of September 15, 2000 which formed part of the GAB package. There, she noted that in her grievance presentation she had sought information concerning the names and regimental numbers of members who had been allowed to take a retirement move and continue working for two years. She was advised that within "E" Division there were five such members, but their names were protected as private information.
