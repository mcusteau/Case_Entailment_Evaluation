As noted in
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
, Brown & Evans (Looseleaf) (Toronto: Canvasback Publishing 2000), at 9:8100, administrative delay may be invoked as a ground for impugning administrative action. However, delay by itself will rarely constitute a ground of review. Generally, in order to establish that delay rises to the level of a breach of the duty of fairness, an applicant must establish actual prejudice to their ability to provide a full answer or defense. (Brown & Evans at 9:8230).
