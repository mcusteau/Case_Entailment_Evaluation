It is to be remembered that the common remedies for a person aggrieved by any delay in reaching a decision are mandamus or a stay of proceedings (depending upon whether the person is the moving or responding party). I am concerned that Ms. Marsh took no step to expedite or compel the decision at issue, but simply awaited the decision. After learning that the decision was negative, she now argues that the Adjudicator lost jurisdiction by delay.
