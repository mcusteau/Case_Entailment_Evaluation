[30]
In view of the fact that as part of the grievance process Ms. Marsh had sought and obtained some evidence in respect of members who had taken a pre-retirement move, and had placed that information before the GAB, I find her submission that but for the delay she would have been able to adduce further evidence of members who had taken pre-retirement moves to be unsupported by evidence. There is no evidence of what, if any, additional evidence Ms. Marsh could have obtained. In her grievance presentation she had already availed herself of her right, under s. 31(4) of the
Act
, to obtain "access to such written or documentary information under the control of the Force and relevant to the grievance as the member reasonably requires to properly present it".
