[14]
On this application for judicial review, Ms. Marsh raises the following three issues:
1. Did the Adjudicator lose jurisdiction, fail to observe a principle of natural justice, procedural fairness or other procedure that he was required to observe, by virtue an unreasonable delay in dealing with her grievance?
2. Did the Adjudicator err in law by determining that it was Ms. Marsh's responsibility to demonstrate that other members of the RCMP had been given the advantage of a pre-retirement move?
3. Did the Adjudicator base his decision on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without reasonable regard to the material before him?
