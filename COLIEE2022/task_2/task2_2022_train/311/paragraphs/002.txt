The applicant is a 38-years-old female citizen of Korea. She has been in Canada for substantive periods of time between 2000 and the present. It appears that she had made four visits to Canada prior to returning in June 2003. The applicant came to the attention of the immigration authorities on December 14, 2003 following her arrest in a body massage parlour. She had overstayed her visa and it appears that she was working in said massage parlour without a work permit. She made her claim for refugee protection on December 22, 2003 after this arrest. She bases her claim on the assertion that in Korea she had been the victim of gender-related violence at the hands of an acquaintance, Mr. Jung, who stalked her and abducted her. The Board refused the application on credibility grounds.
