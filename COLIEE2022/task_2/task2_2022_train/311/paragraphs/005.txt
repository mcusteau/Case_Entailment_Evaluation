In its written reasons, the Board indicated in clear and unmistakable terms why it did not believe the applicant. Moreover, the Board's decision is not simply based on the fact that the Board found it implausible that Mr. Jung would abduct the applicant two years after their last contact. The negative inferences drawn by the Board are based on numerous inconsistencies between the applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF), the applicant's testimony and a letter from her former friend/roommate (the Letter). For instance, the first factual version contained in the applicant's PIF only mentioned a fear of her former boyfriend and her current husband. In my view, the Board was entitled to consider it implausible that the applicant would forget or simply not mention the alleged kidnapping and rape incident. The Board could also consider the discrepancy between the applicant's story and the Letter regarding the two police interventions following the applicant's telephone calls in September 2000. In addition, the Board rightly took into account the fact that, regarding the alleged report to the police of the kidnapping/rape incident in March 2003, the applicant, once confronted with the factual version contained in her PIF, clearly changed her testimony without providing the Board with a valid reason for doing so. Furthermore, the Letter also contradicted the applicant's first testimonial version of the alleged report to the police in March 2003. The Board also had the right to use common sense to dismiss the applicant's story with respect to the alleged registration of a marriage and divorce by Mr. Jung without the applicant's knowledge. As for the applicant's stories in connection with her escape and her former husband, the Board could reasonably conclude that they were not credible based on the numerous implausibilities.
