 [13] 
  As noted by the Court of Appeal in  
 North v. West Region Child and Family Services Inc 
  2007 FCA 96, 362 N.R. 83 basing itself on  
 R v. Sheppard 
 , 2002 SCC 26, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, the obligation to give reasons is a requirement of procedural fairness. In this case the reasons were wrong, and it is neither for the Minister nor the Court to speculate as to how the officer would have exercised his discretion had he had his facts right.
