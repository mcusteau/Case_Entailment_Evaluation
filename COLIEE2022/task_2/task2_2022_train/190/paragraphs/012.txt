  We know from  
 Cardinal v. Kent Institution 
 , [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643, 24 D.L.R. (4th) 44 that the right to a fair hearing must be regarded as an independent, unqualified right, and it is not for the Court to deny that right on the basis of speculation as to what the result might have been had discretion not been exercised on wrong principles ( 
 Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Canada, 
  [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2, 137 D.L.R. (3d) 558.). In this vein, the Minister has now brought forth information with respect to Mr. Ugochukwu's sojourn in Italy, which had not been disclosed to Canadian Immigration officers. That information was not in the record before the decision maker and so cannot be considered.
