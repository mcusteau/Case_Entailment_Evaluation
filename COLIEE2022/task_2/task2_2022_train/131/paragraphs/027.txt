 [27] 
  However, even though the Board is not bound by statutory evidence rules, it is reasonable for the Board to refuse to give weight to information provided in anonymous letters. The source and the motives as well as the information provided by this type of letter cannot always be verified. Therefore, the information is not necessarily trustworthy. This Court cannot find any errors in this practice of the Board and does not find that it was patently unreasonable of the Board to refuse to consider this letter in the circumstances.
