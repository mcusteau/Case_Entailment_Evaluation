  Mr. Navarrete appealed from a refusal to approve the spousal application for permanent residence of his spouse, Ms. Mara Roselina De Jesus, and her children. The application was refused, pursuant to s. 4(3) of the former  
 Immigration Regulations, 1978 
 , SOR/78-172 (former  
 Regulations 
 ) because the visa officer held that Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus entered into the marriage primarily for the purpose of immigrating to Canada as a member of the family class and not with the intention of living permanently with Mr. Navarrete.
