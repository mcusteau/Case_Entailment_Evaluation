  The application was based on use in Canada by Searle Canada Inc. since at least as early as August 25th, 1986, in association with pharmaceutical preparations, namely tablets containing 200 mg of misoprostol as the active ingredient. The application was advertised in the Trademarks Journal on October 13, 1993. Apotex Inc. filed a Statement of Opposition on December 13, 1993, opposing the application on the following grounds: 
 
 
 
 "(a) the Application does not comply with s. 30 of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  in the following respects: 
 
 
 
 (i) the alleged trademark is not a trademark; 
 
 
 
 (ii) the alleged trademark has not been used with the wares referred to in the Application since the date claimed; and 
 
 
 
 (iii) the Application does not contain an accurate representation of the alleged trademark. 
 
 
 
 (b) the applicant is not the person entitled to the registration of the trademark pursuant to s. 16(1) of the  
 Act 
  in that at the date of first use, it was confusingly similar with trademarks namely, white tablets that had been previously used in Canada by the Opponent; and 
 
 
 
 (c) the proposed trademark is not distinctive of the applicant in that it does not distinguish the wares of the applicant from those of others. White tablets were and are, at all material times, common to the trade and had been used by others so that the wares of the applicant cannot be distinguished from others."
