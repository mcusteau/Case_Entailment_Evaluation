  Whether a trademark satisfies these three requirements is a question of fact to be determined by looking at all of the circumstances of a particular case.

 , [1986] 1 F.C. 357; 1 C.P.R.(3d) 214; 5 C.I.P.R. 10, at pp. 370-371 as follows: 
 
 
 
 "It is to be noted that a distinctive trade mark is one which links e.g., goods with a vendor so as to distinguish them from the goods of other vendors.
