  In  
 Morris (Philip) Inc. v. Imperial Tobacco Ltd. 
  (1985), 7 C.P.R.(3d) 254, at p. 270, this Court held that three conditions must be met in order to prove distinctiveness: 
 
 
 
 "... (1) that a mark and a product (or ware) be associated; (2) that the "owner" uses this association between the mark and his product and is manufacturing and selling his product; and, (3) that this association enables the owner of the mark to distinguish his product from that of others."
