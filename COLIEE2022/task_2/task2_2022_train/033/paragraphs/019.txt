  By 1996, Mr. DiTullio had established a new company, that is Nor-Fab. In 1996, solicitors for Nor-Fab wrote to R.L.P. alleging that R.L.P. was infringing the 469 Patent. This dispute was settled when the main purchaser of the mill hole products indicated that it would purchase from both Nor-Fab and R.L.P. Nor-Fab ceased to threaten infringement at that time.
