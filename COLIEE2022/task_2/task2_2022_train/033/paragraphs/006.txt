  Prior financing agreements made by Walter's Welding and Nor-Equip are relevant to the question of ownership of the 469 Patent. On December 3, 1986, Walter's Welding executed a security agreement with the Federal Business Development Bank ("FBDB") for a loan in the amount of $270,000. This security agreement provided for a charge over certain property of the company, including a charge on patents. In January, 1989, Nor-Equip obtained another loan of approximately $120,000 from the FBDB. The second FBDB security agreement was on the same terms, insofar as patents are concerned, as the 1986 agreement.
