  At the time when this letter was signed, the application for the 469 Patent was in the name of Nor-Equip. After Mr. DiTullio had been laid off by Nor-Equip (1990) in November 1992, he was alerted to the fact that the letter of June 30, 1992 had been registered in the Patent Office, in Canada, in April 1993. Once he became aware of these facts, Mr. DiTullio signed the written assignment to himself from Nor-Equip on May 21, 1993.
