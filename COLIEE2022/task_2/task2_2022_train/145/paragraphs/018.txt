  This Court has found that the obligation to consider all grounds for claiming refugee status extends even to grounds which the claimant may have failed to identify. In  
 Viafara v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 1526, at paragraph 6, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1914, Justice Dawson wrote: 
 
 
 
 [6] However, in  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 at pages 745 and 746, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that  
 the Board must consider all of the grounds for making a claim to refugee status, even if the grounds are not raised during a hearing by a claimant 
 . This flows from the direction at paragraph 67 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Handbook on Procedure and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status that it is not the duty of a claimant to identify the reasons for their persecution. [Emphasis added].
