 [2] 
  The applicants raise the following issues: 
 
 
 
 a) Did the Board err in failing to consider that the applicant is part of a particular social group, namely that of women from Haiti who have been raped, thereby failing to properly analyze her claim. 
 
 
 
 b) Did the Board err in finding that the applicant's extended stay in the United States is not commensurate with a subjective fear of persecution?
