  In the three-page decision rendered by the Board, there is no acknowledgement of a central aspect of the applicant's claim, being fear of persecution as a member of the social group of women in Haiti who have been raped. The failure to identity the relevant ground precludes any analysis the Board might have performed regarding the merits of that claim. The determination made by the Board that there is no nexus between the claim and a Convention ground is therefore unsubstantiated.
