The hearing before the panel accordingly went forward on September 23, 2002 and January 15, 2003. On the latter occasion the applicant, still represented by Ms. Doyon, with the panel's leave, altered his Personal Information Form and stunned the panel by announcing that he knew no member of the El-Nahda party, apart from Mr. Mohamed Zrig (see the decision mentioned in paragraph 4), whom he said he knew [translation] "by chance". Accordingly, everything the plaintiff had said up to that point about his ties to members of that organization was untrue.
