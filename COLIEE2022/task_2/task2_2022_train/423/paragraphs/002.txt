The applicant Mohamed Ziar Jaouadi, a national of Tunisia, claimed refugee status in August 2000 on political and religious grounds. In particular, he alleged he was beaten and tortured by the police in 1999 and 2000 because he was a practising Moslem and he was also suspected of being in contact with armed Islamist groups (such as the GIA). He alleged that the same authorities were still seeking him since he left the country without authorization. The applicant also feared returning to Tunisia because of his political opinions and his political activities in Canada.
