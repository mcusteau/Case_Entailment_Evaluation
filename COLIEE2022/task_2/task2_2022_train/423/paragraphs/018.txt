In this regard, in
Arthur v. Canada (Procureur général)
(2001), 283 N.R. 346; 2001 FCA 223, at paragraph 8, the Federal Court of Appeal indicated that mere suspicion and impressions by an applicant or his counsel about the actual or apprehended bias of a panel are not sufficient:
"An allegation of bias, especially actual and not simply apprehended bias, against a tribunal is a serious allegation. It challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard."
