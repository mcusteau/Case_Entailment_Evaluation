The evidence that Merck refers to in argument is found in the agreed fact and documents, Exhibit 1. Merck points out that Apotex's ANDS was submitted to the Minister on February 7, 2003, that Apotex's Notice of Allegation (Exhibit 1, Tab 5) is dated February 25, 2003, but apparently was not received by Merck until April 14, 2003. No excerpts from the discovery of Apotex were put in evidence that deal with these dates or the "delay", if any, in serving the notice of allegation.
