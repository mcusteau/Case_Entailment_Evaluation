Historically a number of countries, Canada among them, have been adverse to extending patent monopolies to food or medicines. Canada gradually retreated from this position, allowing patents directed to processes for making food or medicine, then restricting the prohibition to only certain types of medicines and finally, lifting the restrictions entirely. Most, but not all, countries have also lifted such restrictions.
