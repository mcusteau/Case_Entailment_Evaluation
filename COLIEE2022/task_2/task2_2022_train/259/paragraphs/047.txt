There have, of course, been numerous decisions of the Federal Court (Trial Division) commenting upon the
PMNOC Regulations
and section 55.2. I will refer only to one which deals with these
Regulations
and that section since those comments by Teitlebaum, J., which incorporate earlier comments by MacKay, J., have not been criticized or overturned. In
Fournier Pharma Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.
(1998), 154 F.T.R. 56; 83 C.P.R.(3d) 72 (T.D.), Teitlebaum, J., said at paragraphs 12 to 16:
"12. The new patent scheme, which comprises the
Patent Act
and the
Regulations
, has been considered by the Federal Court, namely, in
Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)
(1996), 71 C.P.R.(3d) 166, where the Court considered the validity of the
Regulations
.
"13. In
Apotex
, some of the issues are virtually identical to the present case. The Court considered, inter alia, whether the
Regulations
were ultra vires the authority of the Governor in Council pursuant to subsection 55.2(4) of the
Patent Act
. Further, the Court also considered Apotex's arguments that the regulations had been enacted without necessity and for collateral or ulterior motive, and that it was discriminatory. Mr. Justice MacKay found these arguments non persuasive and dismissed the application.
"14. In coming to this conclusion, Mr. Justice MacKay considered the scope of the regulatory powers conferred upon the Governor in Council by virtue of subsection 55.2(4) of the
Patent Act
and found that subsection 55.2(4) of the
Patent Act
conferred upon the Governor in Council ample discretion and authority to enact these
Regulations
. I have also reviewed the regulatory powers conferred upon the Governor in Council set out in subsection 55.2(4), in light of Fournier's arguments to the effect that the strict time limits are conditions which are not authorized by the enabling statute and are in effect unreasonable, unfair and unnecessary. In my view, Justice MacKay addressed some of these issues in
Apotex
. I quote and adopt the following passage from Justice MacKay's decision, at page 188:
'These submissions, in my view, mistake the purport of the words "as the Governor in Council considers necessary". Those words grant discretion to the Governor in Council to which a Court defers, recognizing that Parliament has left discretion to the Governor in Council. The exercise of that discretion would only be upset if it were established, and there is no such evidence here, that the Governor in Council did not consider the
Regulations
necessary. There is no onus on the Governor in Council to demonstrate necessity or even that necessity was considered. The mere act of adopting regulations establishes that they were considered necessary by the Governor in Council, at least so far as this Court's review is concerned. The words used relate to a matter for determination by the Governor in Council, whose beliefs are not subject to review. The words do not raise any question of an objective standard of necessity to be met or even considered.'
"15. Mr. Justice MacKay went on to review the decision in
Reference re Validity of Regulations in Relation to Chemicals
, [1943] S.C.R. 1. In
Chemicals
, supra, the validity of the regulations had been challenged on the basis that the Governor in Council was not empowered by virtue of the enabling provision to adopt the
Regulations
in relation to Chemicals. The Supreme Court of Canada reviewed section 3 of the
War Measures Act
which conferred upon the Governor in Council authority to pass the
Regulations
. Section 3 stipulated that 'the Governor in Council may do and authorize such acts and things, and make from time to time such orders and regulations, as he may ... deem necessary or advisable for the security, defense, peace, order and welfare of Canada'. Mr. Justice MacKay in
Apotex
, supra, at page 188, quoted a passage from the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in
Chemicals
, supra, where Chief Justice Duff said, at page 12:
'... when
Regulations
have been passed by the Governor General in Council in professed fulfillment of his statutory duty, I cannot agree that it is competent to any court to canvass the considerations which have, or may have, led him to deem such
Regulations
necessary or advisable for the transcendant objects set forth.'
"16. In my view, the above mentioned cases clearly show that a Court should hesitate to interfere with the Governor in Council's broad discretionary powers and authority. In this respect, counsel for Fournier argued at the hearing that the strict time limits under the said subsections allow generic drug manufacturers to enter the market despite a patent or license for the said drugs, and adduced evidence by way of affidavit - Application Record, tab 3, Affidavit of Tom Brogan - to the effect that the entry of generic drugs on the market can have substantial financial and commercial repercussions, most specifically on Fournier because it only manufactures the two mentioned drugs for which registration of a patent list was refused."
