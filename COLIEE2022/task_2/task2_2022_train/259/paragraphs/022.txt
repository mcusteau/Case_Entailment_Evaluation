Section 55.2(6) provided that any right to non-infringement in respect of private, non-commercial activity remained. In this last regard the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Micro Chemicals Ltd. v. Smith, Kline & French Inter-American Corp.
, [1972] S.C.R. 506 is to be noted in which it was held that experimental use without a licence in the course of bone fide experiments directed to whether a person could make a patented product was not an infringement of a patent.
