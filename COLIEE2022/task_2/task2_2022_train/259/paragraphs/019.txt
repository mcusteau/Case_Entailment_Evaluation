Nonetheless, until 1993, Canada included a scheme in its
Patent
Act
whereby an interested person could apply to the Commissioner of Patents (not the patent owner) and obtain a compulsory licence to sell a patented medicine in Canada. Almost invariably such a licence was granted and at the rate of 4% of the net price of a finished product or 15% for the bulk ingredient. This compulsory licence system was objected to by patentees, claiming that it diminished the rights of those holding patents claiming medicines as opposed to others who may have patents for instance for bicycles.
