In so reading, section 8(4), I appreciate that it may be said that I am reading the word "
lost
" to modify the word "
profits
" just as Rothstein, J., and others have done before. In this regard, I refer to Professor's Sullivan's 5th Edition of
Sullivan on the Construction of Statues
, 2008, LexisNexis Canada Inc., where, at pages 172 and 173, she refers to what she characterizes as the "Presumption of Perfection":
"
Presumption of perfection
. Legislation is presumed to be accurate as well-drafted; it is presumed that the legislature does not make slips of the pen. In
Commissioners for Special Purposes of the Income Tax v. Pemsel
, Lord Halsbury wrote:
'... I do not think it is competent to any Court to proceed upon the assumption that the legislature has made a mistake. Whatever the real fact may be, I think a Court of Law is bound to proceed upon the assumption that the legislature is an ideal person that does not make mistakes.'
"In theory, this idealization of the legislative drafter's work can be justified.
. . . . .
"Because mistakes inevitably occur, the presumption of perfection should be readily rebutted. It is a normal part of the judicial function to review the work of drafters and in appropriate cases make necessary corrections."
