In
Biolyse
, supra, Binnie, J., for the majority began his reasons by addressing the "
balance
" struck by the
Patent
Act
, between protection of intellectual property and constraint on health care costs. He wrote at paragraphs 1 and 2:
"1. Our Court has often spoken of 'the balance struck under the
Patent Act
' in which the public gives an inventor the right to prevent anybody else from using his or her invention for a period of 20 years in exchange for disclosure of what has been invented. As a general rule, if the patent holder obtains a monopoly for something which does not fulfill the statutory requirements of novelty, ingenuity and utility, then the public is short-changed. See
Whirlpool Corp. v. Camco Inc.
, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067; 2000 SCC 67; and
Free World Trust v. Électro Santé Inc.
, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024; 2000 SCC 66.
"2. In the present appeal, the Court is required to consider this 'balance' in the much-litigated field of patented medicines, where Parliament is concerned not only with the balance between inventors and potential users, but between the protection of intellectual property on the one hand and, on the other hand, the desire to reduce health care costs while being fair to those whose ingenuity brought the drugs into existence in the first place."
