[106]
With respect to subsection 8(1)(a) there is no provision for "
certification
" as such by the Minister or any definition in the
PMNOC Regulations
or elsewhere as to what such "
certification
" may mean. The parties have agreed, however, and I find that is reasonable to conclude that the date "
as certified by the Minister on which a notice of compliance would have been issued
", is the date of the letter sent by the Minister to the generic Apotex stating that the examination of its ANDS application has been completed but an NOC will not be issued until the requirements of the
PMNOC Regulations
are met, that is, until the then outstanding Court application T-844-03 is determined or withdrawn. In this case, that letter (Exhibit 1, Tab 7) is dated February 3, 2004. Thus, according to subsection 8(4)(a), the beginning date from which Apotex can claim compensation "
unless the court is satisfied on the evidence that another date is more appropriate
" is February 3, 2004.
