Merck's argument as to the so-called delay refers to the period between February 7, 2003 the date Apotex filed its ANDS (Exhibit 1, Tab 5) and the agreed date of service April 14, 2003 (Agreed Facts, paragraph 12, Exhibit 1, Tab A). Merck argues that, had the Notice of Allegation been served on the date that Apotex filed its ANDS, February 7, 2003 (Agreed Facts, paragraph 17) or very shortly thereafter, Merck would have been obliged by the
PMNOC Regulations
to file its Application with the Court within 45 days from the date of service and, had it done so, the disposition of these proceedings by the Court would have occurred some 66 days earlier than it did, therefore Merck's exposure to liability, given that the date of "certification", February 4, 2004 remains the same, would have been some 66 days less.
