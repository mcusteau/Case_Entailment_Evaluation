Merck launched several attacks on the validity of provisions of section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
and the jurisdiction of the Federal Court to enforce those provisions. Not all of these attacks were pleaded however. The issue of jurisdiction is not found in Merck's pleadings. Merck argues that a Court has inherent jurisdiction to entertain issues as to its own jurisdiction.
