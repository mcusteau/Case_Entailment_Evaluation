As to the two other criteria for jurisdiction as set out in
ITO
, supra, namely (2) an existing body of federal law, it is clear that both of the
Patent
Act
and
Federal Courts
Act
are such bodies of federal law and (3) that the law must be a law of Canada, it is clear that the
Patent
Act
and
Federal Courts
Act
are existing laws and laws of Canada. Both criteria are satisfied.
