Counsel for the parties are to be commended for co-operating in providing an agreement as to facts and documents (Exhibit 1). The Plaintiff, Apotex Inc., is what is known colloquially as a generic drug company which manufactures and markets primarily generic versions of pharmaceuticals in Canada. In the
PMNOC Regulations
, Apotex is referred to as a "second party". The two Merck Canadian companies Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. and Merck Frosst Canada & Co. (collectively referred to in these reasons as Merck) are the Canadian branch of a multinational organization which manufactures and markets are what are commonly referred to as "brand name" or "originator" or "innovator" pharmaceuticals and are what is referred to as "first persons" under the
PMNOC Regulations
. Merck & Co. Inc., a United States company, was named as a party defendant in this action but shortly before trial, an Order was issued, on consent, discontinuing this action against that entity.
