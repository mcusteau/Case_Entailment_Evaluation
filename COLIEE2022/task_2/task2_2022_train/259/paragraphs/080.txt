As to the first of these criteria, Dickson, J., at page 439 set out three further criteria to be considered:

(2) Is the action created of limited scope as opposed to a general cause of action; and
(3) It is to be recognized that the federal government is not constitutionally precluded from creating rights of civil action where such measures can be shown to be warranted.
