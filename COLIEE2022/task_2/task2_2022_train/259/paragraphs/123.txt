[123]
The success, or lack thereof, in respect of this portion of the trial is divided, each of the parties having largely failed to succeed on the issues asserted by them. This trial was greatly simplified by an agreement as facts and documents and the conduct of counsel during trial. Their co-operation with each other and the Court was exemplary. I find that it is most appropriate not to award any costs to any party for this portion of the trial.
