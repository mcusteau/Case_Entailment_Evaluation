Section 55.2 as passed R.S.C. 1993, c. 2, s. 4 provided that it would not be an infringement of a patent to use the invention solely for purposes of developing submissions for regulatory approval or for stockpiling. Section 55.2 was a so-called "
early working
" exception which is similar to such an exemption provided in United States legislation. However, the Canadian exception is unrestricted as to subject matter of the patent, it applies to medicines, bicycles and anything patented, and unrestricted as to any country not just Canada or province in which regulatory approval may be sought. The amendment also provided for "
stockpiling
" whereby, a person could make and stockpile patented products but not put them into the stream of commerce until the patent expired (sections 55.2(2) and (3)). These stockpiling provisions were removed in 2001. Section 55.2(4) provided a Regulation making authority. Section 55.2(5) provided that these provisions of the
Patent
Act
and any Regulations passed under them, would, in the case of conflict with other provisions of the
Patent
Act
or
Regulation
or any other
Act
or
Regulations
, have priority.
