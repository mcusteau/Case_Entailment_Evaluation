I find that Dr. Hollis' evidence is to be given no weight. It was not referred to in any written argument submitted by any party before trial, and scarcely referred to in skeleton argument submitted at trial or in oral argument at trial by any counsel. Dr. Hollis purports to address two questions from what he describes as an "economic perspective". The first is directed to whether, under the
PMNOC Regulations
, Apotex's remedy is limited to damages or whether it could claim disgorgement of Merck's profits. Dr. Hollis is not a lawyer, and even if he were, a Canadian lawyer's opinion as to Canadian law is not admissible in evidence for the purpose of interpreting that law. Even less admissible is the evidence of an economist. An exception may exist where a statute uses wording that is meaningful to those practicing a particular profession (
R. v. Manuel
(1982), 38 O.R.(2d) 321 (C.A.) at 352-6). However the views of an economist as to the economic incentives or otherwise that may be provided by a regulation is not helpful in interpreting those regulations and will be given no weight.
