[84]
Apotex argues that it is entitled, by way of relief in this action, to an election that would include either Apotex's damages or Merck's profits during the relevant period. It does so for a number of reasons:
1. Section 8(4) of the
PMNOC Regulations
provides for "
relief by way of damages or profits
" thus entitling Apotex to claim Merck's profits;
2. An award of profits accords with the scheme of the
Patent
Act
and the
PMNOC Regulations
; and
3. Section 20(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, provides that this Court can give a remedy at law or in equity respecting a patent.
