Nowhere does the word "
profits
" appear in the
Patent
Act
. There was considerable scholarly debate as to whether the provision for an "
account
" meant that a Court, in an infringement action, could, as an alternative to awarding damages to a patentee, order disgorgement of an infringer's profits. That debate was laid to rest by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Voith (J.M.) GmbH v. Beloit Corp.
(1997), 214 N.R. 85; 73 C.P.R.(3d) 321 (F.C.A.). Stone, J.A., for the Court discussed the question at pages 355 to 359 of the reported reasons and concluded that the remedy of disgorgement of an infringer's profits is expressly provided for in section 57(1)(b) of the
Patent
Act
, supra, when read together with section 20 of the
Federal Court Act
.
