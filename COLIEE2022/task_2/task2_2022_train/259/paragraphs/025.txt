The
PMNOC Regulations
first came into effect on March 12, 1993 (SOR/93-133). They were amended effective March 12, 1998 (SOR/98-166), again amended effective October 1, 1999 (SOR/99-379), against amended effective 5 October, 2006 (SOR/2006-242) and last amended effective June 12, 2008 (SOR/2008-211). It is important to note, particularly with respect to SOR/2006-242, that certain transitional provisions provide that certain amendments including some as to section 8 do not apply to actions commenced prior to the date of coming into force of the amendments. Those amendments came into force October 5, 2006. This action was commenced July 5, 2005. As a result, certain amendments pertaining to section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
made in October 2006 do not affect what is at issue in this action.
