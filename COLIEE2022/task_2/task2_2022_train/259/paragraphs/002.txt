The issues required to be determined at this time are twofold. The first deals with the jurisdiction of this Court, enablement and constitutionality of section 8. The second deals with the nature and extent of the remedies afforded by section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
. For the reasons that follow, I find that the Federal Court has jurisdiction to hear and determine actions instituted under section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
, that section 8 is properly enabled and that section 8 is intra vires the constitutional authority of the federal Parliament. As to the second, I find that the Apotex is not entitled to disgorgement of Merck's profits, if any; that Apotex is entitled to recover its damages or its lost profits, for the period from February 3, 2004 to May 26, 2005; and, that Apotex may claim recovery of damages that occurred during said period and extended beyond that period if said damage could not have been or were not rectified in that period. No party is awarded costs.
