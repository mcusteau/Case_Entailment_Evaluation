[102]
Section 20(2) of the
Federal Courts
Act
does not expand upon the remedies afforded by section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
. It enables the
Regulations
to include equitable remedies, but such remedies must be found in the Regulation. As I have stated above, I cannot find such a remedy in the
PMNOC Regulations.
