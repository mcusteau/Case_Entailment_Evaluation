The
Patent
Act
, section 55(1) provides that a person who
infringes
a patent is liable to the patentee and others "for all damages". Subsection 55(2) provides for "reasonable compensation" before a patent was granted, a matter examined by Snider, J., of this Court in
JAY-LOR International Inc. et al. v. Penta Farm Systems Ltd. et al.
(2007), 313 F.T.R. 1; 2007 FC 358; this a relatively new concept applicable to patents granted from applications filed after October 1, 1989 and not relevant to the present discussion.
