  However, with respect to patent cases specifically, Mackay J. in  
 Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser 
 , [2002] 19 C.P.R. (4th) 524 (QL) at para. 17, held that: 
 
 
 
 [...] To the extent that the volume of work was higher than usual, and actual expenses were much greater than recoverable under column III, those factors were in substantial part the necessary consequence of the nature of the patent in suit and the problems of evidence inherent from it to establish infringement. Costs reflecting these consequences should not be expected to be borne by the defendants in this case. In my opinion, they are an aspect of the plaintiffs' overall business expenses. Some inventions may be inherently more expensive to defend than others. In my opinion, that is a factor which should not be reflected in a higher than normal level of party-and-party costs awarded.
