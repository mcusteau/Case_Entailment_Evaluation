  As per  
 Apotex Inc. v. Syntex Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. et al. 
 , [1999] 2 C.P.R. (4th) 368 (FCTD) (QL), at para.4, partially overturned but not on this point at (2001) 12 C.P.R. (4th) 413 (FCA): "[...] the general philosophy is that party and party costs should bear a reasonable relationship to the actual costs of the litigation." Therefore the fact that the defendant has spent $326, 286.99 in fees and disbursements in defending the action should be taken into consideration.
