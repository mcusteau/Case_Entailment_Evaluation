While, as I said, I might have preferred some parts of the documentary evidence to other parts and might have given more weight to Mr. Islam's own testimony, I am satisfied that the Board considered all the evidence before it and made no patently unreasonable error. I can do no better than adopt the following passage from the decision of Blanchard J. in Meyer v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 878, where he said at paragraph 20:
...The applicant essentially argued that the Board afforded far too much importance to the documentary evidence and failed to properly consider the applicant's evidence. I reject the applicant's argument. There is nothing before me to support the contention that the Board has failed to have regard to the evidence before it. The applicant may not accept the Board's findings, but it is not the role of the Court on judicial review to re-weigh the evidence. It is also well established that the Board, an expert tribunal, is at liberty in assessing evidence to prefer documentary evidence over the testimony of an applicant. [Zhou v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1994] F.C.J. No. 1087 (QL)]. Based on the evidence before the Board, I do not find its credibility and plausibility assessments to be patently unreasonable.
