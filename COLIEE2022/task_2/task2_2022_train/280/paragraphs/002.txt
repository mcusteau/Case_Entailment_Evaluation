The Applicant is from the Guangxi Province of the People's Republic of China. He sought refugee protection due to the persecution he claimed to fear as a member of an underground Christian church. More specifically, the Applicant claimed that he was acting as the lookout for his church when it was raided by the Public Security Bureau [PSB]. The Applicant alleged that he escaped, went into hiding and that the PSB came to his home with a warrant for his arrest. The Applicant also claimed he learned shortly thereafter that another member of his church was arrested, so he decided to flee to Canada to make a refugee claim.
