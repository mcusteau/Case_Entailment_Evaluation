As for the Applicant's second argument, it was perfectly reasonable for the Board to have not considered the other photographs in the Record. Turning, first, to the Record of Re-Testing and Re-Assessment, the photograph contained in the copy of that document which was filed with the RPD was so blurry that it could not establish anything. More importantly, though, what was at issue in terms of the Applicant's identity for purposes of his refugee claim was whether he was present in Guangxi Province in 2009, when the alleged persecution by the PSB was claimed to have occurred. The Record of Re-Testing and Re-Assessment was totally irrelevant to this central issue as it was issued in 2007. Likewise, the family photograph was of no utility in establishing the Applicant's identity as it had no names on it - the family photo could well be of the Applicant but that does not mean he is who he claimed to be.
