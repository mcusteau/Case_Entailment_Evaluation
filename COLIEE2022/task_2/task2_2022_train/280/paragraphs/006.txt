In argument, counsel for the Applicant conceded that if I were to find that the Board's identity finding was reasonable, it is not necessary to address the other errors that were asserted because the RPD's reasoning on the three impugned points was inter-related and because the case law recognises that the failure of a claimant to establish his or her identity before the RPD affords the Board the basis to dismiss a refugee claim in its entirety. Counsel is correct in this regard. Section 106 of the IRPA provides that the RPD "... must take into account, with respect to the credibility of a claimant, whether the claimant possesses acceptable documentation establishing identity, and, if not, whether they have provided a reasonable explanation for the lack of documentation ... ". It is firmly-settled that if a claimant does not establish his or her identity, the Board need not consider the merits of a putative refugee's claim and may reject it out of hand (
