The first point raised by the Applicant can be disposed of very quickly as the case law firmly establishes that the RPD is empowered to make a finding that an individual is - or is not - the person in the photograph in a piece of identity documentation filed by a claimant and need not have resort to expert testimony before making such a finding (see, for example,
Kazadi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2005 FC 292 at para 12, [2005] FCJ No 349;
Santos v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2007 FC 1119 at para 22;
Flores v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2005 FC 1138 at para 9;
Akindele v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] FCJ No 68, 2002 FCT 37 at para 5;
Hossain c Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)
, [2000] FCJ No 160, 102 ACWS (3d) 1133 at paras 4-5;
Tshimanga v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] FCJ No 891 at para 22; and
Tcheremnykh c Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)
, [1998] FCJ No 1310) at paras 9-10). Thus, it was not unreasonable for the Board to have made the determination in question concerning the Applicant's identity without expert evidence.
