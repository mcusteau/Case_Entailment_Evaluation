The representative of the Wolf Lake Band, Chief St. Denis, introduced the letter into evidence in an attempt to establish that the Band's finances were indeed in a precarious state and to show good faith in the dismissal of Ms. Young. Because the Band was not represented by counsel, the adjudicator was in a difficult position. No one was available to scrutinize the evidence of the employer and therefore, Mr. Brault was the first person who could have advised Chief St. Denis that putting the letter into evidence might have both positive and negative consequences. This type of situation is the result of the more informal proceedings under the
Code
. However, informal procedures cannot be an excuse for allowing the adjudicator to appear biased. The fundamental question remains the same: would a reasonable and right-minded person who was well informed as to the issues believe that the adjudicator was biased? (See
