I raise this point because counsel for the respondent in these proceedings objected to the fact that the employer did not raise the issue of a reasonable apprehension of bias until the supplemental hearing. However, I must state clearly that the party alleging bias has an obligation to raise the issue only once he or she knows or ought to know of its existence. In this case, Chief St. Denis represented the Employer at the first hearing and it is he who put the letter at issue into evidence. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to hold that the applicant ought to have known of the potential for bias prior to having retained legal counsel. Counsel for the employer raised the issue at the next hearing before the adjudicator. Although counsel for the respondent would have preferred to have had more than two days' written notice of the bias allegations, I do not see that any prejudice has been suffered.
