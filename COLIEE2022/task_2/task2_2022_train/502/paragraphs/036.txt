The applicant raises two issues with respect to the substance of the supplementary award. First, the applicant alleges bias in that counsel for the respondent improperly revealed facts to the adjudicator in a letter dated March 14, 1995. Second, the applicant alleges that the quantum of damages awarded is far in excess of what should have been awarded in these circumstances and was based on factors applicable to an award of punitive damages.
