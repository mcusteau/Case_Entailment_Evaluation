[34]
The text of the interim award is reproduced at paragraph 10 of this decision. From that text it is clear that the adjudicator interpreted the cancellation of LAMBAT funding for the position of education liaison officer as evidence of the similarity to the two positions. This evidence was then used to conclude that the position occupied by Ms. Young had not been discontinued. It was not used to find any unjustness in the dismissal as the applicant alleges, but it was used to find a continuation of a function. Furthermore, the adjudicator refers to the LAMBAT decision to cancel the funding and not to the position apparently adopted by Labour Canada. Although the letter supported the adjudicator's decision with respect to similarity of positions, it was not in itself sufficient to create a reasonable apprehension of bias.
