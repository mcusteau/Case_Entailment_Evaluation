Sedpex Inc. v. Browne and Devereaux
, [1989] 2 F.C. 289; 25 F.T.R. 3 (T.D.), Strayer, J. (as he then was), stated for the court at p. 299 [F.C.]:
"Nor does it mean that because the employer says that he no longer needs the employee in question the termination of employment must automatically be regarded as due to 'lack of work'. Difficult as it may be in some cases, the question which the statute requires to be answered, in my view, is as to whether the actual operative and dominant reason for the termination was 'lack of work'."
Thus, when faced with an employer claiming that an employee has been terminated because of a lack of work or discontinuance of a function, the adjudicator must first examine the merits of the employers' claim. If the adjudicator determines that the employee was let go for one of these two valid reasons then the adjudicator will not proceed further. However, when an adjudicator determines that the explanation offered by the employer is not valid, the adjudicator has the jurisdiction to do a full enquiry into the circumstances surrounding the dismissal.
