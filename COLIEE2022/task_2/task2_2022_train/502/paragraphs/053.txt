[53]
An adjudicator awarding damages for unjust dismissal is entitled to set the amount of the award. The award is intended to compensate the employee for damages actually suffered as a result of the dismissal. While there is discretion in the amount of damages that may be awarded, an adjudicator commits an error when he or she limits the amount of the award to the amount of severance to which the employee would be entitled if the dismissal had been a justified one based on s. 235 or the common law.
