Common sense dictates that the adjudicator is not required to simply accept the employer's statement that the employee was laid off for the reasons described in s. 242(3.1)(a). If that was indeed the effect of that paragraph then the adjudicator's role would effectively be eliminated because any employer faced with an adjudication under s. 242 of the
Code
would simply have to give the above explanation, and since no examination could then be done, the issue would be closed. In this respect, the adjudicator's decision quoted infra addresses the jurisdiction issue. On the basis of the record, I find that the adjudicator was correct in finding that the employer's allegation of discontinuance of a function was not supported. As a consequence, the adjudicator properly had jurisdiction to hear and determine the merits of Ms. Young's claim.
