Counsel for the applicant also referred to s. 242(2)(c) which reads:
"(2) An adjudicator to whom a complaint has been referred under subs. (1)
(c) has, in relation to any complaint before the adjudicator, the powers conferred on the Canada Labour Relations Board, in relation to any proceeding before the Board, under paragraphs 16(a), (b), (c)."
Counsel for the applicant stated to the court that, on the basis of the foregoing provision, s. 18 is implicitly applicable to an adjudicator appointed under s. 242. Unfortunately, I cannot possibly agree.
