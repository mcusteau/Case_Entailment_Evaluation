An allegation of bias must be raised at the first possible opportunity. As Muldoon, J., stated in
West Region Tribal Council v. Booth et al.
(1992), 55 F.T.R. 28 (T.D.), at p. 46:
"A nullity ab initio can be perceived and declared almost at any later time for it never was of any effect, and demonstrably so. However, when one alleges a denial of natural justice by means of alleged prejudice, one should - nay, must - so allege promptly, for effluxion of time can render such allegation not objectively demonstrable at all. The allegation of prejudice should not be secretly harboured, but made public immediately, thereby hoping to catch the tribunal 'red handed', so to speak, in its prejudice and misconduct. So it is that the posture of waiting to discover whether one wins the contention before the adjudicator, prepared to make no allegation of prejudice if one does win, and complaining of alleged prejudice as a means of trying to avoid a confirmed loss, is abusive and to be discouraged."
