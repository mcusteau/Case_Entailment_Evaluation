An employee may be terminated in one of three ways, each giving rise to different remedies under the
Code
: with cause; for administrative reasons; or termination without cause. An employee terminated for cause is not entitled to any of the remedies provided for in ss. 242 and 235. If the termination is the result of a lack of work or discontinuance of a function, the employee is entitled to receive severance pay, but is not entitled to receive compensation provided for pursuant to s. 242. Finally, an employee terminated without just cause is entitled to be
fully compensated
for the unjust actions of her employer.
