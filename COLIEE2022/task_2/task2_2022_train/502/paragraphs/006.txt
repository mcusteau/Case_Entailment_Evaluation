The respondent filed a complaint of unjust dismissal against the Band Council. Mr. Brault wrote two decisions in this case. The first decision dealt with the merits of the claim of unjust dismissal. The second decision determined the quantum of damages which the employer was required to pay to Ms. Young. This judicial review proceeding has been brought to address perceived problems with each decision respectively. For reasons which will soon become obvious, I will deal with each decision in its turn.
