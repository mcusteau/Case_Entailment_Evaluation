At the end of the Interim decision the adjudicator reserved to himself jurisdiction in the following manner:
"I have not heard evidence nor arguments by the parties on the issue of remedy should the complaint be allowed. Hence, I will not make any determination on the issue at this point as it was agreed with the parties that in this event, they would first try to agree on the proper remedy and that I would remain seized with the issue. Accordingly, I will remain seized of my jurisdiction until March 17, 1995. If the parties do not agree on a proper remedy to Ms. Young's dismissal in the meantime, either of them may notify me in writing of their failure to agree and a new hearing will be convened to allow me to hear and determine the issue."
