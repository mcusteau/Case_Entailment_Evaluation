With respect to the Band's financial situation, the record reveals a "Combined Statement of Income and Expenses" for the Band Operations Fund from year end of March 1990 to year end of March 1992. [see footnote 2] The applicant's position is that one-half of the respondent's salary was paid from fund 4210 which showed a deficit for year end 1992. However, the date of the latest financial records was almost two full years before the respondent was dismissed. There are no records for the budget from which the balance of the respondent's salary was paid; a budget which the adjudicator found was not transferable nor related to the government account for which records were submitted. Additionally, as the adjudicator stated at p. 7:
"... no convincing evidence was adduced to establish the precise circumstances of the decision to abolish Ms. Young's position in relation to that deficit. The only evidence offered in this respect shows that the janitor's position was abolished and consolidated with that of manager. Even though the Band's initial reply to the complaint referred to Ms. Young's seniority, it did not adduce any evidence to show that seniority was ever considered."
This supports a finding of unjust dismissal as the burden of justifying the dismissal lies with the employer.
