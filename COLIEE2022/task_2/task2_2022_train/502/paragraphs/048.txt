Part III, Division XIV of the
Code
is titled "Unjust Dismissal" and provides for a remedy in unjust dismissal cases. Section 242(4) of Part III provides:
"(4) Where an adjudicator decides pursuant to subs. (3) that a person has been unjustly dismissed, the adjudicator may, by order, require the employer who dismissed the person to
(a) pay the person compensation not exceeding the amount of money that is equivalent to the remuneration that would, but for the dismissal, have been paid by the employer to the person;
(b) reinstate the person in his employ; and
(c) do any other like thing that it is equitable to require the employer to do in order to remedy or counteract any consequence of the dismissal."
These are the only remedial provisions under Division XIV of the
Code
.
