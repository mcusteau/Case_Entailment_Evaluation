  Of particular concern is the Adjudicator's failure to consider the significance and validity of the CFIA's characterization of its decision which was consistently stated to be non-disciplinary. The Adjudicator also failed to consider the effect of the CFIA's decision on Dr. Frazee beyond pointing out that a more appropriate review plan was probably available. In addition, the Adjudicator failed to consider whether the CFIA's decision was taken in response to what it saw as culpable or corrigible conduct by Dr. Frazee and was intended thereby to have a corrective aspect.
