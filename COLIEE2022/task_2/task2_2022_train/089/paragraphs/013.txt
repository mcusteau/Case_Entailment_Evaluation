  The Adjudicator could only assume jurisdiction over Dr. Frazee's grievance if he found that the CFIA's treatment of Dr. Frazee constituted a form of discipline resulting in a suspension. At the time, this adjudicative authority was conferred by s. 92(1) of the  
 Act 
  which read: 
 
 
 
 "92(1) Where an employee has presented a grievance, up to and including the final level in the grievance process, with respect to 
 
 
 
 (a) the interpretation or application in respect of the employee of a provision of a collective agreement or an arbitral award, 
 
 
 
 (b) in the case of an employee in a department or other portion of the public service of Canada specified in Part I of Schedule I or designated pursuant to subsection (4), 
 
 
 
 (i) disciplinary action resulting in suspension or a financial penalty, or 
 
 
 
 (ii) termination of employment or demotion pursuant to paragraph 11(2)(f) or (g) of the Financial Administration Act, or 
 
 
 
 (c) in the case of an employee not described in paragraph (b), disciplinary action resulting in termination of employment, suspension or a financial penalty, and the grievance has not been dealt with to the satisfaction of the employee, the employee may, subject to subsection (2), refer the grievance to adjudication. 
 
 
 
 Approval of bargaining agent 
 
 
 
 "(2) Where a grievance that may be presented by an employee to adjudication is a grievance described in paragraph (1)(a), the employee is not entitled to refer the grievance to adjudication unless the bargaining agent for the bargaining unit, to which the collective agreement or arbitral award referred to in that paragraph applies, signifies in the prescribed manner its approval of the reference of the grievance to adjudication and its willingness to represent the employee in the adjudication proceedings. 
 
 
 
 Termination under P.S.E.A. not grievable 
 
 
 
 "(3) Nothing in subsection (1) shall be construed or applied as permitting the referral to adjudication of a grievance with respect to any termination of employment under the Public Service Employment Act. 
 
 
 
 Order 
 
 
 
 "(4) The Governor in Council may, by order, designate for the purposes of paragraph (1)(b) any portion of the public service of Canada specified in Part II of Schedule I."
