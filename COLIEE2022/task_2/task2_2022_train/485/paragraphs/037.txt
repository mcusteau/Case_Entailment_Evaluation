For example, in
Haghighi
, the Federal Court of Appeal held that an officer making a decision on an H & C application had an obligation to disclose that a risk opinion was obtained from a PCDO because the applicant did not know that such an opinion was being sought from another officer and did not have an opportunity to respond. Sharlow, J.A., in
Bhagwandass
adopts the language from
Haghighi
to note that whether disclosure is required should be centred around the goal of ensuring that the person affected by the decision is afforded "... a reasonable opportunity to participate in a meaningful manner in the decision-making process ...".
