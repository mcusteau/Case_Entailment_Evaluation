The applicant submits, however, that the Federal Court of Appeal in
Chu (H.V.) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.C.J. No. 554; 270 N.R. 149 (F.C.A.), overruled its earlier decision in
Nadarajah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] F.C.J. No. 283; 237 N.R. 15 (F.C.A.). Since the Federal Court of Appeal in
Nadarajah
applied
Mancia
, the applicant argues that, by extension,
Mancia
is also overruled. The applicant relies on the following statement by Rothstein, J.A., in the Federal Court of Appeal case of
Chu
, supra at paragraph 10:
"As noted earlier, the certified question in this case related to whether there was a duty to disclose country information documents to the appellant that had been neither specifically identified nor previously provided to him. The answer with respect to the Ministerial Opinion Report is equally applicable to other documents submitted by Ministry officials to the Minister's delegate. Any documents submitted to the Minister's delegate by Ministry officials acting in an adversarial role to the appellant must generally be disclosed to the appellant, or at least must be specifically identified if the documents are generally available. In this respect, prior decisions such as
Chu (T.T.) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1998), 225 N.R. 378 (F.C.A.), leave to appeal refused by Supreme Court of Canada, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 330, (1998), 236 N.R. 387, and
Nadarajah v. Canada (MCI)
(1996), 33 Imm. L.R.(2d) 234 (F.C.T.D.), have been overtaken by
Baker
and
Bhagwandass
."
