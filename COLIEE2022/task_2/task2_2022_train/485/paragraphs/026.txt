McKeown, J., has recently had occasion to consider the impact of the
Chu
decision in
Khanam et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1497; 213 F.T.R. 78 (T.D.). The decision under review before McKeown, J., was that of a PCDO who had relied on a document regarding general country conditions that post-dated the applicant's submissions. McKeown, J., considered the decision in
Chu
and distinguished it from the matter before him. He noted that
Chu
concerned the duty of fairness within the context of the danger opinion process. He then contrasted the PDRCC process with the danger opinion process noting the adversarial nature of the latter and that there is no lis inter partes in the PDRCC process. As well, unlike the danger opinion process where ministry officials submit reports to the decision maker, the PCDO does not obtain reports from third parties adverse in interest to the applicant. He remarked that in the PRDCC context applicants are informed at the outset what documents will be relied upon in the decision-making process. He also noted the fundamental difference between the PDRCC and danger opinion contexts in that a PDRCC decision does not necessarily facilitate the removal of an applicant. Therefore, having distinguished the danger opinion process from the PDRCC process, McKeown, J., held that, with respect to the duty of fairness owed by the PCDO, the approach articulated in
Mancia
still applies.
