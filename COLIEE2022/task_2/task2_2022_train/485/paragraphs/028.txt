I do not accept this argument. First, as argued by the respondent, the decision in
Chu
is limited on its facts to the danger opinion process. Second, Rothstein, J.A., referred to the Federal Court, Trial Division, decision in
Nadarajah
and not to the subsequent decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the same case. In the Trial Division reasons in
Nadarajah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1996] F.C.J. No. 649; 112 F.T.R. 296 (T.D.), the Court framed the issue as follows:
"The issue in this judicial review is whether information on country conditions that was not in the applicants' immigration files, but is considered in a PDRCC risk assessment, constitutes extrinsic evidence requiring the Post-claim Determination Officer to inform the applicants that such information would be considered, and provide them with an opportunity to respond."
