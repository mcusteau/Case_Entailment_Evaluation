The respondent maintains that all the documents relied upon by the PCDO were either submitted by the applicant or were publicly available at the time the applicant filed her submissions. Accordingly, the duty of fairness did not require disclosure of the documents prior to a decision being reached. The respondent is correct with respect to the factual assertion. Although there was some confusion about the exact date the Burton Report became available to the public, it is clear that it was made available after the date the applicant's refugee claim was rejected and before the dates the applicant filed her application and submissions for consideration as a member of the PDRCC class.
