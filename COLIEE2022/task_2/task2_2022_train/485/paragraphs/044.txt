Therefore, as stated earlier, I do not accept the applicant's argument that
Chu
overrules
Mancia
, however, I do accept the argument that the approach to disclosure as articulated in the earlier jurisprudence has been altered by the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
Baker
and subsequent decisions of this Court. However, I am not satisfied that the principles of fairness as enunciated in
Baker
,
Haghighi
and
Bhagwandass
extend so far as to require disclosure in the circumstances of this case. In other words, the PCDO was not obligated to disclose publicly available documents describing general country conditions of which the applicant is deemed to have been aware in advance of rendering her decision.
