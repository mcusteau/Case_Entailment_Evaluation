In closing, I note for the record that Mrs. Mindich was not present for the hearing of the appeal. The Affidavit of Service of the Notice of Application does not establish that Mrs. Mindich was personally served with the Notice of Application. However, she subsequently filed a Notice of Appearance indicating her intention to oppose the application. Pursuant to rule 147, I am prepared to validate service on the ground that the filing of the Notice of Appearance is evidence that the Notice of Application came to Mrs. Mindich's attention. Mrs. Mindich was advised of the date of the hearing by the Registry by ordinary mail. Counsel for the Minister advised the court that her office had received a call from someone on behalf of Mrs. Mindich indicating that she was concerned about the appeal and did not know what to do. She was apparently advised to contact the Federal Court for more information. There is no indication in the file of any contact being made with the court.
