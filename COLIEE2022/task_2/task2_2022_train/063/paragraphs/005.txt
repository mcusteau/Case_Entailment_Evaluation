 [5] 
  I do not accept the submissions of counsel for the applicant that this appeal under section 56 of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  is not governed by Part V of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
 , 1998. I do not accept the implied argument of the applicant that Part V applies only to the manner in which an appeal under the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  is instituted, that is by way of application for judicial review rather than by the filing of a notice of appeal. The wording of Rule 300(d) is clear. There is nothing to limit the manner in which the rules set out in Part V apply to appeals under the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  and consequently, Rule 303 applies to the conduct of the within appeal.
