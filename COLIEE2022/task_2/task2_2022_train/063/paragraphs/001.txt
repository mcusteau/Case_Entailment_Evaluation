 Heneghan, J. 
 : This is a matter being appealed from a decision of the Registrar of Trade-marks. It was heard on March 15, 2000. There was a preliminary issue concerning the status of the Registrar of Trade-marks, whether he was the proper respondent in this matter having regard to Rules 300 and 303 of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
 , 1998. Rules 300(d) and 303 provide as follows: 
 
 
 
 "300. This Part applies to ... 
 
 
 
 (d) appeals under section 56 of the Trade-marks Act ... 
 
 
 
 "303(1) Subject to subsection (2), an appellant shall name as a respondent every person 
 
 
 
 (a) directly affected by the order sought in the application, other than a tribunal in respect of which the application is brought; or 
 
 
 
 (b) required to be named as a party under an Act of Parliament pursuant to which the application is brought. 
 
 
 
 "(2) Where in an application for judicial review there are no persons that can be named under subsection (1), the applicant shall name the Attorney General of Canada as a respondent. 
 
 
 
 (3) On a motion by the Attorney General of Canada, where the Court is satisfied that the Attorney General is unable or unwilling to act as a respondent after having been named under subsection (2), the Court may substitute another person or body, including the tribunal in respect of which the application is made, as a respondent in the place of the Attorney General of Canada."
