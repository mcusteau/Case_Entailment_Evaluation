  An appeal by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to the Federal Court of Appeal was dismissed, on the grounds that absent a provision in the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
  there is no right for the Tribunal whose decision is under review to enjoy party status in the subsequent proceeding; see  
 Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada (Attorney General) and Bernard 
 , [1994] 2 F.C. 447; 164 N.R. 361 (F.C.A.).
