  The first question to be considered in this appeal is the applicable standard of review. In  
 Molson Breweries v. John Labatt Ltd. 
 , supra, Mr. Justice Rothstein commented on the appropriate standard to be applied in appeals under the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  and said: 
 
 
 
 "... even though there is an express appeal provision in the Trade-marks Act to the Federal Court, expertise on the part of the Registrar has been recognized as requiring some deference. Having regard to the Registrar's expertise, in the absence of additional evidence adduced in the Trial Division, I am of the opinion that decisions of the Registrar, whether of fact, law or discretion, within his area of expertise, are to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness simpliciter. However, where additional evidence is adduced in the Trial Division that would have materially affected the Registrar's findings of fact or the exercise of his discretion, the Trial Division judge must come to his or her own conclusion as to the correctness of the Registrar's decision." Ibid. at para. 50.
