  Given the low threshold that must be met to support a membership finding under subsection 34(1) of  
 IRPA 
 , the Officer's conclusion that Mr. Kanapathy's work for the  
 Murasoli 
  supported the LTTE was reasonable. Mr. Kanapathy has acknowledged that the  
 Murasoli 
  supported and was controlled by the LTTE. Moreover, the documentary evidence affirms the links between the  
 Murasoli 
  and the LTTE and discusses the importance of media propaganda to the LTTE's activities.
