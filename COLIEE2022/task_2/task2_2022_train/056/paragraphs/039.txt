  I acknowledge Mr. Kanapathy's argument that a certain amount of interaction with the LTTE may have been inevitable in LTTE-controlled areas of northern Sri Lanka during the period in question. However, it seems to me that those submissions may be better advanced in the context of an application for a Ministerial exemption under subsection 34(2) of  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
