  Mr. Kanapathy asserts that the Officer erred in finding that his actions were sufficient to deem him to be a member of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). He contends that the issue of his membership in the LTTE had already been decided by this Court in a related proceeding. Mr. Kanapathy also argues that he worked as a journalist in Sri Lanka, and that any journalistic contribution that he may have made to the LTTE should not be considered to exclude him under any law in Canada.
