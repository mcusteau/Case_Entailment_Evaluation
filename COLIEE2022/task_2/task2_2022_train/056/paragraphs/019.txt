  Exclusion under Article 1F of the Refugee Convention is very different than inadmissibility on security grounds under section 34(1) of  
 IRPA 
 . The former requires a determination of whether there are serious reasons for considering that an applicant was complicit in the commission of a war crime, a crime against humanity, or an act contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The issue in a section 34(1) inadmissibility case is whether the individual is a member of an organization for which there are reasonable grounds to believe has engaged in acts of terrorism. These are different issues with different tests.
