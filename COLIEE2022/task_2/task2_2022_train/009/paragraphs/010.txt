  This case concerns a decision to refuse a visa. The decision was clearly made by the visa officer, as he avers in his affidavit. This is supported by the affidavit of the IPO and further by the applicant's own affidavit which acknowledges that when she was advised of the decision to refuse her application she was told that the immigration officer made the decision, not the IPO.
