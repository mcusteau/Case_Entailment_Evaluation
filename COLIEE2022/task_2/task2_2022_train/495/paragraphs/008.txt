The applicant left the north of Sri Lanka with both her children because she feared for their safety and their future. The LTTE had confiscated her 25 acre coconut palm plantation and was threatening to take her children to train them as LTTE supporters. Her children were 12 and 15 at the time. In Colombo, she paid an agent 500,000 rupees (described as a "small fortune") to conduct the three of them out of Sri Lanka and into Canada. Her husband had deserted her in 1980 and thus the nuclear family unit comprised only the three individuals. The agent, just before the date of leaving, told her that he did not have the papers for her son's journey immediately available, but the son would follow and they would meet in Singapore. This did not happen. This same agent told the applicant that although she had a valid passport which covered both herself and her two children that she should leave it behind in Sri Lanka. The agent provided her with a false passport. The applicant does not know exactly where her son is now but received a letter from him, recently, saying he is in hiding in Colombo and is afraid.
