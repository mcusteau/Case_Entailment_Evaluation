With respect to the arguments concerning prejudgment, it is necessary, first, to quote the remarks which gave rise to this allegation:
"I know, yes. But, I should make one thing clear since you've been so upset through the hearing, we've heard many Sri Lankan claims. I won't go through the documents which relate to your country. You must know, the Tamil Tigers, the other extremists, they torture, mutilate and murder people. There are thousands or tens of thousands of these murderers in your country. You are not one of these people. I can't even imagine a person remotely considering or perceiving you to be one of these people. Your claim is based on your fear that the Sri Lankan authorities might find out that your plantation has been confiscated. It simply appears, quite frankly, outrageous, your fear that you would be arrested at the airport in Colombo, tortured and killed. So, I'd just like to put at rest, at least for the little that remains of the hearing, of the emotional turmoil you seem to be going through because of this separation 'cause your lawyer will make submissions in writing on all of the aspects of your claim. But, for the rest of the hearing, try and maintain your composure. Do you understand?"
