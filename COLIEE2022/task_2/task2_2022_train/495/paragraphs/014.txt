The applicant and her children came from the north of Sri Lanka to Colombo. Then they moved into a lodge, across the street from the railway station. They stayed ten days, after which the applicant and her daughter left, with the agent, for Canada. She had no previous connection with Colombo. The factors on which the Board relied in coming to its conclusion that Colombo was a reasonable IFA for the applicant were not discussed at the hearing. The basis of the conclusion that those factors demonstrate that Colombo is a reasonable IFA for the applicants is not clear from either the transcript or the Board's decision.
