 [34] 
  After analyzing the evidence and the two impugned decisions, the Court finds no error in the decisions and must conclude that the PRRA officer, who had some expertise, could reasonably find that the PRRA application and the H&C application should both be refused based on the evidence she had analyzed. The two decisions to which these proceedings relate fall with a range of possible, acceptable outcomes and are completely defensible in respect of the facts and law; they are therefore reasonable and entitled to deference by this Court.
