Counsel for the Applicants conceded before me that, given the factual background in this matter, Officer Bauly's decision, if she had simply and categorically refused any further review of compassionate and humanitarian considerations, would most likely have been unassailable. But, she argued, having undertaken a further review, having demonstrated compassion if you will, she then had to respect the duty to act fairly, at least to the minimum standard of that duty which, it was argued, required Officer Bauly to advise the Applicants of the case against them and provide them an opportunity to reply to that case. This minimum standard of fairness could have been met, it was argued, if Officer Bauly or her superiors had acceded to the request of the Applicant's solicitors for a telephone conference call that would have involved, presumably, Officer Bauly, the decision maker, and her medical advisor and the Applicants' solicitors and their medical advisor, Dr. Golda. The Applicants' solicitors and Dr. Golda held themselves ready for such a call throughout the critical day of the 16th of April, 1993.
