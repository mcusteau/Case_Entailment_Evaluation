A preliminary issue was raised before me. Counsel for the Respondent objected to the admissibility of exhibit "B" to the Affidavit of Dr. Bronte Golda sworn the 27th day of April 1992, that exhibit being a copy of a report dated the 22nd day of April, 1992 by Dr. Michael T. Newhouse, and to all portions of the affidavit of Dr. Golda and of the affidavits of John C. Munro sworn the 20th day of April, 1992 and the 29th day of April, 1992 that in any way make reference to or rely on the report or the forthcoming report of Dr. Newhouse.
