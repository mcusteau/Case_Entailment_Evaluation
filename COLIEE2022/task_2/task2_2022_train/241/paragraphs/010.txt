On the 15th day of October, 1991, without either of the foregoing reports having been brought to his attention, through no failing on the part of the Respondent or his or her officials I should point out, the second humanitarian and compassionate review resulted in a decision against the Applicants in the following terms:
"This letter refers to the request you have made on behalf of the above mentioned individuals for a review of their personal circumstances in consideration of the decision for their removal from Canada.
"First, I would like to apologize for the undue delay in responding to your submission. I can only say that several reasons such as policy procedure changes, and a backlog or work in our office, have contributed to a great degree.
"Further, your submission for review is comprehensive and encompassing and I have taken some time to consider all the points you have outlined in your package.
"As you know, when a review for Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds is requested, the reviewing officer is guided by Chapter 9 of the Immigration manual.
"I must consider and determine if there are any unusual, undeserved, or disproportionate hardships that would be caused to the person(s) seeking consideration if he, she, they, had to leave Canada.
"With regards to the case before me, I must advise you that I have carefully considered all aspects of this family's circumstances and have determined that there are insufficient reasons to warrant processing of an application for landing from within Canada.
"I realize that this decision will come as a disappointment to you and your clients, however I do feel that the Lemiecha family should have much better than average success in meeting the requirements through the normal processing of an immigrant application abroad, should they decide to do so."
