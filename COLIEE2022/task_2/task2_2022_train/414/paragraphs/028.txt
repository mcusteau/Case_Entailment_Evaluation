The applicant submits that it does not appear that art. 19.26(16) was brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal in
Anderson
. Counsel argues that it is clear from art. 19.26(16) that the
Q.R.&O.
and specifically the grievance procedure under art. 19.26, was not designed to prevent a member of the Armed Forces from seeking a remedy before the courts. I cannot agree with this view. Article 19.26(16) simply provides, in my view, that a redress authority must suspend "any action in respect of the complaint" when the person who submitted the complaint has instituted an action, a claim or a complaint under an Act of Parliament.
