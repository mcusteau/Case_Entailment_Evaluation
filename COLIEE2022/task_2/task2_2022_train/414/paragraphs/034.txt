The respondent submits that the total period of obligatory service herein is 110 months which commenced immediately after the applicant completed his graduate studies. Thus, according to the respondent, the applicant, at the time of his application for release under FRP-96, had already completed his obligatory service incurred as a result of his undergraduate studies. Therefore, when the applicant applied for early release, the period of obligatory service relating to his undergraduate studies could not be waived as it had already been served.
