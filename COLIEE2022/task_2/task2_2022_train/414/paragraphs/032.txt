It is not disputed that the applicant incurred 110 months of obligatory service. At the time of his release application, the applicant had served 55 months of obligatory service. As of the time of the present application, he had served 65 months. The applicant contends that as 55 of these months were served in an engineering position requiring a Master's degree, he had, at the time of his application for release under FRP-96, already served the 50 months which he had undertaken to serve in respect of his graduate studies. Consequently, he argues that the remaining 55 months constitutes obligatory service in respect of his undergraduate studies and FRP-96 provides that such service is waived "for approved applicants".
