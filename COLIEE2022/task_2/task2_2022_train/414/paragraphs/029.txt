Put another way, the redress authority must suspend until such time as the court of law has decided the issue brought before it by the complainant. Paragraph 16 cannot be taken to mean that a member can, at his discretion, abandon the grievance process provided under art. 19.26. He must, in my view, follow that process unless the circumstances are such that the process does not constitute an adequate alternative remedy. In the present case, no such circumstances have been brought to my attention. I am therefore of the view that the respondent must succeed on this point.
