[26]
I do not see how I can distinguish the facts in
Anderson
from the facts in the present matter. There is no evidence before me regarding those factors which Mr. Justice Stone considered in coming to his conclusion, i.e., the time, the costs and the stress of pursuing the complaint through the chain of command. Consequently, like Mr. Justice Stone in
Anderson
, I am of the view that the process prescribed by s. 29 of the
National Defence Act
and art. 19.26 and 19.27 of the
Q.R.&O.
affords an adequate alternative remedy.
