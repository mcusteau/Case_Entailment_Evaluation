Mr. Justice Stone then examined whether the remedy afforded to the member, pursuant to the redress of grievance procedure set out at art. 19.26 of the
Q.R.&O.
, constituted an adequate alternative remedy. He pointed out that the motions judge had concluded that the remedy was inadequate because of the time required to pursue the complaint through the chain of command and by reason of the "cost and stress for the respondent in so doing". Although he recognized that the time required to pursue the matter by way of judicial review would probably be less than that required to pursue the matter through the grievance process, at 357, Mr. Justice Stone concluded that:
"In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the factor of delay is not such as to warrant the court's intervention at this stage."
