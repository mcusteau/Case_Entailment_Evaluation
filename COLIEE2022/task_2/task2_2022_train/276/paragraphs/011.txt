This argument is academic. Regardless of the standard of proof, it could have made no difference to the findings in this case. The RPD based its findings on the balance of probabilities that there was not a serious possibility of persecution: "Nothing in the evidence before me indicates that should the principal claimant's mother return to Albania, on balance of probabilities, there is a serious possibility that she would be targeted for persecution". This is not an incorrect formulation of the relevant test, although the sentence may be somewhat awkwardly worded. The board also found that there was "no reason to believe that she should be in any way targeted" and "no reason to believe that ... she should face any more likelihood than her son in Albania of persecution or of risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual punishment". Thus, the threshold for the disputed burden of proof was not engaged because the board found there was no evidence to find any kind of risk.
