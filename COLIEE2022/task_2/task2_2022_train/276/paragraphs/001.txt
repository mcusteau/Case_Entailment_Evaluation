Layden-Stevenson, J.
: Before coming to Canada, Mrs. Brovina, a 71-year-old Albanian citizen, lived with her son and his wife in Albania. She claims a well-founded fear of persecution based on her membership in a social group - a family member of her son, Fisnik Brovina, who based his claim on political belief. Mrs. Brovina's personal information form (PIF) narrative stated that she relied upon her son's narrative. Her son's narrative in turn incorporated the incidents recounted in his wife's narrative. The claims of Mrs. Brovina's son and daughter-in-law were joined with her claim.
