In
Bouaouni v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 717; 2003 FC 1211, Mr. Justice Blanchard discussed this issue in the context of a situation where identity was not disputed, but the country conditions might lead to an objective fear (though still based on personal circumstances) of s. 97 risk, even if the subjective fear was found to be not credible. Justice Blanchard noted the distinction between s. 96 and s. 97 claims and stated that although the evidentiary basis may be the same, the claims should be considered as separate. Most importantly, for present purposes, he stated, "Whether a Board properly considered both claims is a matter to be determined in the circumstances of each individual case bearing in mind the different elements required to establish each claim". Although the board had erred in failing to specifically analyze the s. 97 claim, its error was not material to the result in that case.
