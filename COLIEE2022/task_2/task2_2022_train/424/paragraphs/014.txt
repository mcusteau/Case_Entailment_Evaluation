Secondly, counsel's argument rests on the erroneous assumption that the application of s. 49(1)(b) is dependent upon the Appeal Division having jurisdiction over the appeal. This assumption is not supported by the language of s. 49(1)(b). Pursuant to that paragraph, it is the filing of an appeal with the Appeal Division, and not the jurisdiction of the Appeal Division, which triggers the statutory stay. The stay remains in force until either: 1) the appeal is heard and disposed of; or 2) the appeal is declared by the Appeal Division to be abandoned. Section 49(1)(b) does not provide for the cessation of the statutory stay where a "danger to the public" opinion is issued. Had Parliament intended that the application of the statutory stay under s. 49(1)(b) be confined to situations where the person against whom a removal order was made has a right of appeal to the Appeal Division or where a "danger to the public" opinion had not been issued, it could have easily done so. In fact, Parliament has expressly broadened the application of s. 49(1)(b), by contrast with s. 49(1)(a). In s. 49(1)(a), there is a qualification that the person in question must have a right of appeal to the Appeal Division. There is no such qualification under s. 49(1)(b). At the same time, all of s. 49(1) is subject to s. 49(1.1), which excludes the application of s. 49(1) in certain specified situations. However, s. 49(1.1) does not extend to the situation where the Appeal Division has lost jurisdiction by virtue of the issuance of a "danger to the public" opinion.
