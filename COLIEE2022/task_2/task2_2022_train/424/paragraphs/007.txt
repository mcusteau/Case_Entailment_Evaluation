Counsel for the respondent, relying on
Tsang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1997), 211 N.R. 131 (F.C.A.), argued that the statutory stay under s. 49(1)(b) does not apply to the applicant because the issuance of the "danger to the public" opinion extinguished the jurisdiction of the Appeal Division in this matter. He further argued that a discretionary stay is not warranted as the facts of this case. He conceded that the applicant's application for leave and for judicial review gives rise to a serious triable issue. However, counsel for the respondent submitted that there is no evidence of irreparable harm should the applicant be returned to Guatemala and that because of the applicant's criminal conduct, the balance of convenience favours the removal of the applicant.
