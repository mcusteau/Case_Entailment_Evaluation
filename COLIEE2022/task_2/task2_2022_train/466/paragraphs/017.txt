Vorvis v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085; 94 N.R. 321; [1989] 4 W.W.R. 218; 58 D.L.R.(4th) 193; 36 B.C.L.R.(2d) 273; 90 C.L.L.C. 14,035; 25 C.C.E.L. 81, Mr. Justice McIntyre wrote at p. 1104 [S.C.R.]:
"Problems arise for the common law wherever the concept of punitive damages is posed. The award of punitive damages requires that:
'... a civil court ... impose what is in effect a fine for conduct it finds worthy of punishment, and then to remit the fine, not to the State Treasury, but to the individual plaintiff who will, by definition, be over-compensated. (Waddams, p. 563.)'"
Was the remedy imposed here, then, punitive in nature or akin to punitive damages? In answering the question I have posed, I will ignore the word "deception", which might well be more appropriately "disappointment", in the portion of the reasons of the Tribunal quoted above. I will, nonetheless, requote the last paragraph of the reasons that appears earlier in these reasons.
"I am also concerned by the number of cases dealt with by members of this Board where the wishes of employees are set aside for considerations consistently found to be improper in assessing operational requirements. Some of those cases were cited to me in this hearing. The employer has struck a bargain and must abide by it. In these circumstances, I feel a lesser order than the one I am making would not sufficiently address the concerns stated above, and I note that my remedial authority is broad indeed;
