I read the foregoing quoted paragraph as indicating that the remedy awarded by the Tribunal derives at least as much from the conduct of the employer over a "number of cases" as from the conduct of the employer in the matter that was under adjudication before the Tribunal. In effect, the Tribunal is saying: this respondent is going to receive a remedy, not calculated by reference to the damage or loss that he has suffered, but rather by relation to a standard designed to ensure that, in future cases, the employer abides by the bargains that it has struck. In effect, the Tribunal is imposing a remedy, for conduct it finds worthy of punishment, with the respondent herein, as opposed to the State Treasury, being the beneficiary with the effect that the respondent will, by definition, be over-compensated.
