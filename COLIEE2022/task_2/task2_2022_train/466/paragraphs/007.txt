Article 17.07 of the collective agreement reads as follows:
"An employee's vacation shall normally be taken in the fiscal year in which he/she becomes eligible for it. The Employer shall,
subject to the operational requirements of the service
, make every reasonable effort:
a) to schedule an employee's vacation leave for at least two (2) consecutive weeks, if so requested by the employee not later than May 1st;
b) to give next priority to periods of vacation for which a request is made by employees prior to June 1st;
c) subject to (a) and (b) above, to schedule an employee's vacation leave at a time acceptable to him;" (underlining added by me for emphasis)
