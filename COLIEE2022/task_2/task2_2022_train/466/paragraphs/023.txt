In summary then, both on the basis that the Tribunal, in making the award in favour of the respondent that it did, exceeded its jurisdiction and that it erred in law in awarding a remedy in the nature of punitive damages, I conclude that this application for judicial review must be allowed. An order will go accordingly, referring the matter back for determination and award of a remedy within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and not of a punitive nature.
Application allowed.
