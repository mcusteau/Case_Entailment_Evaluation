I wrote in
Richmond et al. v. Canada (Attorney General)
((1996), 108 F.T.R. 205 (T.D.) under appeal)):
"I am satisfied that in certain circumstances, the arbitrator could find resort to the leave with pay provisions of the collective agreements to be required in order to comply with the nondiscrimination provisions of the collective agreements, and that in those circumstances the collective agreements would not be violated, nor would section 96(2) be transgressed. In this regard, I agree with the position advanced on behalf of the applicants. The adjudicator was required to interpret the collective agreements as a whole and not in abstract, apart from the nondiscrimination provisions."
