The Adjudicator considered the factor of the disparate treatment of Captain Kmet and First Officer Scanlon to be the one factor that mitigated most strongly against upholding the dismissal. He summarized his findings in this regard at pp. 63 and 64 of his decision:
"I am persuaded without doubt that Captain Kmet has been singled out for arbitrary and harsh treatment by the employer when compared to the treatment given to the other members of the flight crew. Simply put, in order to appease the unhappiness of Mr. Rendle over the delay in the return flight from Sandspit to Vancouver, the grievor was singled out for discharge by the employer in order to retain the business of the customer which it was successful in doing for the balance of the season.
"The failure of the company to treat Captain Kmet in the same manner as the other crew members of the flight crew, subject only to some consideration for a longer suspension because he was pilot-in-command, constituted, in my judgment, a form of discrimination. Nothwithstanding the protestations of company witnesses that safety of the crew and public was the key element in its decision to terminate Captain Kmet's employment, its real motive, in my view, was not safety but a desire to mollify the concerns of the customer. To appease him, it offered up Captain Kmet for sacrifice but not First Officer Scanlon or the other two flight attendants."
