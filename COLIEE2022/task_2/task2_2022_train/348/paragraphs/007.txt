On June 30, 1995, Captain Kmet was dismissed from his employment on the grounds that he had breached an alleged company rule that members of the crew were not to consume alcohol within eight hours of their report for duty time. In addition, the applicant took the position that Captain Kmet had breached the abstention from alcohol requirements under the
Air Regulations
made pursuant to the
Aeronautics Act
which stipulates that no person shall act as a crew member of an aircraft within eight hours after the consumption of an alcoholic beverage. First Officer Scanlon received a two week suspension for his conduct.
