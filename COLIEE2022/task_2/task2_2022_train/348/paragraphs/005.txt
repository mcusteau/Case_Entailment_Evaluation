Prior to that time, and unbeknownst to Captain Kmet, Mr. Rendle had spoken by telephone with officials of Kelowna and had arranged a 6:00 a.m. departure the next day, June 19, 1995, thereby permitting the passengers, who were primarily businessmen on a fishing trip, to return to Vancouver the next morning in time for work. Mr. Rendle was aware that Ian Scanlon, the First Officer, was in agreement with this plan. However, upon being advised of the plan on June 18 at 9:00 p.m., Captain Kmet rejected the departure time, as was his right as Captain, on the grounds that it would not permit the crew the eight hours prone rest prior to report for duty as required by the
Aeronautics Regulations
. Mr. Rendle was extremely displeased with the respondent's position.
