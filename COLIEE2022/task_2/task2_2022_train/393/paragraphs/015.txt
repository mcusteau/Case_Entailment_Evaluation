While one cannot blame counsel for retaining a number of experts in a case of such importance, it appears to me that it would create a dangerous precedent to allow full taxation of an expert, the main thrust of whose evidence is to give legal opinions (even though in the final outcome his views were sustained by the Court of Appeal). Such matters must be left for the court. At this late date, and without ordering a transcript of the evidence it is difficult to break down his evidence into the portions which were factual or with respect to which he had the right to express an opinion and the portions which involved legal opinions. His account refers inter alia to attending for a half day in Toronto for which he claims travelling and overnight expenses of $525.00 from Ottawa which appears to be excessive for the time involved. His claim for $2,645.00 fees for conferences with defendant's counsel, carrying out searches for designs in the patent office, reviewing his affidavit and additional conferences and telephone discussions and attending for a half day in Toronto may perhaps be reasonable within the meaning of s. 4(2) of Tariff A. I believe it would be reasonable to tax one half of his total bill of $3,170.00 or an amount of $1,585.00.
