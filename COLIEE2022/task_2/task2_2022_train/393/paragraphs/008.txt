On the other hand it is by no means unusual to tax one senior and one junior counsel in a matter of this importance. The junior counsel in this case who resides in Toronto and is a member of the firm of senior counsel who resides in Ottawa, did much of the preparation and the legal research including the preparations for challenging the credentials of one of the plaintiff's expert witnesses, which submissions he presented at trial. I find therefore that one senior counsel and one junior counsel can properly be taxed in this case.
