No application was even made, however, within the 10 days following the judgment of the Court of Appeal. Solicitors for the plaintiff, Bayliner Marine Corporation sought leave to appeal the decision of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, and according to the submissions of the defendant, it deemed it inappropriate to make a motion for special directions as to costs since the decision might go to the Supreme Court of Canada. It was not until December 18, 1986 that the Supreme Court of Canada refused leave to appeal. The judgment of the Court of Appeal therefore became final. The present motion was only produced on February 27, 1987 however, unavoidable delays having occurred during January and February owing to the physical locations of relative material and the absence of the chief officer of the defendant. There is considerable doubt in my mind as to whether this is a valid excuse as preparation for a special order could have been commenced while awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court as to whether leave to appeal would be granted or not.
