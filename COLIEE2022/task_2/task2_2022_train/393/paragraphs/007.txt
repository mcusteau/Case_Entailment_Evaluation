Defendant seeks counsel fees for two senior and one junior counsel both for the preparation and the conduct of the hearing and for disbursements incurred in connection with the attendance of two senior counsel at the hearing. Defendant submits that the word counsel as used in s. 2(1) of Tariff B is both singular and plural as was held in the Spur Oil case. In the present case, one of the witnesses had to be examined in the French language and since neither he nor the junior counsel were fluent in it an additional senior counsel was retained to prepare the witness' testimony and to conduct it. It was submitted that fees of this additional senior counsel for preparation for the hearing and conduct of it as well as disbursements incurred in connection with it should be allowed. In answer to this, plaintiff points out that the court provides simultaneous translation where required and in a bilingual country the engaging of an additional senior counsel for dealing with a French speaking witness would not be a proper item to include in costs. Defendant counters that, by retaining a French speaking lawyer to conduct the preparation and examination of the witness for the trial a disbursement for a translator prior to trial was avoided. I have no hesitation in concluding that it would set a dangerous precedent to justify the taxing of an additional counsel merely to assist the principal counsel and his junior who are not sufficiently familiar with one or the other of the official languages, as the case may be, to prepare or examine a witness in that language, and that if such assistance is required at trial, as it may well be in many cases, provision in the rules for simultaneous translation provides for this.
