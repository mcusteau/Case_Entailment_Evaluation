  The applicant takes no issue with the Board's formulation of the applicable legal tests to determine whether the applicant had an internal flight alternative, and was therefore not a refugee within the meaning of the Convention. Nor does he allege that, on the evidence before it, the Board's findings of fact that the applicant faced no serious possibility of persecution outside Mexico City and that it was not unreasonable for him to relocate elsewhere in Mexico, were made in a perverse or capricious manner. Rather, he says that, by failing in their reasons to mention and address the applicant's evidence that he saw what he thought were police vehicles outside the house in Toluca where he stayed in the spring and summer of 1996, the Board's finding that on the balance of probabilities there was no possibility that the applicant would be persecuted outside Mexico City was erroneous and made "without regard to the evidence".
