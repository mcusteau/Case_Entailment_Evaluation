The RAD concluded that the Applicants' subjective reluctance to seek police protection did not rebut the presumption that it exists and that they had not provided clear and convincing evidence that, if they were to make a complaint against Subhas, state protection would not be available to them. In my view, the RAD's finding was reasonable and to come to a different conclusion would be to re-weigh the evidence that was before the RAD which is not the role of this Court (
McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission)
, 2013 SCC 67 at paras 19-33;
Dunsmuir
at para 47).
