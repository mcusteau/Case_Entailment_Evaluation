The male and female Applicants claim that while Subhas and the female Applicant were married Subhas was abusive and that when they divorced in 2002, she was awarded sole custody of the children. When Subhas discovered that Mamta and Sanjay Verma had married, he threatened them. The family moved about 60 kilometers away from their home in Delhi and had no further contact with Subhas until 2013 when he located and contacted them. In particular, the Applicants describe an encounter outside their daughter's school with Subhas, accompanied by six tall Sikh men who the Applicants claim were "fanatical Sikhs". The male and female Applicants went to the school and confronted Subhas who said that he wanted to take Cheheleena back and that she should marry a Sikh. Further, because she was attending a good school, she would make a good salary in the future, and, as her father, he was entitled to that money. The male Applicant called the police who attended but stated that they did not want to be involved in a private matter concerning religion. After the police departed Subhas threatened to kill the female Applicant, but the Applicants did not report his threat to the police. The Applicants claim that following this incident they received phone threats and, in 2014, Subhas came to the Applicants' home with three Sikh men. The police were called and attended but did not register a case.
