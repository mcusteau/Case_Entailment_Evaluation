The Applicants submit that the RAD erred by rejecting the Riback and Choi Reports as the hearsay nature of self-reporting is an insufficient ground on which to reject medical evidence (
Lainez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2012 FC 914 at para 42 [
Lainez
]). Further, while the RAD noted that the Choi assessment was incomplete, it did not note the reason for this being that the female Applicant was in distress and indicated that she was not able to continue. The RAD's finding that the female Applicant's mental state may not have been caused as a direct result of her experiences in India is unreasonable, given the findings of the Choi Report. Finally, the Applicants submit that the fact that the Choi Report makes the same diagnosis as the Riback Report is not a reason to undermine the former, but rather speaks to the strength of the evidence, as corroborated by two separate mental health professionals.
