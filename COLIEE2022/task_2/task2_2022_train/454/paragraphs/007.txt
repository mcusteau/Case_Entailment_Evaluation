On the IFA issue, the RAD referred to the two pronged test as set out in
Rasaratnam v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1992] 1 FC 706 (CA) [
Rasaratnam
]. In assessing whether there was a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA, the RAD found that the evidence did not support that Subhas was the type of person who would have the ability to locate the Applicants among millions of people in major centres located long distances from his home. Further, there was no persuasive evidence adduced to establish that he had used any advanced technology in pursuit of the Applicants nor that he had access to police resources or the ability to influence police actions.
