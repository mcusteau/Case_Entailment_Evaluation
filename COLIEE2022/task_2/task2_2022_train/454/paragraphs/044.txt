In any event, in its state protection analysis the RAD acknowledged that the objective evidence in the record on state protection was mixed. That evidence included information concerning gender based violence. It is well established that decision-makers are presumed to have considered all of the evidence on the record (
Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board)
, 2011 SCC 62 at para 16) although that presumption may be rebutted by a failure to expressly consider evidence that directly contradicts the decision. In my view, however, that is not the situation in this matter. Here the RAD was aware of the mixed nature of the evidence and weighed the Applicants' testimony of their personal encounters with police against the mixed objective evidence. It noted, for example, that while the female Applicant claimed that the police did not seem interested in assisting her, her testimony indicated that they attended at the school when called and that they acted appropriately. They spoke to her and her husband, gathered information and informed her that if there were additional problems she should attend at the police station and file a First Information Report. She did not do so. And, after the second incident at her home, the police again attended. While the male Applicant's affidavit asserts that the family was not happy with the response, he also stated that he had not complained to a higher authority as he thought the police were too busy.
