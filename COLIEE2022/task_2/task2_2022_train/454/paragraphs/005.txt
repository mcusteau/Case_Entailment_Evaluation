The Applicants' claim for refugee protection was denied by the RPD on December 2, 2014. The determinative factor was the credibility of their claim. The RPD found that the Applicants had provided an insufficient explanation as to why the male Applicant's name appeared on the children's birth certificates and found that it was more probable than not that he was their biological father. Further, that the Applicants had not established that Subhas was Ankush and Cheheleena's father or that he existed and was targeting the Applicants. The RPD assigned little weight to a report from a psychotherapist, Natalie Riback, dated November 18, 2014 ("Riback Report") because its author had relied on the information provided by the female Applicant in preparing the report. The RPD did not believe the events as alleged by the Applicants nor that they were targeted as they claimed. In the alternative, the RPD found that even if Subhas were persecuting the Applicants, they had access to an internal flight alternative ("IFA"). The Applicants' claim was again denied on June 3, 2015 on appeal to the RAD.
