The RAD also reviewed and considered the Riback Report which stated that the female Applicant suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"), generalized anxiety and a major depressive disorder. The RAD noted that it was based on a single 60-90 minute interview and self-reporting and did not refer to any clinical testing. The RAD found that, without an explanation of the clinical basis on which the psychotherapist's opinions were formed, they amounted to speculation based on what was related by the female Applicant to the psychotherapist. The RAD also placed little weight on the Choi Report for several reasons: the assessment was terminated early at the request of the female Applicant and was, therefore, a clinical impression made without a full review of her situation; the diagnosis was the same as found in the Riback Report, both of which were based on self-reporting; and, the issues that caused the female Applicant to seek further medical intervention were not necessarily the direct result of the problems encountered in India. Further, the Applicants had not provided persuasive evidence that the female Applicant would be unable to obtain the recommended treatment in the proposed IFA locations. The RAD found that there was no compelling psychological or psychiatric evidence that the two female Applicants would be unable to return to India in an IFA location.
