  On 2 December 1985, Scanner filed its Part VIII tax return and reported that 50% of the designated amounts was $15,055,500 (the amount should have been $15,050,500). This represents Scannar's Part VIII tax liability pursuant to subsection 194(1). The third parties to whom the shares or debt obligations subject to the designations were issued were entitled to claim tax credits equal to 50% of the amount (these credits were claimed by Hayes-Dana Inc., Combustion Engineering Superheater Ltd. and Chieftain Products in their returns). In its return, Scannar also indicated that it paid to the Receiver General $8,700,000 on account of the tax liability arising from the designations. Finally, Scannar indicated that it incurred a total of $27,869,383 in scientific research expenditures pursuant to section 37(1) of the  
 Act 
 . This amount includes $25,000,000 resulting from a contract dated 27 November 1985 with Proteus Bio-Research Corporation to provide research and development services in connection with the production of certain products. As a result, Scannar claimed a Part VIII refund of $8,837,761.
