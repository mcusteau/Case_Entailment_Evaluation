 [22] 
  Finally, the plaintiffs argue that the decision of the Associate Senior Prothonotary was based on the view that the defendant's objections are based on the notion of estoppel -- that is that the plaintiffs are estopped from relying on the application of s. 194(4.2) -- and that this is an argument that should more properly be considered by the trial judge (Plaintiffs' Outline, supra, paragraphs 10 and 23). There is no evidence before me other than the Plaintiffs' Outline as to what the reasons were for the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision. However, it is not necessary to consider the issue of estoppel to determine this appeal.
