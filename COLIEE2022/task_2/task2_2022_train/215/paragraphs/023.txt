  The defendant's submissions are based on the view that the amendments constitute a withdrawal of an admission. The Minister maintains that the amendments result in severe prejudice and that this prejudice cannot be compensated by costs. In support of this submission, the defendant argues that the designations were acted on in good faith by the Minister and that it allowed, as a result of these designations, scientific research and experimental development tax credits to be claimed by the third party investors pursuant to s. 127.3 in the total amount of $14,500,000. The Minister submits that the operation of s. 152(4) prevents it from reassessing these companies unless there is evidence of misrepresentation attributable to neglect, carelessness or wilful default or evidence of fraud. No such evidence was presented by the plaintiffs in support of the motion. As such, if the plaintiffs are permitted to change their position and succeed at trial, the Minister is left in the position of having lost the tax payable by the third party investors which was offset by the tax credits and, at the same time, of having lost the Part VIII tax payable by the plaintiffs as a result of the designations.
