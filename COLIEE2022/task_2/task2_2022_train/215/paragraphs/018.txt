  On this issue, the plaintiffs maintain that the defendant cannot establish that the order allowing the amendment was based on the application of a wrong principle or a misapprehension of the facts. They also submit that the order does not determine any issue vital to the final decision in the case, "but rather is allowing the trial judge to decide the action on the basis of all the facts of the case" (Plaintiffs' Outline of Argument on the Motion to Appeal, at paragraph 14). Counsel for the defendant argues the opposite.
