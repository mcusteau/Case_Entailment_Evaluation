  By notice of motion dated 8 April 1993, the plaintiffs applied for leave to amend the statement of claim. The principal amendments raise the issue regarding the validity of the designations made pursuant to s. 194(4) of the  
 Act 
 . On 19 April 1993, the Associate Senior Prothonotary allowed the application without reasons and the Minister filed a notice of motion on 3 May 1993 to appeal this decision. The motion was heard by me on 27 September 1993.
