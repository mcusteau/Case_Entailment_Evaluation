 [24] 
  On the issue of the timeliness of the motion, the defendant submits that there is no reasonable explanation for the withdrawal of the admission and change in position. It is submitted that the explanations that the admission was inadvertent, that the plaintiffs acted promptly to correct the error, and that the plaintiff Orenstein was not advised by its solicitor that the designations might not be valid are insufficient. The defendant maintains that the plaintiffs were aware of the possible issue regarding the validity of the designation as early as 14 November 1984 when counsel for the plaintiffs wrote to the Minister for an opinion about the proposed Combustion Engineering Superheater Ltd. transaction. The same firm filed the original statement of claim and reply.
