  Because Associate Senior Prothonotary Giles did not provide any reasons for his decision it is difficult to determine whether he erred by applying a wrong principle or misapprehending the facts of the case. However, such a determination is not necessary since I am of the opinion that the order raises a question "vital to the final issue of the case". In my opinion, this is a case where the court ought to intervene and exercise its discretion de novo because the amendments, if allowed, would create a whole new cause of action. Implicit in many of the plaintiffs arguments in support of the necessity for the amendment is the view that the amendments are necessary because they put into issue the validity of the designation and a negative finding on this question will relieve Scannar from any liability for the payment of any Part VIII tax for the 1985 taxation year (Plaintiffs' Outline, supra, paragraph 7). Clearly, the issues raised by the amendments are vital to the final resolution of the case. However, this does not mean that the amendments should or should not be allowed, merely that I ought to examine the amendments and exercise my own discretion.
