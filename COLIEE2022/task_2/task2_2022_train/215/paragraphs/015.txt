  As mentioned above, during the hearing on the motion the Minister consented to proposed amendments limiting the action to an appeal of the assessment for the 1985 taxation year. Other amendments consented to included those which limited the action to an appeal of the disallowance of the $25,000,000 expenditure resulting from the Proteus contract and those which "cleaned up the other points" to be dealt with. As such, I will limit my review of the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision to the proposed amendments relating to the validity of the designations made pursuant to s. 194(4).
