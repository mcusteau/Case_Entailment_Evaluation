With respect to the first relief requested, the defendant relies on passages from the examination for discovery of the plaintiff with respect to the story which the plaintiff alleges he wrote and in respect of which he has brought this action for breach of copyright. In various passages in the examination for discovery the plaintiff says that he wrote in longhand many pages of notes outlining (with what particularity he has not said) a story, with names and characters, of small furry bipeds brought from outer space to earth known as "Ewoks" and "Olaks". He further said on examination that he had sent these notes to a Mr. David Hurry who at his request turned this material into a script, apparently for movies or television. At the plaintiff's request, but without the plaintiff seeing the finished script, Mr. Hurry submitted it to the defendants. The defendants rely on this examination for discovery as an admission that, in effect, the plaintiff is not the author of the script, "Space Pets" for the alleged use of which the defendants are being sued. In effect they contend that the answers given on examination for discovery indicate that at most the plaintiff was author of certain ideas of which Mr. Hurry, whom he admits actually prepared the script, made use. The defendants contend, rightly, that mere ideas cannot be the subject of copyright.
