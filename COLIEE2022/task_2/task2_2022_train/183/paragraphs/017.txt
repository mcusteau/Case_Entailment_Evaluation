  The applicant claims that all parties to the international treaty-transfer process had previously agreed that his six and a half year U.S. federal sentences would merge with his Utah state life-sentence upon his transfer back to Canada. As such, the federal sentence would be served concurrently with the state life sentence. However, once the applicant was transferred back to Canada his state sentence had been revised to a 25 year sentence. The applicant submits that although the state sentence had changed, the parties to the international treaty-transfer process had already agreed that his federal sentence would be served concurrently to his state sentence. As such, the applicant claims that the CSC erred in deciding that the federal sentences would be served consecutively and not concurrently.
