  The State of Utah's decision to change the applicant's sentence into a determinate one was taken after he had been transferred to Canada. The applicant admitted at the hearing that once he was transferred to Canada it would be extremely unlikely that upon his release he would ever be allowed to return to the United States. The State of Utah was cognizant of this situation at the time it decided to change the applicant's sentence to a determinate one. It is mere speculation on the part of the applicant to argue that having remained in the United States he would have been released at an earlier date.
