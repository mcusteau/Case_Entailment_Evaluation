  As mentioned above, s. 127(3) of the  
 Corrections and Conditional Release Act 
  indicates that the statutory release date occurs once the offender completes two thirds of his or her sentence. The applicant claims that the two thirds period should have begun once he started his sentence in Utah. As such, he claims that the CSC erred in calculating the two thirds period from the time the applicant arrived in Canada as a result of the transfer.
