Subsequent to my order with respect to the motion for non-disclosure, the same issue was raised before my colleague Mr. Justice von Finckenstein. He too applied the procedure dictated by subsection 87(2) of the
Act
for reasons reported as
Mohammed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2006), 302 F.T.R. 184; 2006 FC 1310. I agree with and adopt those reasons as my own.
