The jurisprudence of this Court with respect to the determination of whether an entity is a terrorist organization was summarized succinctly by my colleague Mr. Justice Mosley in
Jalil
, cited above. There, he wrote at paragraphs 22 through 25:
"22. The Court has dealt with the issue of 'terrorist' organization in
Fuentes v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 540 (F.C.T.D) (QL). Mr. Justice Fran√ßois, J., Lemieux noted that in
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; 2002 SCC 1 the Supreme Court of Canada had provided both a functional and a stipulative definition of the term 'terrorism.' The function approach consisted of defining terrorism by reference to specific acts of violence (e.g. hijacking, hostage-taking and terrorist bombing) spelled out in the annexed list of treaties to the United Nations
International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism
(the
Convention
).
"23. With respect to the stipulative definition of terrorism, Justice Lemieux held that the Supreme Court referred to Article 2 of the
Convention
which defined terrorism as 'any ... act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act.'
"24. Mr. Justice Lemieux then reviewed the jurisprudence of this Court and concluded that there must be an evidentiary foundation to support a finding that an organization was engaged in acts of terrorism. He noted that in
Sivakumar v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1994] 1 F.C. 433, (1993) 163 N.R. 197 (F.C.A.) this Court stressed the importance of providing findings of fact as to specific crimes against humanity which the refugee is alleged to have committed:
Fuentes
, above at paras. 74, 82.
"25. With specific reference to MQM-A and in setting aside a finding under subsection 34(1)(f) that there were reasonable grounds to believe that it is a terrorist organization, Madam Justice Anne L. Mactavish in
Ali v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [2005] 1 F.C.R. 485, 2004 FC 1174 held that the officer would have to have regard to the definition of 'terrorism' provided in Suresh as well as to the definitions of 'terrorist activity' and 'terrorist group' contained in section 83.01 of the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46: see also
Alemu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, (2004) 257 F.T.R. 52; 2004 FC 997."
