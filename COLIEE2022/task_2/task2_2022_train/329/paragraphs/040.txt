On the basis of the analysis of Mr. Justice Rothstein, then of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Poshteh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2005), 332 N.R. 374; 2005 FCA 121, and on the basis of the analysis of my colleagues in
Kanendra v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 546; 2005 FC 923 and
Jalil v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 138; 2006 FC 246 I accept that the decisions with respect to whether an organization is one described in paragraphs 34(1)(a), (b), or (c) of the
Act
, and whether one is a member of such an organization are reviewable on the standard of reasonableness simpliciter.
3. If the second decision is the one that is properly subject to judicial review, was Mr. Naaem denied fairness because he was not provided notice, or given any opportunity to respond to what is said to have been new evidence, or to make submissions on admissibility?
