The guidelines applicable to this exercise of discretion are found in the manual entitled "Evaluating Inadmissibility" (ENF 2/OP 18). Section 13 of ENF 2/OP 18 deals with ministerial relief. In section 13.6 the concept of national interest is explained as follows:
"Persons who have engaged in acts involving espionage, terrorism, human rights violations and subversion, and members of organizations engaged in such activities including organized crime, are inadmissible to Canada. The ground of inadmissibility may be overcome if the Minister of PSEP is satisfied that their entry into Canada is not contrary to the national interest.
"Whereas criminal rehabilitation is specific and results in a decision that the person is not likely to re-offend, the concept of national interest is much broader. The consideration of national interest involves the assessment and balancing of all factors pertaining to the applicant's entry into Canada against the stated objectives of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
as well as Canada's domestic and international interests and obligations."
