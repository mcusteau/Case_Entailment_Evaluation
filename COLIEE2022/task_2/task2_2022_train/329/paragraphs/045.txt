Justice Mosley went on to conclude that in the case before him, the officer had erred in the following respects:
"30. On the reasonableness standard of review, a determination that the organization to which the applicant belonged engaged or engages in terrorism must be 'supported by reasons that will withstand a somewhat probing examination' as described by Justice Iacobucci in
Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Competition Act) v. Southam
, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 748, (1996) 144 D.L.R.(4th) 1 at para. 56.
"31. The respondent may well be correct that the acts attributed to the MQM-A fall within the
Suresh
definition, or of the similar definition added to the
Criminal Code
by the
Anti-terrorism Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 41, but that is not apparent from a reading of the officer's notes or her decision letter. There is no indication as to what she means when she says that MQM-A is an organization that has engaged in 'terrorism' other than through a listing of acts described as terrorist activities. Thus it is impossible to determine how the officer defined 'terrorism' in assessing these acts. She has simply asserted that 'MQM is a known organization that has participated in terrorist activities' without explaining how she understood and applied those terms.
"32. A reader of the officer's decision letter and notes does not have a clear picture of what the officer understood 'terrorism' to mean and how that understanding was applied to the organization in question. The officer should have provided the definition she relied upon and explained how the listed acts met the definition. Her failure to do so means that her reasons do not stand up to a 'somewhat probing scrutiny'. Accordingly, the application will be granted and the matter remitted for reconsideration by a different officer."
