Returning to the prior jurisprudence of the Court, in
Ali v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2004 FC 1174, my colleague Madam Justice Mactavish rejected the Minister's argument that the decision of an immigration officer with respect to admissibility under subsection 34(1) of the
Act
, made prior to a decision with respect to ministerial relief, was not justiciable. She found that such a decision was not interlocutory in nature and that the availability of ministerial relief did not provide an adequate alternate remedy.
Ali
was recently followed on this point by my colleague Mr. Justice von Finckenstein in
Mohammed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1767; 304 F.T.R. 124; 2006 FC 1412.
