In the memorandum of March 7, 2005, the officer wrote as follows under the heading "Decision by Officer on Inadmissibility":
"Having interviewed Mr Naeem and reviewing the information on file it is clear that he was a self[-]admitted member of APMSO and MQM.
He has admitted that there was violence and in fighting MQM-A against MQM-H and the rangers on the Karachi campuses and elsewhere. He feels MQM was not a terrorist organization and was labelled so by the Government. This was in his opinion influenced by the propaganda in the media and press.
There is sufficient reliable information which I shared with the applicant to conclude the APMSO and MQM-A [were] involved in acts of terrorism during the time frame 1988-1999. We discussed information outlined in: Amnesty International - Library-Pakistan [footnote omitted].
AI concluded on page 23 'In Karachi, the two factions of the MQM, the factions of the Jeay Sindh and different religious groupings are pitted against each other and several of them oppose the Government. These confused lines of conflict have enabled each group as also the Government to hold others responsible for abuses. However, AI believes that the available evidence strongly suggests that [all] the armed opposition groups operating in Karachi are responsible for torture, abductions and killings.' [footnotes omitted]
These materials are all available to the public and [are] not classified.
These reports are from a reliable unbiased source. I have confidence in the validity of the source and have concluded the MQM-A has indeed been involved in acts of terrorism, such as assault, kidnapping and revenge killings during the time frame 1988 until 1999 when Mr. Naeem was a member of both the student wing APMSO and MQM-A."
