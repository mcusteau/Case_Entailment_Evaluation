Prior to the first hearing in the first application, the Minister brought a motion for an order declaring that he was not required to disclose the redacted portions of the certified tribunal record for reasons of national security. The parties agreed that section 87 of the
Act
, which permits an application to a judge for the non-disclosure of information, was not applicable because the information at issue was neither protected under subsection 86(1) of the
Act
, nor considered under sections 11, 112 or 115 of the
Act
. These are the circumstances where section 87 of the
Act
is expressed to have application. Section 87 is contained in Schedule A to these reasons.
