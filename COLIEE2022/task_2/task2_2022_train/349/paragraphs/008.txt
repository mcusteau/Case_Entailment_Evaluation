On September 27, 1993 the applicant's solicitor was informed that the respondent would not reopen or reconsider the applicant's case. The reasons for the refusal were set out as follows:
"... he [the applicant] was assessed as an electronic engineering technician, notwithstanding his educational qualifications in electronic engineering, which were not in doubt. However, during the course of the interview, it was determined that your client does not possess appropriate employment experience as an electronic engineer, and was assessed accordingly. To have an assessment of his educational qualifications would serve no useful purpose as he is not a practicing electronic engineer. Furthermore, I would also add that he does not have sufficient financial resources to support his initial establishment in Canada, as he indicated in his interview that his flat was valued at $8000 USD in April and he would be required to have $13000 CAD to support a family of three upon their arrival in Canada."
There is some disagreement between the parties as to when this reply was actually sent and/or received. Exhibit "D" of the affidavit of Carol Turner indicates that the letter was sent on September 27, 1993 and again on November 11, 1993. By contrast the applicant contends that the notification was not transmitted until December 19, 1993.
