On May 18, 1993 the applicant received notification of the visa officer's final decision to refuse his application for permanent residence in Canada:
"You were assessed based on the requirements for electronic engineering technician as, despite your electronic engineering diploma, your actual experience is that of a technician, maintaining electronic measuring equipment.
"You have attained insufficient units of assessment to qualify for immigration to Canada. You, therefore, come within the class of persons described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the
Immigration Act
and your application has been refused.
"Section 11(2) of the
Immigration Regulations
does not permit issuance of an immigrant visa to applicants, in the class in which you have applied, who have received zero units of assessment for the factor of occupational demand. Unfortunately, the occupational demand for which you are prepared to follow in Canada is currently zero. You therefore come within the inadmissible class of persons described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the
Immigration Act
."
