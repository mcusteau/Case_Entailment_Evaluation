As I see it, in this case, there are two bases warranting the court's intervention: first, a breach, in the particular circumstances of this case, of the duty of fairness by not holding an interview before the refusal was made and this for two reasons: extrinsic evidence was garnered by the visa officer which led her to conclude that the application was not bona fides without putting that issue to the applicant for comment; also, there was a breach of the Ministerial Guidelines. Second, in the circumstances, the decision was unreasonable.
