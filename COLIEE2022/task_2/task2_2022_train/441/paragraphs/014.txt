Justice Teitelbaum, in
Ali (M)
, supra, carved out an exception to the general proposition which he expressed. He said this at paragraphs 20 and 21 of his reasons for judgment:
"[20] On the other hand, the prime example of when a visa officer should inform the applicant of his concerns is when the visa officer has obtained extrinsic evidence. In that situation, the applicant should have the opportunity to disabuse the officer of any concerns that may arise from that evidence.
"[21] In essence, where an interview is necessary to assess an applicant, the duty of fairness requires that the visa officer thoroughly interview the applicant on factors relevant to the claim and give the applicant an opportunity to respond to allegations or assumptions of which the applicant could not be reasonably aware."
