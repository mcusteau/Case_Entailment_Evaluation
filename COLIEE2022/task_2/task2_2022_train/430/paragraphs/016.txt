I am satisfied that the converse is equally appropriate. In circumstances where the seller itself thinks the product "meets specifications", at least in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I do not think that this court should conclude otherwise. I find no evidence to the contrary on the record before me. It is true that the evidence indicates that Novopharm itself did at least two analyses on samples of the bulk enalapril maleate received by it from Delmar. The first of those analyses, conducted shortly after Novopharm took delivery, might serve to indicate that the bulk enalapril maleate was not at that time up to standards satisfactory to the Health Protection Branch. Whether that be true or not, there certainly was no evidence before me that Novopharm refused to accept delivery of the bulk enalapril maleate or in any way indicated that Delmar had failed to fulfil the conditions of Novopharm's purchase order.
