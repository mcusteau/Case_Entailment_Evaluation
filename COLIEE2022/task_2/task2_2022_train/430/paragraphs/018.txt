That the right to use and to sell to others includes the rights to reformulate the bulk enalapril maleate obtained by Novopharm from Delmar is beyond question. In
Eli Lilly & Co. et al. v. Novopharm Ltd. et al.
and
Eli Lilly Canada Inc. and the Minister of National Health and Welfare
[see footnote 6], Mr. Justice Iacobucci, for the court, wrote:
"The better view, as I have stated, is that the right to reformulate is premised on the inherant right of an owner of property to deal with that property as he or she sees fit. In the absence of some express term in the compulsory licence, prohibiting purchasers of bulk Nizatidine from Novopharm from reformulating it into final-dosage form, the weight of the caselaw supports the view that Apotex, having validly acquired the bulk medicine, would be free to reformulate it for resale without fear of infringing any right under Eli Lilly's Patents."
While there is no compulsory licence here at issue, certainly there was no evidence before me that Novopharm, as a purchaser of bulk enalapril maleate from Delmar was in any way prohibited from reformulating that bulk enalapril maleate into final-dosage form.
