Counsel for Merck urged that, if I were to reach the conclusion that I have, a prohibition should nonetheless issue prohibiting the Minister from issuing a notice or notices under s. C.08.004 of the
Food and Drug Regulations
to Novopharm in connection with 5mg, 10mg and 20 mg tablets of the drug enalapril maleate, until after the expiration of the Patent, where such tablets are formulated other than from the 100 kilograms of bulk enalapril maleate delivered to Novopharm on the 1st of October, 1990. I cannot adopt this submission. There is no evidence whatsoever before me to indicate that Novopharm has applied to the Minister for a notice or notices in respect of tablets of the drug enalapril maleate formulated from other than the 100 kg of bulk enalapril maleate in question. I am satisfied that it would be quite inappropriate for this court to issue a speculative prohibition.
