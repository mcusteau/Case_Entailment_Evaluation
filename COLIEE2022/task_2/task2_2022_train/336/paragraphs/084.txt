There is, of course, the principle of statutory interpretation urged by the defendant that words of a statute be given a contemporary meaning consistent with s. 10 of the
Interpretation Act
, supra, that "the law shall be considered as always speaking". Thus, courts have interpreted the words of a statute to include technological innovations made after the enactment where that is not inconsistent with the ordinary meaning, in contemporary terms, of the words used (
British Columbia Telephone Co. v. Minister of National Revenue
(1992), 139 N.R. 211; 92 D.T.C. 6129, at p. 6132 (F.C.A.), per MacGuigan J.A.;
Apple Computer Inc. et al. v. Mackintosh Computers Ltd. et al. (No. 1)
(1986), 3 F.T.R. 118, at p. 140, per Reed, J. (T.D.)). Further, it is urged that use of the words "in respect of" in the exclusionary phrase in Article XIIIC, i.e., the phrase "but not inclusive of rents or royalties in respect of motion picture films" should be interpreted so that "motion picture films" be given a broad meaning, as it was suggested was done by Dickson, J., as he then was, in discussing the interpretation of the words "in respect of" for the Supreme Court of Canada in
Nowegijick v. Minister of National Revenue et al.
, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29; 46 N.R. 41; 83 D.T.C. 5041, at p. 5045; 144 D.L.R.(3d) 193. The latter suggestion does not directly assist; by giving the widest "connection between two related subject matters", in the words of Dickson, J., here "rents and royalties" and "motion picture films", one cannot ascertain the meaning to be ascribed to "motion picture films" in the context of this case.
