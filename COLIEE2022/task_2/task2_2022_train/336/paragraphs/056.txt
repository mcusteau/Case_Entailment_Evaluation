Here, as I have found, there was no payment by a Canadian resident to the plaintiff for use of the television product in Canada, payment was only made to B.V. While B.V. was a nonresident it was not taxable under s. 212(5) because such payments were exempt from tax under the tax convention between Canada and the Netherlands. The fact that B.V. had contractual obligations to the plaintiff under its licensing agreement, including the obligation to act as collection agent for the plaintiff in relation to the latter's share of television gross receipts as defined, did not, in my opinion, change the nature of the relationship between B.V. and Canadian exhibitors or create any legal relationship between those exhibitors and the plaintiff. The payments by Canadian exhibitors were to B.V., not to the plaintiff, and the description of B.V. as the plaintiff's collection agent does not change that. In my opinion, B.V. was the sole payee of amounts paid by Canadian exhibitors for television exhibition of licensed television product. B.V.'s responsibilities to the plaintiff under the 1976 agreement do not change that nor do they constitute the plaintiff as payee of funds paid for those exhibitions in Canada.
