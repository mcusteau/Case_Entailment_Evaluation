Much television product produced on film is simply not intended for and has no market in theatrical exhibition, for example, so-called sit-coms or game shows, or episodic productions to run in series. The choice of film or videotape as the medium for the product may depend upon a variety of factors, technical and artistic. Early videotape was limited by lack of mobility of the substantial equipment originally required, especially camera equipment, and by technical limitations on its use, particularly out of doors, where lighting and other natural conditions are not readily controlled. For a variety of reasons film, rather than videotape, has continued to be the major medium for television product after recorded programming began to replace live programming in television production in the late 1950's, especially for prime time viewing in the evening hours.
