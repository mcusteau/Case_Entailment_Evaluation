Finally, the defendant submits that aside from any agency relationship, a portion of payments by Canadian television licensees should be considered as paid or credited to the plaintiff, because the arrangements provided by the 1976 agreement simply provided for funds to funnel through B.V. to the plaintiff on the basis of accounting for receipts, maintained by B.V. Moreover, it is urged that Canadian exhibitors must have been aware that B.V. was not entirely independent and indeed was dependent upon Universal and the plaintiff for supply of the product licensed. Yet, there was no evidence offered about any understanding Canadian exhibitors may have had about relationships of MCA TV (Canada) (i.e. B.V.) and the plaintiff or Universal Films (Canada) (i.e. B.V.) and Universal. In the absence of any evidence I infer that Canadian exhibitors paying license fees to MCA TV (Canada) a division of B.V. under their agreements with B.V. would be ignorant of any financial or other arrangements between B.V. and the plaintiff. They would not know what share, if any, of license fees paid would ultimately be transferred by B.V. to the plaintiff. There was no basis upon which a Canadian exhibitor could determine what portion of license fees paid should be withheld as tax.
