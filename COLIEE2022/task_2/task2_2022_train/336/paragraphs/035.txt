The plaintiff urges the agreement is a licensing agreement, not an agreement creating an agency of any kind. The defendant urges that even apart from the use of the words "collection agent", by the various terms of the 1976 agreement B.V. was a general agent of the plaintiff with authority to act on its behalf as a collection agent. I am not persuaded that either perception is appropriate.
