That distinction is reflected within Universal's operations, where two quite separate divisions have responsibilities respectively for theatrical product and for television product, in all phases from pre-production to post-production stages, including distribution. It is reflected as well in distinct professional guilds of those involved in either theatrical or television production and in distinct awards for excellence, the "Oscars" for theatrical works and the "Emmys" for television works. Production costs are significantly higher for theatrical product, which is, for the most part, drama. Even "made for television movies" so-called, perhaps the nearest parallel to theatrical product, have significantly lower budgets, and are produced in tight time constraints with different market conditions which affect the nature of their production. Principal market conditions are the requirements for television product to meet tight time limits for exhibition, both the total exhibition time and the requirement for cut-aways for advertising at regular periodic intervals. The latter requires that television drama, if it is to retain an audience, must build to minor climax points at intervals of perhaps ten minutes, with story line, action and music all developed with that in mind.
