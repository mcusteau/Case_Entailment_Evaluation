Against this background the evolution of the Canadian television industry may be seen from the evidence of Mr. Keeble. While some limited concepts of television emerged in the late 1930's, it was only after the establishment of the industry in the United States in the 1940's, that the first Canadian television broadcasting services, under auspices of the CBC, then the principal national radio broadcasting and regulating agency, were begun in Montreal and later in Toronto in the fall of 1952. Commercial broadcasting commenced by others only in the 1960's. Much of the early programming was live, carried any distance by microwave which was only developing as a communications device and did not then link the whole country. It relied for programming on live productions and on those films, B movies and short films, which could be obtained to fill off-peak hours. Through the 1950's and early 1960's films constituted only about 50% of programs, the rest were live. Feature films originally made for theatrical exhibition only became available in the 1960's. Only from the mid 1970's were so-called made for T.V. movies available, though film had come to be the main medium for much television product of the sit-com variety, the episodic series of mini-dramas, and even of game shows. By the late 1970's satellite transmission began to play an increasing role in the delivery of television programming.
