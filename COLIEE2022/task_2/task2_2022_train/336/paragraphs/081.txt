It is true that the
Report of the Royal Commission on National Development in the Arts, Letters and Sciences
(1951) (the Report of the Massey Commission) dealt briefly (at pp. 301-305) with television on the eve of its introduction in Canada, and anticipated extensive use of films in television programmes. That report estimated some 25% of all broadcasting time in the United States was then occupied by use of films and it anticipated even greater use of film, particularly in any Canadian television market. Nevertheless, that Commission declined to make specific recommendations on the matter. In my view, it is unlikely that it could have anticipated how significant film would ultimately become as a medium for use in television. In the years here in question Mr. Slusser indicated that film was the medium for 70-80% of recorded television productions.
