B.V.'s operations in Canada for the years in question were governed by the agreement dated January 1, 1976, between it and the plaintiff and Universal. The perception of the plaintiff is that these operations were carried on by B.V. on its own account. Thus any liability for tax was governed by the
Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Agreement (1957)
, and the payments received by B.V. from Canadian exhibitors of television product supplied under sublicensing agreements with B.V. were exempt from tax in accord with article IX, of that agreement. The agreement of 1976 between B.V. and the plaintiff and Universal was said to be a licensing agreement for distribution of television product and theatrical product and not an agency agreement. That perception is not shared by the defendant, who contends that B.V. was, at least in relation to a share of royalties paid for use of television product, a collection agent of the plaintiff, or was the agent of the plaintiff in a broader context. On this perception the defendant says the plaintiff was liable for tax under s. 212(5) of the
Act
, subject to the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention, 1942, as amended.
