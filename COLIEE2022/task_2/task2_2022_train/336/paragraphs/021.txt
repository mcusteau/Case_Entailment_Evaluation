Resolution of the differences in perceptions of B.V.'s operations requires examination of the 1976 agreement, a limited review of preexisting arrangements, and consideration of B.V.'s operations after 1976 in the years 1978 to 1981. Before undertaking that review, I note that for the plaintiff it was argued that the reassessments by the Minister in 1987, resulting in reductions of the taxes assessed, were apparently related to the Minister's reliance on the description of B.V. in the 1976 agreement as "collection agent" of the plaintiff in relation to a share of payments received for television product licensed for use in Canada, which term provided the basis for the taxes as reassessed. That term was not included in the agreement in relation to payments received for theatrical product licensed for use in Canada, and this, the plaintiff believes, provided the basis for a substantial portion of the reductions in the amounts of tax originally assessed. That was not accepted or agreed to by counsel for the defendant. As I have earlier noted, however, by the defence filed in these actions it is admitted that the reductions in taxes claimed by the reassessments were the result in part of the elimination of taxes on amounts received by B.V., and remitted to Universal, for theatrical product licensed for use in Canada. Thus, while there is no agreement on the specific reasons for the Minister's different treatment of payments received by B.V. for use of television product and payments received by B.V. for use of theatrical product, that difference is admitted.
