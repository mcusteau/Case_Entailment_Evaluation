Friedberg v. Minister of National Revenue
(1991), 135 N.R. 61; 92 D.T.C. 6031, at p. 6032 (F.C.A.), Mr. Justice Linden, speaking for the Court of Appeal, in dealing with the nature of a transaction, in light of the construction of documents and the testimony of the intent of the parties concerning it, said in part:
"In tax law, form matters. A mere subjective intention, ... is not by itself sufficient to alter the characterization of a transaction for tax purposes. If a taxpayer arranges his affairs in certain formal ways, enormous tax advantages can be obtained, even though the main reason for these arrangements may be to save tax* ... If a taxpayer fails to take the correct formal steps, however, tax may have to be paid. If this were not so, Revenue Canada and the courts would be engaged in endless exercises to determine the true intentions behind certain transactions. Taxpayers and the Crown would seek to restructure dealings after the fact so as to take advantage of the tax law or to make taxpayers pay tax that they might otherwise not have to pay. While evidence of intention may be used by the courts on occasion to clarify dealings, it is rarely determinative. In sum, evidence of subjective intention cannot be used to 'correct' documents which clearly point in a particular direction." (* citation omitted)
