I turn to consider the interpretation of s. 212(5), the taxing section in issue in this case. Counsel for the parties discussed its interpretation primarily in regard to the relationship between the parties created by licensing agreements and B.V.'s operations. For the plaintiff, discussion centred on the relationship between B.V. and the plaintiff and the relations between each of them and Canadian exhibitors under sublicensing agreements with B.V. For the defendant, discussion centred on the relationship between B.V. and the plaintiff. In my view, the words of the
Act
require review directly. For convenience, I repeat s. 212(5).
"212(5) Every nonresident person shall pay an income tax of 25% on every amount that a person resident in Canada pays or credits, or is deemed by Part I to pay or credit, to him as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of, payment for a right in or to the use of
(a) a motion picture film, or
(b) a film, videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television (other than solely in connection with and as part of a news program produced in Canada),
that has been or is to be used or reproduced in Canada."
