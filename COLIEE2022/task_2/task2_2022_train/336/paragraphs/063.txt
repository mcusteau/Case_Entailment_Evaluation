That evidence was presented by Mr. Daniel Slusser, the General Manager of Universal City Studios in Los Angeles and by Mr. Gordon Keeble, long-time leading figure in radio and television broadcasting in Canada, former President and Chief Executive Officer of CTV, who was accepted as an expert witness, with expertise on the use of film in Canadian television and the history of the industry in Canada. From their evidence I conclude that television product is very different from theatrical product in several respects. From their evidence it is clear that those involved in the entertainment industry in the production of material for exhibition consider that "motion picture films" is a term used in relation to theatrical product, i.e., materials produced for theatrical exhibition, and it is not used in relation to television product. Mr. Keeble's statement as an expert witness expressed his opinion, in part, as follows:
"It is my opinion that in general usage the term 'motion picture films' means films produced to be shown cinematographically in theatres. Historically motion picture films have also been referred to as 'movies'. Such a film might subsequently be broadcast on television ... There is a clear distinction between a motion picture film and a television program. In my experience no one in the television industry would ever refer to television productions recorded on film as 'motion picture films'.
"Within the past 15 years a practice has developed of producing programs of a certain length and format, which have become known as 'made for t.v. movies'. Some of them are made on videotape. In my opinion, a 'made-for-t.v. movie' - regardless of the media used - is a television program and not a motion picture film."
