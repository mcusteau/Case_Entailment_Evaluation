All of the evidence presented supports the conclusion that, except for the early days of television in the 1950's when so-called B grade movies and cartoons were early products originally made for theatrical distribution and later made available for exhibition on television, by the late 1970's and the years here in issue television product was very different from theatrical product. Even in the case of theatrical product, feature films, made available for exhibition on television, whether on film or on videotape (categories 1 and 2 as classified by the parties) were a qualitatively different product when modified for television presentation. Yet I infer that it was substantially similar in theme and overall dramatic purpose to the theatrical product upon which modifications, depending upon the particular product, were made.
