For the most part B.V.'s sublicensing agreements with Canadian television networks and stations are standard form agreements, the terms of which are uniform, printed on the contract form, except where modified by special terms that may be inserted, and the terms that are particular for the product licensed. The agreements make no reference to the plaintiff or its relations to B.V. The latter is clearly the contracting party with whom the Canadian exhibitor deals, to whom the exhibitor's obligations are owed, and to whom the exhibitor looks for performance.
