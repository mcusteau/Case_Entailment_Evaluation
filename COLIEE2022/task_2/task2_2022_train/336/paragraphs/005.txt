The assessments by the Minister in 1984 for the years in question, addressed jointly to Universal City Studios Inc. and to the plaintiff, each included the notation:
"15% nonresident tax payable under the
Income Tax Act
. MCA International B.V. Canadian Branch has failed to deduct and remit a tax of $[a specified amount] on $[a specified amount] paid or credited to you, a nonresident of Canada."
That notation does not specify that the tax assessed related to royalties paid in relation to the exhibition of theatrical product and of television product, but following the separate notices of objection filed by each of Universal and Limited the notices of reassessment for each year, again addressed jointly to the two corporations, resulted in reduced assessments for tax, plus interest claimed, for each year. The plaintiff understands, and this is admitted by the defence filed in each action, that the reduction in the tax assessed resulted from
a) the elimination of tax on the amounts remitted by B.V. to Universal, and
b) the elimination of tax pursuant to Article XIIIC of the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention, 1942, as amended on amounts remitted by B.V. to the plaintiff in respect of royalties for use of videotapes other than videotapes of motion picture films.
Thus the tax imposed by the reassessments in 1987 related to amounts remitted by B.V. to the plaintiff in respect of television product consisting of motion picture films, videotapes of motion picture films, television films and trailers.
