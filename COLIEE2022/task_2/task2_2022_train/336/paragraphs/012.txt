In the alternative, the plaintiff claims that if a share of the royalty payments by Canadian exhibitors to B.V. was subject to tax under s. 212(5), it was exempt from tax under article XIIIC of the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention. As the text of that article, earlier quoted, provides, royalties of the general sort here paid are exempt from tax on nonresidents, except for royalties in respect of "motion picture films". The plaintiff urges that the television product, for which the tax on royalties is here claimed, is not within the meaning of "motion picture films" within that article. The Minister's assumption, as we have seen, is that a substantial portion of the television product, that comprised of material produced on film or on videotape from motion picture films, constitutes "motion picture film" within article XIIIC, and thus is not included in the general exemption of royalties from tax provided by that article.
