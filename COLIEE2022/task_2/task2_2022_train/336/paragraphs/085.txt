There is, moreover, the principle in interpretation of treaties, enunciated by Estey, J., in
Melford Developments Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue
(1982), 44 N.R. 62; 82 D.T.C. 6281 (S.C.C.), that international treaties, in that case a tax treaty with Germany, are to be interpreted in accord with the meaning of the words at the time the agreement was adopted. Neither party to a treaty is free to unilaterally amend the treaty provisions as its domestic needs might dictate, unless of course the treaty itself recognizes such a course of action. In that case, as in this, the legislation enacting the treaty specifically underlined that principle [see footnote 4.]. Here s. 3 of the
Canada-United States of America Tax Convention Act, 1942
, as enacted by Parliament S.C. 1943, c. 21, provides:
"3. In the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of this Act or of the said Convention and Protocol and the operation of any other law, the provisions of this Act and of the Convention and Protocol shall, to the extent of such inconsistency, prevail."
