Insofar as the relationship of the parties depends upon the terms of their written agreement, in my opinion, aside from the particular relationship as collection agent in relation to funds received in excess of its share of television gross receipts, B.V. was not an agent in any sense of the plaintiff. Rather, in all other aspects of its operations B.V. operated on its own account. That conclusion is consistent with the arrangements agreed upon by the parties under clause 14, which I find defines the parties' relationship, not merely in regard to B.V.'s role as a collection agent, but in all other respects as well, subject to specific terms of the agreement itself. The defendant argues that many of those terms are consistent with a general agency relationship between B.V. and the plaintiff, but in my view, they are just as consistent with a licensing relationship for distribution of television product which is expressly not intended to create a general agency relationship.
