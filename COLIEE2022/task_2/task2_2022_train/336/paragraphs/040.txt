The field order for television product exhibition in Canada results in preparation in Amsterdam of a sublicensing agreement between "MCA Canada, A Division of MCA International B.V." and a Canadian network or television station. Copies of this are forwarded to the Canadian branch for signature by the Canadian contracting exhibitor, then returned to Amsterdam where the agreement is signed on behalf of B.V. and then returned through MCA TV (Canada) to the Canadian exhibitor, so that all contracts are concluded in Holland and subject to Dutch law.
