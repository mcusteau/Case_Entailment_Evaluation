The only evidence offered at trial, aside from the documents entered by agreement, was provided by witnesses for the plaintiff. Their evidence emphasized the independence from the plaintiff, particularly of the Canadian branch, of B.V. in its operations. The defendant's primary argument concerning an agency relationship between B.V. and the plaintiff was based on the 1976 agreement but, as indicated, I find no agency relationship except for the express term of the agreement describing B.V. as a collection agent for Limited in regard to certain receipts in excess of B.V.'s share. The defendant also submits that many of B.V.'s operations, under the agreement and as described by witnesses for the plaintiff, were consistent with an agency relationship. In my view, those operations were more indicative of independence of B.V. in its Canadian operations.
