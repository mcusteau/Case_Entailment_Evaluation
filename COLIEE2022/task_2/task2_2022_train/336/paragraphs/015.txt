MCA Inc., the parent company, has numerous other subsidiary corporations. Among them is Universal City Studios Inc. ("Universal"), another Delaware corporation, wholly owned by MCA Inc., which carries on business in the United States producing feature motion picture films, short films, trailers, television films and videotapes and related activities. Its product includes films intended, at least initially, for "theatrical exhibition", that is, for exhibition in theatres, and it also produces, by a separate internal division, film and videotapes intended for exhibition by television broadcasters. The former is recognized in the industry as theatrical product, and the latter as television product. Universal itself distributes its theatrical product throughout the United States, but its television product is distributed throughout the world, under a licensing agreement, by the plaintiff. Limited, the plaintiff, does distribute the television product in the United States.
