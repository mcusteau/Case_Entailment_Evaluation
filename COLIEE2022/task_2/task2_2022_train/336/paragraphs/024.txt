The agreement sets out in part B the terms for foreign theatrical distribution by B.V. It refers to a 1970 agreement between Universal and B.V. under which B.V. had the rights to distribute theatrical product throughout the world, excluding the United States and Canada, which rights B.V. had in turn granted by agreement to C.I.C. That earlier agreement is then extended, to a term ending with 1986, and to all "foreign areas", defined as the entire world excluding the United States and Puerto Rico. Thus by the 1976 agreement B.V. acquired the rights to distribution of theatrical product in Canada. B.V. was entitled to retain 50% of "Theatrical Gross Receipts" as defined in the agreement. Under clause B.2.(a), for funds received from C.I.C. in excess of those to which B.V. was entitled, B.V. is described as receiving them "as a collection agent" for Universal, but that description is not applied to any funds received by B.V. from its distribution of theatrical product in Canada.
