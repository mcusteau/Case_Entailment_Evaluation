I am not persuaded that, aside from its role as collection agent for the plaintiff in relation to a share of gross television receipts, B.V. was an agent for the plaintiff. In my opinion, the 1976 agreement and B.V.'s operations in Canada point to the independence from the plaintiff of B.V. in all of its operations in Canada, with the exception of its role as collection agent for Limited in relation to the latter's share of "gross television receipts", as defined in the agreement. In my opinion B.V. was not a general agent of the plaintiff under the agreement, or in the manner of its operations. It carried on its operations on its own account. It had a responsibility to account to the plaintiff and to pay funds to it, but that is not in itself evidence of an agency relationship.
