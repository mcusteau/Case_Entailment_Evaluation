Mactavish, J.
: Myung Soon Lee seeks judicial review of the negative decision of a PRRA officer. At the conclusion of the hearing, I advised the parties that the application for judicial review would be allowed, as I was satisfied that the decision under review had been arrived at in a procedurally unfair manner, and that it was not clear that the outcome of the case would inevitably have been the same, but for the breach of procedural fairness. These are my reasons for coming to that conclusion.
