Although the plaintiffs' counsel could well have proceeded ex parte with this application he, perhaps sportingly or superabundantly fairly, gave notice of it to the defendant's solicitors who instructed counsel to appear. Seeking to have this hearing adjourned, counsel for the defendant, the alleged contemnor, posited that such giving of notice converted this proceeding into a motion on notice which afforded him the opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiffs' supporting deponents on their respective affidavits, and to file affidavits in opposition to the application. Counsel for the defendant could cite no authority for that proposition. It is not valid. By according the defendant's counsel an opportunity to present adverse arguments, to which there is no entitlement, the plaintiffs' counsel did not thereby alter the nature of the proceeding. In according that gratuitous advantage to the defendant, the plaintiffs are not to be disadvantaged in bringing this summary application which would ordinarily have been an ex parte proceeding. Accordingly, the hearing proceeded in Ottawa on February 9, 1989.
