Now, a prima facie case of a willful and contumacious contempt of the court's injunction here would have required Mr. McDermid in his carefully crafted and sometimes needlessly prejudicial affidavit to negative the possibility of Brathwaites having itself ordered the shipment in question on or earlier than January 12, 1989, which shipment was, according to Mr. McDermid already shipped and en route to Brathwaites even as he and Mr. Phaneuf first spoke by telephone on January 13, 1989. That is a negation which Mr. McDermid either carefully or negligently did not express, even if his affidavit had been drawn for him by the plaintiffs' solicitors.
