The affidavit of Dhananjay Patel, a pharmacist, does nothing to support a prima facie case for the plaintiffs. On the contrary, it supports the defendant's solicitor's statement that "no atenolol was shipped between the 12th and 24th of January" and it does nothing to disprove that such atenolol "shipped since January 24th was from Canadian sources". It is clear that, of the drugs which the deponent Patel ordered from Apotex, only the apoatenol was reserved and shipped later, by about a week, the exhibited invoice being dated January 24, 1989. This deponent swears that apo-atenol is the brand name used by Apotex Inc. for its atenolol product.
