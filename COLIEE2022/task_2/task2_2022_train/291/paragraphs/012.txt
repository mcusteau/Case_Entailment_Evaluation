The plaintiffs' "hard case" herein includes certain information to which Keltie Sim swore in her filed affidavit of February 6, 1989. Paragraph 5 of her said affidavit, which invokes some hearsay, runs as follows:
"5. I have compared the lot numbers for the atenolol listed in Exhibit 1 to the Pearen affidavit (Apotex invoice No. 434184 dated August 4, 1988) with the atenolol lot numbers in Exhibit A to the McDermid affidavit (Apotex invoice No. 015940 dated January 12, 1989). Lot numbers Q4681 and Q4691 appear on both invoices. I have been advised by Mr. Brian Laskin, Marketing Manager for I.C.I. Pharma, and verily believe that Apotex brand of atenolol with identical lot numbers must contain atenolol from the identical source since the lot number identifies a specific production line run of compounded atenolol tablets. In view of the Exhibit A order and the aforesaid invoices the Apotex atenolol with lot numbers Q4681 and Q4691 must logically contain imported atenolol."
This deponent's comparison of the lot numbers, at least, appears to be absolutely accurate. It is Gordon McDermid's affidavit which would be needed to provide the necessary complement, but which by both what he solemnly affirms and by what he does not so affirm, is deficient in providing the necessary complementary information to complete a prima facie case.
