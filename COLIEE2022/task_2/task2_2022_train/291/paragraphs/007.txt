Most of the evidence so produced in support of the plaintiffs' application raises speculation, innuendo and entirely misses the mark. For example, if the Health Protection Branch has some requirement under the Food and Drugs Act and Regulations or other legislation that the defendant obtain a new or renewed notice of compliance, if at all, then it ought to enforce the legislation which it administers. The HPB has not purported to do so here. The plaintiffs' raising of such considerations in this proceeding is simply prejudicial and irrelevant. It has nothing to do with the compliance with, or alleged breach of, the injunction issued by Mr. Justice Rouleau.
