The injunction does not command the destruction of the defendant's commerce in atenolol. The defendant was entitled to pursue its otherwise and previously legitimate business, so long as it complies with the injunction's clear simple terms. The plaintiffs' evidence shows no willful and contumacious conduct on the defendant's part. It demonstrates, if anything, the defendant's care in complying with the injunction. In so doing, it cannot be regarded as interfering with the orderly administration of justice or impairing the order and dignity of the court, as was found by the Supreme Court of Canada in Baxter v. Cutter (1983), 50 N.R. 1; 75 C.P.R.(2d) 1. The court finds nothing of that sort in this case. Here, the evidence shows clearly that the alleged violations of the injunction by Messrs. Phaneuf and Weingarten - their words, indeed, which did not generate contumacious deeds - were so unimportant or took place in such circumstances that it is absolutely certain that neither they nor the defendant deserve to be punished, as Pratte, J., wrote in The Queen v. Perry above cited.
