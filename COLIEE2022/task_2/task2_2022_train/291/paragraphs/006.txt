The affidavit evidence with exhibits which the plaintiffs' counsel has presented in support of this application does not contradict that which the defendant's solicitor stated in the above recited letters. Nor does it raise a prima facie case, or produce reasonable and probable grounds upon which the court would embark upon "show cause" proceedings against the defendant.
