In the case of The Queen v. Perry, [1982] 2 F.C. 519, in the Appeal Division's unanimous judgment, written by Mr. Justice Pratte, two passages are of singular significance here. They are, first at p. 525:
"... If the evidence established a prima facie breach of the injunction, the judge had to issue the show cause order sought unless the evidence showed clearly that the violation of the injunction was so unimportant or had taken place in such circumstances that it be absolutely certain that it did not deserve to be punished."
The second selected passage by Pratte, J., is at p. 526, thus:
"... The affidavit evidence filed in support of the application shows clearly that at least some of the persons mentioned in Schedule A to the notice of motion, on the advice of the executive of their association, engaged in a strike by limiting their output. This, they did advisedly, after having been warned that their proposed course of conduct would constitute a violation of the injunction. In those circumstances, I do not see how their conduct can be said to constitute a mere technical breach of the injunction."
