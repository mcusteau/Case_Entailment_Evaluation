  In its decision, the IRB identified many inconsistencies and implausibilities in the applicant's story, leading it to determine that the applicant's well-founded fear of persecution was not credible. The IRB determined that the applicant had not been fired from his position as ambassador because of his membership in the Fourlabas clan, but rather because the term had ended for his position. Many letters in the record supported this determination. Moreover, the IRB did not err in its characterization of the events of December 7, 2000, since the applicant himself confirmed during his testimony that it had not been a coup d'Ã©tat, but rather an "outburst of anger". Finally, it should be noted that the applicants lived in France for many years without ever making a refugee claim there. The applicants have not provided any reasonable explanation for this behaviour. The IRB could therefore reasonably hold this fact against the applicants.
