  In this case, the evidence clearly indicates that the Djibouti regime is engaged in the repression of human rights, the persecution and intimidation of the civilian population as well as in government corruption. The IRB found that the applicant was complicit in the Djibouti regime based on the confidential duties entrusted to him by the government at a time when the regime was engaged in activities characterized as crimes against humanity and activities against the purposes and principles of the United Nations. In effect, the applicant had been ambassador to Paris since 1997, occupying the highest office in the most important post outside Djibouti. Apart from this office, the applicant represented his country before the European Union and Mahgreb countries. He testified that he had knowledge of the crimes in which his government was engaged. The applicant who, because of his position in Paris, represented the party in power as well as the Djiboutian government, never tried to disengage himself from these crimes. The evidence indicates that since his recruitment by the MFAIC of Djibouti in 1988, the applicant has always demonstrated his ongoing, active and confident support to the regime. Under the circumstances, therefore, it is my opinion that the IRB assessed the situation reasonably well and that it correctly applied the exclusion clause against the applicant. Despite the skilful arguments of Mr. Bertrand, counsel for the applicants, the panel's finding regarding the applicant's exclusion must also be upheld.
