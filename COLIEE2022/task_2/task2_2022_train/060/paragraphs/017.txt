  According to subsection 55(4) of the Rules, an application to re-open a refugee claim must be allowed "if it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice". It is also clear from subsection 58(1) that a claim may be declared abandoned where the Board has not received the claimant's contact information and PIF within 28 days of the claimant receiving the form and where the Minister and claimant's counsel do not have the claimant's contact information.
