  The jurisprudence appears to be clear that the central consideration in regard to abandonment proceedings is whether the applicant's conduct amounts to an expression of his intention to diligently prosecute his claim ( 
 Ahamad v. Canada (M.C.I.) 
  (T.D.), [2000] 3 F.C. 109, [2000] F.C.J. no. 289, at para. 32). When presented with the application to have the claim re-opened, the Board was furnished for the first time with information explaining the applicant's failure to appear, and demonstrating that it was due solely to administrative errors on the part of his counsel. In rejecting the application to reopen his claim, the Board failed to consider evidence before it of the applicant's conduct demonstrating his intention to earnestly pursue his claim. I am satisfied that the Board erred in seeing only part of the picture and neglecting this central consideration ( 
 Albarracin v. Canada (M.C.I.) 
 , [2008] F.C.J. No. 1425, at para. 4).
