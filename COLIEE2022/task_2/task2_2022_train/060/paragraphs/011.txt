  In a letter dated September 29, 2008, the Board informed the applicant that his request to have his claim reopened had been rejected. In brief reasons, the Board wrote: 
 
 
 
 The claimant was well aware of his rights and obligations. In particular, the requirement to notify the Board of any change of address having completed the correct form in October of 2007. The claimant had counsel when he completed his form, who is experienced and knowledgeable about the rules and regulations of the rules and regulations of the Board. Counsel indicates that on two occasions, they have erred. First, is in not indicating that they were, in fact, counsel of record on the Personal Information Form, and the second occasion, when a notice of change of address was sent to counsel via email, which was apparently viewed as junk mail and never actioned. However, the claimant also erred in not informing the Board of his new address as he had done previously. 
 
 
 
 Ultimately, it is the claimant's responsibility for the actions counsel for which he retains [ 
 sic 
 ]. In this claim, the claimant was clearly aware that he had to notify the Board of his change of address in writing, and failed to do so. 
 
 
 
 Based on the material presented, the request for a reopening of his case is dismissed.
