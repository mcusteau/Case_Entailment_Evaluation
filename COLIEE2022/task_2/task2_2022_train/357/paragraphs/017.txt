Mr. Justice Gibson of this court in
Gill (B.S.) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 122 F.T.R. 251 (T.D.), at pages 255-56 stated:
"In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Patel
(1995), 90 F.T.R. 234 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Cullen stated:
'The issue is not whether there has been a valid adoption in accordance with the laws of India. Rather, the Appeal Division must decide whether the adoption, in accordance with the laws of India, is properly recognized under the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
.'
"With great respect, I believe that both questions are proper issues for determination. I read the words of Mr. Justice Hugessen as requiring an examination of both whether there has been a valid adoption in accordance with the laws of India, and, then if the answer to that question is positive, whether the adoption in accordance with the laws of India, has resulted in the creation of a parent and child relationship within the terms of the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
.
"In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Edrada
(1996), 108 F.T.R. 60 (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay concluded:
'In my view, the tribunal had a duty under then s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
, having found the foreign legal requirements for adoption were met, to determine whether the relationship of parent and child has been established between the adopting parent and the adoptee. The definition of "adopted" in s. 2(1) contemplates a two step process in which a determination must be made, first whether foreign adoption laws have been complied with, and second whether a relationship of parent and child is created.'
"I concur with the foregoing statement and with the concept of a 'two step process'."
This decision was upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Gill (B.S.) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1998), 229 N.R. 267 (F.C.A.).
