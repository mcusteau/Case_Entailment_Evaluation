As my finding above means that the application for judicial review cannot
succeed as the applicant cannot meet the first stage of the test required when applying subs. 2(1) of the
Immigration Regulations
, supra, to determine if the children have been adopted within the meaning of the Canadian law contained in the
Regulations
. In other words, the children were not adopted "in accordance with the laws of a province or of a country other than Canada . . .".
