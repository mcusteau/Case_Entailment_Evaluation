The constitutional validity of other sections of the
Income Tax Act
related to administrative enforcement mechanisms has also been considered by this court. In
McLeod v. Minister of National Revenue et al.
(1983), 146 D.L.R.(3d) 561 (F.C.T.D.), Dubé, J., determined that ss. 222, 223(2) and 158(1) of the
Income Tax Act
, 1970-71-72, c. 63 [see footnote 2], were not contrary to s. 8 of the
Charter
. In that case there was no allegation that the collection proceedings were not carried out according to the provisions set out in the
Act
. However, the applicant in effect sought a declaration that these provisions were contrary to s. 8 of the
Charter
. Dubé, J., commented (at p. 564):
"The applicant offers no jurisprudence to support such a sweeping demand. The crux of his argument, as I understand it, is that the common shares in his company ought not to be seized pending his appeal as 'at the present time I am not in a position to provide payment of the assessed amounts'. This is surely not evidence of a breach of the applicant's rights to be secure against seizure.
"As I pointed out at the hearing, the
Income Tax Act
is a rigorous document. Parliament has ruled that taxes be paid within 30 days from assessment, whether the taxpayer files an appeal or not. The obvious purpose of such an imposition is to prevent a massive wave of taxpayers' appeals launched for the sole purpose of delaying the payment of taxes."
