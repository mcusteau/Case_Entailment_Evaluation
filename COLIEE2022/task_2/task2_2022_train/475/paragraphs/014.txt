The applicant submits that if the evidence on the balance of probabilities leads to a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the collection would be jeopardized by a delay then the order should be allowed to stand. Relying on the decision of Joyal, J., in
Laframboise v. Canada
, [1986] 2 C.T.C. 274; 5 F.T.R. 161 (F.C.T.D.), the applicant submits that the nature of the assessment itself raises reasonable apprehension that the order is justified.
