The respondents state that although the notices or reassessment were dated June 15, 1989, they were not mailed until July 17, 1989 and they suggest that at least a genuine attempt to give notice of the reassessments was a condition precedent to the relief granted in the order. Furthermore, they suggest that material facts were not disclosed and that misleading evidence was presented at the ex parte hearing. They suggest that Mr. Hale's affidavits intimate that they were selling or encumbering their assets in breach of the conditions of bail. They state that there was no evidence that they had disposed of or attempted to dispose of assets subsequent to the dates of the notices and that there is no evidence that they were attempting to avoid their tax obligations. Rather, the respondents state that assets were dealt with in the ordinary course of utilization and they submit that the applicant has failed to show that the collection of moneys owing for taxes would be "jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof".
