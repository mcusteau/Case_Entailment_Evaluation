  Apotex seeks recovery of all fees and expenses for all experts, regardless of whether they appeared at trial. There is no question that fees for experts who appeared at trial should be recovered. In the Reasons, I observed that there was some duplication of expert testimony. Upon further review and reflection, I am satisfied that all of the experts provided assistance to the Court. However, I am not prepared to allow an award of costs for experts who did not appear at trial.
