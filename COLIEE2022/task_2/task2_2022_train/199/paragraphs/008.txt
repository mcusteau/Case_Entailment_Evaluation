  The general rule is that the successful party should have its costs. I recognize that Apotex was not successful in each and every argument it pursued. Specifically, Apotex did not persuade the Court of the merits of its arguments on sound prediction to make, double patenting, the Gillette defence, best mode or first inventorship. (These issues are fully described in the Reasons cited above.) There is no doubt that pursuit of these issues during the trial led to extra time and expense for all parties. Nevertheless, I would not characterize success as divided. The Plaintiffs commenced an action to validate its claims to the drug ramipril and to enjoin Apotex from making and selling ramipril; they lost. In my view, success ought not to be measured in terms of how many issues were argued and won or lost. Rather, success ought to be assessed on the basis of the overall finding of the Court. Absent an abuse of process, "a successful plaintiff should not be penalised simply because not all the points he has taken have found favour with the court" (Sunrise Co. Ltd. v. The "Lake Winnipeg" (1988), 96 N.R. 310, 28 F.T.R. 78 (F.C.A.) at para. 29, rev'd on a different point, [1991] 1 S.C.R.; Canada v. IPSCO , 2004 FC 1083, 259 F.T.R. 204, at para. 36).
