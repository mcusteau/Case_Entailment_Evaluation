  It is not reasonable to penalize parties for bringing arguments that are ultimately abandoned after hearing the evidence or that do not find favour with the Court. Obviously, there may be cases where an argument pursued is so specious as to constitute an abuse of process. That was definitely not the case in this trial with respect to the issues raised that responded directly to the claim of patent infringement. The award of costs will not be reduced in respect of the issues that were advanced at the trial, regardless of whether Apotex succeeded or not.
