  Having considered all of the submissions of the parties and the factors of Rule 400, I determine that costs of the action in favour of Apotex and against Sanofi and Schering should be awarded in accordance with the above findings and directions. As noted above, I would decrease the cost award by 10% to deal with costs related to the issues in paragraph 12 and by 10% to deal with the remedies phase of the trial. On the other hand, I believe that an increase of 20% in the award is justified in response to the settlement offers made by Apotex. As a result of these off-setting findings, there will be no further adjustment to the costs otherwise calculated.
