  On a related matter, Apotex objected to the receipt of an expurgated version of Novopharm's submissions on costs. I have reviewed the portions of Novopharm's submission that were redacted. I am satisfied that Apotex is not prejudiced by not seeing the complete submission of Novopharm. It is true that the trial proceeded on special terms related to confidential evidence; much evidence was marked "For counsel eyes only". However, I do not believe that there is a continuing need for those special arrangements or any need for Apotex to see Novopharm's entire submission, some of which contains details of settlement offers that may disclose a litigation strategy. While Novopharm and Apotex cooperated fully during the trial and respected the bounds of confidentiality, I cannot ignore the fact that the two companies are fierce competitors with each other. Accordingly, I believe that it is in the interests of justice to keep separate the issue of costs awards.
