  Sanofi argues that the January 7 offer to settle should not be taken into account because it could not be accepted by Sanofi. In its submissions to this Court, Sanofi offers up a number of explanations to justify its refusal of the offer; in particular, "Apotex must have known that term 1 [of the offer] could not be accepted by Sanofi . . .". Nevertheless, Sanofi does not appear to have provided any explanation directly to Apotex at the time or any counterproposal that did not include term 1. While the January 7 offer appears to have had little substance, the February 16 offer contained significant compromise. In my view, Sanofi's attitude to both written offers was dismissive and unhelpful. In particular, Apotex's written offer on February 16 contained some elements that could and should have been seriously considered by Sanofi. However, I also recognize that the offer of January 7 was vague. On balance, I find that an increase in the overall award of 20% would be fair and just in the circumstances.
