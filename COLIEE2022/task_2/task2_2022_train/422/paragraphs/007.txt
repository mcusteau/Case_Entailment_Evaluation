I must analyze the case in light of ss. 3 and 39 of the
Veteran's Review and Appeal Board Act
, [see footnote 3] which read as follows:
"s. 3 The provisions of this Act and of any other Act of Parliament or of any regulations made under this or any other Act of Parliament conferring or imposing jurisdiction, powers, duties or functions on the Board shall be liberally construed and interpreted to the end that the recognised obligation of the people and Government of Canada to those who have served their Country so well and to their dependants may be fulfilled.
"a. 39 In all proceedings under the Act, the Board shall:
(a) draw from all of the circumstances of the case and all the evidence presented to it every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant or the appellant;
(b) accept any uncontradicted evidence presented to it by the applicant or appellant that it considers to be credible in the circumstances;
(c) resolve in favour of the applicant or appellant any doubt, in the weighing of evidence, as to whether the applicant or appellant has established a case."
