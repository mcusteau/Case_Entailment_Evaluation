In determining whether the Board committed a jurisdictional error by relying on the Guidelines as opposed to relying on the medical opinion of Dr. Weir, I must bear in mind ss. 35(1) and (2) of the
Pension Act
which read as follows:
"35(1) Subject to s. 21, the amount of pensions for disabilities shall, except as provided in subs. (3), be determined in accordance with the assessment of the extent of the disability resulting from injury or disease or the aggravation thereof, as the case may be, of the applicant or pensioner.
"(2) The assessment of the extent of a disability shall be based on the instructions and a table of disabilities to be made by the Minister for the guidance of physicians and surgeons making medical examinations for pension purposes."
Thus the Guidelines are specifically authorized by legislation. This distinguishes the case before me from
Dale Corp. v. Rent Review Commission et al.
[see footnote 4], where the Guidelines relied on by the decision-maker were not authorized. The Board, in following the Guidelines on when a pension becomes payable, did not fetter its discretion and did not commit a reviewable error.
