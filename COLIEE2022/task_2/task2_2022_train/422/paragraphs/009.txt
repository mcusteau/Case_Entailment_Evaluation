The Board in its reconsideration decision stated
"While the audiograms of 1989, 1992, and the most recent dated 14 November 1996 reveals the existence of some decibel losses, none of which record a hearing loss disability as per the Minister's current Hearing Loss Guidelines."
The Board also addressed the new evidence of Dr. Weir as follows:
"Unfortunately the evidence tendered in support of this application does not constitute new and relevant evidence that would lead to a different decision than that dated 25 March 1996. While Dr. Weir states that Mr. Gavin has a noise-induced hearing loss related to his service in the RCMP, and more particularly, to his participation in the annual shoot and practices up until the 70's (without using any ear protection), this is not supported by the evidence on file. The applicant served in the RCMP until 1975 and at his last medical examination in 1973, his hearing was recorded as normal. The service records disclose no complaints nor injuries regarding hearing related problems. No hearing loss disability was demonstrated at the time of the applicant's release from RCMP in August 1975."
