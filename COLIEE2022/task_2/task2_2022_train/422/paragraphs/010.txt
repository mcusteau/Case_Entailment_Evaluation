In my view this case is similar to the one before Justice Muldoon in
Bleakney v. Canada (Minister of Veterans Affairs)
[see footnote 5], where he stated at paragraph 7,
"[t]he Veterans Appeal Board's statement that it had 'carefully weighed the evidence in light of the medical guidelines provided to assist in making a determination' is no indication of unlawfully or unduly fettering its discretion. Section 35(2) of the
Pension Act
specifically refers to 'the instructions and a table of disabilities ... for the guidance of physicians and surgeons' as a basis for estimating the extent of a disability. That is a statutory direction which lawfully directs the boards how to go about their work."
Even if the hearing loss in the applicant's case was caused by his service in the RCMP, it does not meet the level required to receive compensation.
