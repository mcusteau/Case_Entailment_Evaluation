Based on jurisdictional error, the decision of the adjudicator is set aside. The applicant and the respondent, however, each raised other arguments on which I will comment briefly. The applicant further argued that the adjudicator compounded his error by stating that the respondent should have been considered for jobs in his reorganized department. This error was based on the adjudicator's claim that there was a distinction between the words "terminated" and "laid-off." Counsel for the applicant directed me to a number of cases that clearly indicate that these two terms are synonymous. Furthermore, I agree with counsel for the applicant that AECL had no legal obligation to consider the respondent for other jobs within the organization, although he was, in fact, considered for some positions.
