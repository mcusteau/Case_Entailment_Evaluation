  Apotex argues that Prothonotary Tabib was not clearly wrong in deciding to reject the filing of Dr. Husain’s affidavit, and did not err in law in reaching her decision. The Respondent claims that reply evidence is not permitted in the ordinary course, and that it constitutes extraordinary relief that can only be obtained through leave of the Court. Apotex submits that a party wishing to file a supplemental affidavit must demonstrate that the material is necessary, that it was not available at an earlier date, that the evidence could not have been included in its initial affidavit, and that its inclusion will not delay the proceeding. It claims that the Court will not grant leave to file a supplemental affidavit where the subject matter of the affidavit has been or could have been included in the Applicant’s initial affidavit evidence. In support of this argument, Apotex relies on Wayzhushk Onigum Nation v. Kakeway (2000), 182 F.T.R. 100 at 101 (F.C.T.D.); Deigan v. Canada (A.G.) (1999), 165 F.T.R. 121 at 123 (F.C.T.D.); and Wright v. Mission Institution (1998), 159 F.T.R. 104 at 105-106 (F.C.T.D.). According to Apotex, Applicant needs to satisfy the three criteria of the Eli Lilly test once the above criteria have been met.
