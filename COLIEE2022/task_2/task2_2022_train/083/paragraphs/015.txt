  It is trite law that discretionary Orders of a Prothonotary cannot be disturbed by a motions judge unless: 
 
 
 
 a. the question(s) raised in the motion are vital to the final issue of the case; 
 
 
 
 b. the orders are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or a misapprehension of the facts (Aqua-Gem, above; Merck, above).
