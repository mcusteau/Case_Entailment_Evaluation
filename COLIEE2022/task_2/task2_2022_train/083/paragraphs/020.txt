  Pfizer also attempts to limit the reach of Atlantic Engraving by suggesting that it only applies to situations where cross-examination has already taken place. Although cross-examinations already occurred in Atlantic Engraving, the Federal Court of Appeal’s reasoning in paragraph 9 of its decision suggests that a party must put its best case forward at the first opportunity and must not be able to split its case. While this meant that in Atlantic Engraving a party had to demonstrate that the evidence it sought to adduce was not available prior to the cross-examination stage, in other cases, a party seeking to adduce evidence may need to show that its evidence was not available at some other earlier date (such as at the time of filing its first affidavit evidence), in order to satisfy the Court that it is not attempting to split its case or is otherwise failing to put its best case forward at the first opportunity. I do not read the Federal Court of Appeal’s reasoning as being limited to cases where cross-examination has already taken place. Rather, I extract from Atlantic Engraving the general concern that Rule 312 should not be used to allow a party to split its case or to delay putting its best case forward.
