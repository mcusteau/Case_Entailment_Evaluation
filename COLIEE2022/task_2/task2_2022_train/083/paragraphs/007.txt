  Pfizer argues that since the Prothonotary clearly erred in law, the Motions Judge should hear the matter de novo: Canada v. Aqua-Gem Investments Ltd., [1993] 2 F.C. 425 at 454 (C.A.) [“Aqua-Gem”] ; Merck &Co., Inc. v. Apotex, [2004] 2 F.C.R. 459 at para. 19, 2003 FCA 488 [“Merck”]. Since Apotex did not allege any prejudice at the hearing, Pfizer submits that the only two remaining issues are whether the proposed evidence is in the interests of justice and whether it would assist the Court.
