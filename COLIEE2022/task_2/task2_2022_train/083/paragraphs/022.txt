  I therefore agree with Justice Beaudry in Purdue, above, that there are four factors to consider before leave to file additional material can be granted pursuant to Rule 312: 
 
 
 
 [12] Rule 312 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106 gives the Court a discretionary power to allow parties to file supplementary evidence. In Mazhero v. Canada (Industrial Relations Board), 2002 FCA 295, [2002] F.C.J. No. 1112 (F.C.A.) (QL), Justice John M. Evans wrote that applications for judicial review were summary proceedings that should be determined without undue delay, and that the discretion of the Court to permit the filing of additional material should be exercised with great circumspection. 
 
 
 
 [13] In Atlantic Engraving Ltd. v. Lapointe Rosenstein, 2002 FCA 503, [2002] F.C.J. No 1782 (F.C.A.) (QL), Justice Marc Nadon stated that the Court may allow the filing of additional evidence if the following requirements are met: 
 
 
 
 a) the evidence to be adduced will serve the interests of justice; 
 
 
 
 b) the evidence will assist the Court; 
 
 
 
 c) the evidence will not cause substantial or serious prejudice to the other side; 
 
 
 
 d) the evidence was not available at an earlier date. [emphasis removed]
