 Teitelbaum, J. 
 : The present motion arises within an application for prohibition under the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations. Apotex Inc. (“Apotex”) served a Notice of Allegation (“NOA”) on June 3, 2005 alleging non-infringement of Canadian Patent No. 2,023,089, held by Pfizer Canada Inc.’s (“Pfizer”). Apotex also made arguments as to the patent’s invalidity. Pfizer initiated proceedings on July 18, 2005 seeking an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance (“NOC”) to Apotex in respect of its proposed Apo-Quinapril tablets. Pfizer filed evidence with the Court on November 24, 2005, including a Confidential Affidavit of Dr. Mansoor Husain. Apotex then served and filed its evidence on April 7, 2006, including a Confidential Affidavit of Dr. Gordon W. Moe.
