  Pfizer asserts that the Prothonotary’s decision is clearly wrong since the Prothonotary erroneously imported and applied a fourth component into the test for determining whether to grant leave to file reply evidence. The Federal Court appears to be somewhat divided on the question of whether there is a fourth “availability” component to the test for leave to file reply evidence. In the case of Abbott Laboratories, above, which Prothonotary Tabib attempts to distinguish in the reasons of her impugned Order, Justice Heneghan suggests that the test for leave to file reply evidence is made up of three factors, as identified by Eli Lilly, above. In contrast, Justice Beaudry recently held that when the four factors found in Atlantic Engraving are met, the Court may allow the filing of additional evidence: Purdue Pharma v. Novopharm [2006] F.C.J. No. 497, 2006 FC 385 at para. 13 [“Purdue”]. Prothonotary Tabib has similarly stated in the reasons for her Order presently under appeal that Atlantic Engraving adds a requirement to consider “availability” in addition to the traditional three part test articulated in Eli Lilly. In the recent decision in Pfizer Canada Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Health) 2006 FC 790, Justice Lemieux upheld a Prothonotary’s decision to grant an applicant leave to serve and file a reply affidavit, and referred to both Eli Lilly and Atlantic Engraving. However, Justice Lemieux decided to uphold a Prothonotary’s Order to grant leave to file reply evidence on the basis of the difference between reply affidavits and supplementary affidavits, and did not conclusively determine whether there are three or four parts to the test to grant leave to file reply evidence.
