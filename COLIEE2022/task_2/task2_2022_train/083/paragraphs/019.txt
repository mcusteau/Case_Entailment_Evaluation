  Pfizer suggests that the Federal Court of Appeal’s comments in paragraph 9 of Atlantic Engraving do not apply to PM(NOC) proceedings. There is nothing on the face of the Federal Court of Appeal’s decision suggesting that its reasons should not apply with equal force to the PM(NOC) proceedings. Although Atlantic Engraving was a trade-marks case, in my view the Federal Court of Appeal’s comments with respect to the rules governing the filing of additional affidavit apply to all motions brought under Rule 312.
