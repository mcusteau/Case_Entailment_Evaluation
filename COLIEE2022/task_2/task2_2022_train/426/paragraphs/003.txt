The Refugee Division determined that the principal applicant was not credible and concluded that the claimants did not have a well-founded subjective fear of persecution based on his ethnic identity. The credibility finding was based on questions about the authenticity of the principal applicant's birth certificate (which identified his mother's ethnicity as Jewish), his limited knowledge of the Jewish faith and significant omissions from his PIF. The panel also reviewed documentary evidence about Armenia and found that it did not corroborate the types of human rights abuses alleged by the applicants necessary to support a well-founded objective fear of persecution.
