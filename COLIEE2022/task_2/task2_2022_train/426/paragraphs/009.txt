Finally, the applicants have provided no basis for the questioning the panel's assessment of the documentary evidence on Armenia. They argue that the documents relied upon by the panel merely stated that Jews do not face persecution from the government and did not address persecution from nationalist groups. However, none of the documentary evidence speaks to the persecution of Jews by nationalist groups in Armenia either. Nor is there any indication that the Armenian government is unable or unwilling to protect Jewish citizens from persecution. The burden of proving the claim lies on the applicants and the lack of documentation corroborating their allegations bolsters the panel's finding that the claim was not well-founded on an objective basis.
