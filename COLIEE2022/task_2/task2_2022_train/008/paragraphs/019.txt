  Since the applicant claimed that she feared that as a woman she would be targeted for rape in Haiti, the Board is expected to have considered the evidence with respect to her membership in a particular social group, namely women in Haiti or more specifically, Haitian women returning to Haiti from abroad.

 Bastien v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2008] F.T.R. Uned. 691; 2008 FC 982. In  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321, at paragraph 70, the Supreme Court of Canada explicitly recognized that gender can provide the basis for a "social group".
