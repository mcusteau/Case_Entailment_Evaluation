  With respect to the applicant's claim of gender-based persecution, specifically "violence, kidnapping and rape", the Board pointed out that the applicant had never been "a victim of any attack related to her status as a woman". An absence of past personal persecution, the Board asserted, is a factor in assessing the claim. The Board then noted that the documentary evidence "as outlined by counsel does speak of violence against women being a problem in Haiti" as well as a general lack of recourses to combat crime. In addition, the Board found that Haiti has enacted laws against rape and there are organizations seeking "to promote the interest of women in Haiti".
