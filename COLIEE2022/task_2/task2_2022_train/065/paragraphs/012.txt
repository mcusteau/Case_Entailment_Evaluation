  For the reasons expressed by Evans, J.A., in  
 Hameed 
 , supra, even though the applicant is still short of one unit of assessment to qualify for permanent residence in Canada, I will use my discretion to set the visa officer's decision aside because it is possible that, if the applicant had been awarded the appropriate number of units of assessment under the education factor, the visa officer might have found an additional unit under the personal suitability factor or exercised a positive discretion.
