Justice Kelen allowed the application, finding that the country condition evidence demonstrated continuing tension between Afro- and Indo-Guyanese and the inability of the state authorities to protect the Indo-Guyanese due to an "acute lack of resources."

Since the evidence cited contradicted the Board's conclusions, failing to address the contradiction was a reviewable error.
