 [29] 
  The Board's conclusion is unreasonable because it approaches the issue of motive for the attacks as a yes or no question. The criminals targeting the applicants may have been motivated by a combination of the applicants' racial and economic status. That the motive is at least not  
 purely 
  economic is supported by the applicants' reference to racial slurs made against them during the incidents they allege. It is further supported by other evidence, namely the testimony given by the applicants. In  
 Katwaru v. Canada 
 , [2007] FCJ No 822 (FC), this Court left open the possibility that where at least one of the motives is based on a convention ground, nexus might be established. The Court there decided there was not enough evidence to establish race as a motive, and therefore declined to find mixed motives. However, the Court left open the possibility that nexus may be found where there is evidence to support both alleged motives. In this case there was  
 some 
  evidence before the Board as to the possibility of mixed motives and therefore the Board erred in failing to consider whether there were mixed motives and if so, whether the motives could constitute the convention nexus required.
