  In order for leaving school to be determinative, the Board must first find that the ill treatment the child faces at school is persecution. Justice McKeown states in  
 Ali 
 , at para. 4: "I do not agree with [the Board's] reasoning since it means if Hossay Ali is returned to Afghanistan, the only way she can avoid  
 being persecuted 
  is to refuse to go to school. [emphasis added]" In this case, the Board found that the ill treatment the children faced in school was discrimination, but not persecution. That finding was not unreasonable given the evidence before the Board.
