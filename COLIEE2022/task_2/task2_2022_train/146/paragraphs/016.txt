  Counsel submitted at the hearing that if the claimants were found not to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection, the Board should consider whether there were compelling reasons to let the claimants remain in Canada under s. 108(4) of the  
 Act 
 , based on the trauma from the 2006 home invasion. The Board denied this request on the basis that there needed to be a change in circumstances to trigger s. 108 of the  
 Act 
 , and that the Board was without jurisdiction to consider compelling reasons regarding incidents found to be the result of a generalized risk.
