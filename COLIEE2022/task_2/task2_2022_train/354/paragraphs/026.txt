By letter dated July 30, 1997, the applicant submitted arguments with respect to erroneous information relied upon (respondent's Application Record, Tab 3, Affidavit of David Young, Exhibit C, at p. 28). These arguments were considered by Mr. Young in the context of the applicant's second request for cancellation of interest. As stated in his affidavit, Mr. David Young, Officer with the Department of National Revenue, reviewed the applicant's letter dated July 23, 1997 and made the following recommendation to Mr. Beaulac:
"- Points #1, #2 & #4 - These comments all deal with taxation year prior to 1994. However, effective with the 1994 and subsequent taxation years, an individual may no longer create or increase a loss by claiming CCA on a Class 31 or Class 32 property. This information was stated in the 1989 and 1994 Rental Guides. Photocopies of the applicable pages should be sent to the client. Therefore, it is irrelevant if the rental property was a MURBS or not as starting in 1994, he could not increase his rental loss by claiming CCA on a Class 32 property which is what he did in 1994 and 1996. In 1995, his CCA schedule indicates Class #6. The fact that this information is stated in the 1989 Rental Guide indicates that it was available to the client for at least five years prior to 1994. This information was not provided to the client during the course of the audit and Fairness review.
"- The details surrounding the reassessment of October 22, 1996 indicates that the adjustment had nothing to do with the client's rental activity. Rather, an amount of 23,350 was deleted from line #130 (other income) as pension income of this amount had been erroneously included twice at both lines #115 and #130. Mr. BRACELAND's discussions concerning this matter were with a J.A. Proulx and not J.A. Delorme."
