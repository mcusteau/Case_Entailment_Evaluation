 [34] 
  In order to invoke the exception under 20(1)(c) it is well-recognized that the Applicant bears the burden of demonstrating, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a reasonable expectation of probable harm to the Applicant's competitive or financial position that would result from disclosure. See  
 Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. National Capital Commission 
  (1998), 147 F.T.R. 264 (T.D.), at para. 24. The evidence required to justify an exemption under this section must be detailed and convincing and must demonstrate a direct link between disclosure and the alleged harm. Speculation is not sufficient. The Applicant must demonstrate a reasonable expectation of harm.
