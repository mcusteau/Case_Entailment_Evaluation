  This is a facilitating provision. Sufficient detail is required to permit identification of a record and an adequate response to the Request. The wording of s. 6 contains no prohibition against disclosing documents that are not relevant to the Request. In fact, s. 6 does not even address the concept of relevancy. It merely stipulates that a request must be made in writing and must provide sufficient detail to allow the identification of the record requested. It would take a substantial amount of reading in to conclude that this imposes an obligation on the government institution to refrain from disclosing information that is not relevant to the Request. Bearing in mind the underlying objectives of Parliament in enacting the  
 Act 
 , as embodied in s. 2, I find there is no exemption available to the Applicant based upon relevancy. See  
 Rubin v. Canada (Minister of Transport) 
 , [1998] 2 F.C. 430; 221 N.R. 145 (F.C.A.), at para. 23;
