In this case, there is no doubt that the applicant committed a crime, as the authenticity of the U.S. judgment, dated August 24, 2000, handed down against the applicant, has not been disputed. On the expression "non-political crime", DÃ©cary, J.A., adds at paragraph 136:
"Article 1F(b) deals with ordinary crimes. ... Such crimes have not been defined by the international community acting collectively. ... As I have already mentioned, strictly speaking it can be said that crimes recognized in extradition treaties have been the subject of international consensus and constitute serious non-political crimes in the eyes of the international community; but such crimes are not international crimes in themselves and are defined in terms of the applicable domestic law. Although in practice it is assumed that such ordinary crimes, which are usually the subject of extradition treaties, generally constitute serious crimes, the other crimes will be the subject of debate and each time the question will arise as to whether an act is an ordinary crime, and if so whether it is a serious crime within the meaning of the
Convention
