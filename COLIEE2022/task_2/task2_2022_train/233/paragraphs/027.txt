Finally, the applicant submits that the reasons of the RPD are insufficient. The RPD's obligation to give reasons for its decisions dismissing a refugee claim is set out in s. 61(2) of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, SOR/2002-228. Generally speaking, to satisfy the obligation to give reasons for a decision, the reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise, appropriate and intelligible that a claimant can understand why the claim has failed and decide whether to seek leave to appeal and on what basis. More specifically, the Federal Court of Appeal applied this principle to the protection of refugees in
Mehterian v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] F.C.J. No. 545 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 2:
"Section 69.1(11) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, requires that the Refugee Division 'give written reasons' for any decision against the claimant. If this obligation is to be met, the reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible that the claimant may know why his claim has failed and decide whether to seek leave to appeal, where necessary."
The impugned decision, which is nine pages long, contains ample reasons and is sufficiently detailed. It refers to the relevant legislation and case law, and indicates how the decision was reached. The applicant's argument is therefore dismissed.
