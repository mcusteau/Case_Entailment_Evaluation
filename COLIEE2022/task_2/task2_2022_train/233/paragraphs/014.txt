The applicant adds that, on review of the record, his hesitation as to whether to request refugee status and his expressed agreement to return to Mexico are justified and comprehensible. On this point, the delay in requesting asylum can give rise to negative inferences (
Huerta v. Canada
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 271) since it is a means of gauging the claimant's subjective fear of persecution. However, this consideration alone is not decisive in impeaching a claimant's credibility. In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Koriagin
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 720; 2003 FC 1210; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1534, at paragraph 7, Mr. Justice Martineau writes:
"The subjective fear of the claimant must always be assessed. When the evidence shows that the claimant did not take advantage of the first opportunity to claim refugee status this could compromise his claim under certain circumstances. Although this consideration is not determinative in itself, it is relevant in assessing the claimant's credibility:
