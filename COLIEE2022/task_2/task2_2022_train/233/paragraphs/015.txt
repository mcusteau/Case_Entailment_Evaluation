In the case at bar, a number of facts combine to undermine the applicant's credibility (these facts are clearly noted in the RPD decision - see the Tribunal record, at pages 53 et seq. and in particular the notes of the immigration officer, which contain a number of admissions by the claimant concerning his fear and the reasons why he came to Canada: pages 53, 54, 56 and 57). The RPD decision did not reject the applicant's contentions solely because he delayed in requesting asylum. It relied on a number of observations drawn from the evidence in determining that the applicant's behaviour was not that of a person who fears to return to his country. In doing so, it did not err.
