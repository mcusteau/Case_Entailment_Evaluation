That the applicant's representations raise issues of the gravest import is beyond doubt in that matters of the liberty of the individual are the subject of both statutory and constitutional enactments. In the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix III, paragraph 1(a) proclaims
"(a) the right of the individual to ... life, liberty [and] security of the person ... and the right not to be deprived thereof except by due process of law;"
Similarly, the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms being Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982 (hereinafter the Charter) provides:
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
