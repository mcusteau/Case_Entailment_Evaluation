In the present case, the rights and obligations of the applicant are to be identified and determined on two bases. The first is the lawful sentence of imprisonment which was imposed upon him. It must be regarded as an apt sentence, since its term of seven years is the minimum term prescribed by Parliament for his offence, and it has not been modified on any appeal. The applicant's status of prison inmate does not, of course, dilute his right to life and security of the person, but it severely limits his right to liberty. His obligation is to keep the peace by submitting to his carceral bounds and to be of that special form of good behaviour exacted by the discipline of all lawful prison regulations and orders. The second basis of identifying and determining the applicant's rights and obligations is the Parole Act and regulations. By means of this legislation Parliament itself has prescribed the conditions under which the respondent is empowered to grant conditional liberation from prison during the very term of imprisonment imposed under the sentence pronounced by a court of competent jurisdiction.
