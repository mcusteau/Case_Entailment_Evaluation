There remains the issue as to whether the respondent's decision to deny day parole ought to be quashed on certiorari in order that the applicant may be heard in person upon his request for day parole before the board prior to its rendering of the decision on that request. Does "due process" or "the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice" exacted by the Bill of Rights, or "the principles of fundamental justice" proclaimed by the Charter, demand a so-called oral hearing by the respondent on this request for day parole? Questions of a highly similar nature were considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in Singh et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 117; 58 N.R. 1. There the subject matter was different, being the appellants' alleged rights to a hearing in the determination of their asserted refugee status pursuant to the Immigration Act, 1976. Although the Supreme Court came to a unanimous judgment in favour of the appellants, it divided equally in emphasizing the Charter on the one hand and the Bill of Rights on the other.
