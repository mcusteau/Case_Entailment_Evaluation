Now it is quite apparent that the applicant, an inmate at William Head prison institution at Metchosin, British Columbia, purposely invoked Rule 324 and followed its procedures, in order to place his written complaints before the court for adjudication. Equally, it is abundantly clear that the respondent has reciprocally replied in writing, and has not sought to invoke that portion of Rule 324(3) which permits it to apply for an "oral hearing", in the words of the rule. Since Rule 324 operates for the convenience of the Bar (if not also for the avoidance of expense for their client litigants), fairness demands that it operate for the convenience of prison inmates, too. Surely very special circumstances would be needed to deprive a prisoner of the convenient access to the court which is afforded by Rule 324, within whose contemplation there is always a judge available, no matter where the applicant may be imprisoned.
