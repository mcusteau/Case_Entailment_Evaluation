 DECISION 
 
 
 
 Considering the statements made by the applicant at his interview with the CSIS that he was a member of the Milices rodriguistes and later of the FPMR, that he admitted participating in sabotaging high voltage towers, that he had carried a weapon on a number of occasions while on surveillance and had taken commando training; 
 
 
 
 Considering that the applicant admitted to the CIC officer that he had been a member of those organizations, had made roadside bombs and used dynamite, engaged in sabotage, supported the FPMR's activities and operations, had a leadership role in the FPMR and had used armed struggle and violence, had incited the commission of these acts; 
 
 
 
 Considering that the documentary evidence notes that the actions of the MIR and the FPMR caused the deaths of civilians and militants, collateral damage that was denounced as serious violations of human rights in the Rettig Report [Report of the Chilean National Commission on Truth and Reconciliation] and whereas the role of the Milices rodriguistes was to support the FPMR's activities; 
 
 
 
 Considering the nature of these three organizations; 
 
 
 
 In light of the definition of terrorism in the Canadian Criminal Code; 
 
 
 
 After considering all the facts and the documents on file, I have reasonable grounds to believe that the claimant is described in section 34(1)(c) and 34(1)(f) of the  
 IRPA 
 . 
 
 
 
 Consequently, he is inadmissible to Canada.
