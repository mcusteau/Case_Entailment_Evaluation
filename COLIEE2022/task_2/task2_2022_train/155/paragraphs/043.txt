  Not only is it incumbent on applicants to argue that they did not have the mental capacity to understand the effects of their actions and to provide evidence of that, but there will also be a presumption that "the closer the minor is to 18 years of age, the greater will be the likelihood that the minor possesses the requisite knowledge or mental capacity" ( 
 Poshteh 
 , above, at para 51). These are precisely the principles that the officer applied in this case. After referring to  
 Poshteh 
 , she noted that the applicant, although he was a member of the Chilean Communist Party at the age of 14, became active in the Milices rodriguistes at 16 and participated in FPMR operations beginning at the age of 17. She also noted that he did not present any arguments for an exemption based on his age at the time of the incidents. In short, her decision is fully consistent with  
 Poshteh 
 , above. The onus was on the applicant, not the officer, to establish that he should be granted an exemption because of his age. Accordingly, the decision appears to me to be unassailable in this regard.
