  In her notes to file, the officer pointed out in particular that the  
 Global Terrorism Database 
  has identified 306 acts of terrorism in Chile either clearly attributed to the MIR between 1976 and 1994 or that this organization is suspected of committing, including acts of intimidation and targeted assassinations, bombings, acts of sabotage using explosives on electrical and transportation infrastructure, government buildings, businesses and industries, armed attacks, assassinations and hostage-taking in which the targets were members of government, security forces and journalists. As for the FPMR, the officer consulted the documentary evidence and noted that this group distinguished itself by a highly militarized structure and by its particularly violent terrorist tactics, that it was involved in urban guerrilla warfare and the use of explosives like the MIR and that 830 acts of sabotage, bombings, kidnappings and assassinations were claimed or attributed to this group between 1984 and 1997. Finally, the Milices rodriguistes served as a recruitment pool and support network for the FPMR militants and trained people to erect barricades, cause power outages and confront security forces when they wanted to enter working-class areas.
