  Accordingly, the officer could reasonably find, in light of the evidence on file, that there were reasonable grounds to believe that these groups were organizations that are engaging, have engaged or will engage in acts of terrorism. Again, the applicant did not really dispute this finding, except to state that one must take into account the fact that these organizations were fighting against a dictatorship that itself was extremely violent and repressive. The notion of terrorism (at least as it is understood and implemented in Canada) does not distinguish between "good" and "bad" terrorism and cannot be justified by the goal sought: see  
 Suleyman v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 
  2008 FC 780 at para 59-60 (available on CanLII) [ 
 Suleyman 
 ]. However, it may well be that the Minister can consider the context in which the acts of terrorism mentioned above were committed for the purposes of determining whether the applicant's presence in Canada would be detrimental to the national interest under subsection 34(2) of the  
 IRPA 
 . I will come back to this later.
