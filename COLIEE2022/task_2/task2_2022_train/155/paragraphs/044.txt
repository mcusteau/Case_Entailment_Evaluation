  The applicant alleges that the officer did not comply with the rules of procedural fairness because she did not give him the opportunity to comment on the decisions found on the Internet concerning the general situation in Chile at the relevant time and, specifically, the documents regarding the organizations that the applicant was a member of or had worked for. The applicant submits that he found out about these documents for the first time when the officer's decision was sent to him. These documents, about ten in number, are from non-governmental organizations, universities, the U.S. State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and a magazine (Jane's World Insurgency and Terrorism). Also in this list are three works published in 1988 and 1998.
