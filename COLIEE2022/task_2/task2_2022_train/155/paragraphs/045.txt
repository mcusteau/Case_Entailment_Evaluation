  I cannot agree with the applicant's argument, essentially for the reasons put forward by the respondent. First, the applicant was properly informed that his involvement in Chile with the FPMR, the MIR and the Milices rodriguistes was a concern because, on the one hand, he had had an interview with the CSIS in 2004 about his involvement in these organizations, and, on the other hand, had received a call-in letter specifically in this regard on March 6, 2012. Therefore, it is not surprising that the officer based her findings on documentary evidence from diverse, credible and trustworthy sources concerning the political and social situation in Chile during the relevant years as well as the organizations mentioned by the applicant himself in his application for permanent residence. In fact, these documents are directly related to the situation in Chile and the organizations that the applicant said he was a member of in his application for permanent residence, involvement that was the subject of an interview with the CSIS.
