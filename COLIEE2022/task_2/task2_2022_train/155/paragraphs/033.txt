  In short, I have no hesitation in finding that the officer's decision was reasonable, at least with respect to the applicant's participation in terrorist organizations. Perhaps the Court would not have arrived at the same conclusion, but that is not the issue. Considering the evidence before her, the officer could reasonably find that the FPMR, the milices rodriguistes and the MIR are organizations that engage, have engaged or will engage in acts of terrorism. Even if the officer erred in determining that the applicant personally carried out acts of terrorism, that error would be inconsequential insofar as the mere fact of being a member of a terrorist organization is sufficient to trigger inadmissibility on security grounds under subsection 34(1) of the  
 IRPA
