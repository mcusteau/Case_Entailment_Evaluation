  First, it should be noted that there is no blanket exemption for minors under section 34 of the  
 IRPA 
 , in contrast to what paragraph 36(3)( 
 e 
 ) states for inadmissibility on grounds of criminal activity. Accordingly, the fact that a person was a minor is a factor that can be considered in applying paragraph 34(1)( 
 f 
 ) but will not constitute in itself a ground for exemption. The onus will be on applicants to convince an officer that they did not have the maturity, responsibility or mental capacity required to appreciate the nature of their acts: 
 
 
 
 Having concluded that, although there is no blanket exemption for minors, an individual's status as a minor is still relevant under paragraph 34(1)( 
 f 
 ), the next question is what considerations are to be taken into account. 
 
 
 
 It seems to me that in the context of age, relevant considerations in paragraph 34(1)( 
 f 
 ) would be matters such as whether the minor has the requisite knowledge or mental capacity to understand the nature and effect of his actions. It is open to the minor to advance those considerations and whatever other arguments support an exemption from paragraph 34(1)( 
 f 
 ) on the basis of his status as a minor and to provide evidence in support of those arguments.
