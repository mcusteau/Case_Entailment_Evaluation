  This argument has no merit and cannot be accepted. It must be remembered at the outset that the officer's notes to the file (in this case, the document entitled [translation] "Determination of Admissibility") are part of the decision she issued, as the Supreme Court indicated in  
 Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para 44 (available on CanLII). A careful reading of these notes shows that the officer was well aware of the applicable standard of proof and referred to it explicitly in the first lines of her analysis after quoting sections 33 and 34 of the  
 IRPA 
 .
