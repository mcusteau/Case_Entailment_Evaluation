  Furthermore, there is no doubt, in my opinion, that the officer could reasonably find that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was described in paragraphs 34(1)( 
 c 
 ) and 34(1)( 
 f 
 ) of the  
 IRPA 
  for his activities in the Milices rodriguistes and the FPMR and his membership in the MRI from 1987 to 1991, and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that these organizations engage and have engaged in acts of terrorism. The applicant admitted this at his interview with the CSIS in 2004 and confirmed it to some extent at his interview with the officer in March 2012. In his application for permanent residence submitted in 2011, the applicant himself, in answering the question about organizations he was a member of, wrote the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front (which he described as a revolutionary organization). In his previous application submitted in 2003, he had also mentioned the Movement of the Revolutionary Left in response to the same question.
