  As regards the similarity in PIF narratives, I see that Justice Campbell in Bao v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 301 came to similar conclusions on a similar set of facts. I certainly agree with him that the erroneous credibility finding related to the similar PIFs was so central to the Decision as a whole that it would be extremely unsafe to allow this Decision to stand.
