  The Board's credibility findings should be evaluated on a standard of patent unreasonableness (Aguebor, above; Pissareva v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 2001 (QL) (T.D.); Umba v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2004] F.C.J. No. 17 (QL) (F.C.)). While the Board made a negative credibility finding, in my view it gave insufficient reasons to sustain its conclusions. While the patent unreasonableness standard requires a high level of deference to the Board, the Decision should nonetheless be quashed and the matter sent back for reconsideration.
