  I have no doubt that the use of a standard form of questions is problematic for several reasons. But for the purpose of this analysis, the most important factor is the obvious similarity between the questions and the format of each of the seven PIFs. Even if one were to believe that the translator was not using the list of questions for the Applicant's PIF, it is possible, and in my view highly probable, that the translator was using a template. This reasoning is a strong explanation as to why identical wording was used at some points in the PIFs. It also explains why the home of each Falun Gong practitioner where the raid occurred is mentioned in all cases, which was one consistent feature flagged by the Board as suspicious. The reason for this consistency is apparent when it is noticed that the translator's question #10 asks "At whose home were you practicing (sic)when the police came?"
