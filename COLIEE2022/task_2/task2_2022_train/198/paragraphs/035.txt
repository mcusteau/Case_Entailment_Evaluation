  These comments include Footnote 22, where the Board provides an example of a non-abstract, interesting lecture contained in Zhaun Falun. In my view, these comments cross the line of appropriate analysis by engaging in a highly relative and speculative treatment of what constitutes membership in a Falun Gong group. Some claimants may say that discussing Master Li's writings is a main benefit of group practise; however, it does not follow that this was the main benefit to joining Falun Gong for this Applicant. In fact, the Applicant explained that the major benefit to her was the relief from physical pain she had experienced since taking up the practise of Falun Gong. The Board's comments regarding the "interesting" reading to be found in Zhaun Falun, in my view, fail to consider the reasonableness of the Applicant's answer that, for her, the writings are generally complex and abstract.
