  The six other PIFs were disclosed to the Applicant prior to the hearing and she was invited to comment. She explained that fellow Falun Gong practitioners had similar experiences to her own, and that their Master, Li Hongzhi, instructed them to tell the truth.

The Board held that these answers "are indicative of a claimant who was capable of responding quickly and in an assertive manner" (Decision at page 4).
