  Since I am satisfied that the Officer applied the correct test to the question before her, that she did not ignore evidence and that, overall, the decision falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes (See Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 at para. 47; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa, 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339 at para. 59), the Court will not intervene in the decision.
