  The Officer does not stop at that point. The Officer explicitly considers the evidence put forward by the Applicant in support of a "spousal relationship", as follows: 
 
 
 
 As evidence of their relationship, the applicant and sponsor provided their marriage certificate; a government cheque stub sent to the applicant at their shared address; limited photos (of their engagement, wedding, and a party they attended for a child's birthday); cellular phone invoices for two phone numbers, both under the sponsor's name; and a letter from their landlord attesting to their cohabitation. The applicant and sponsor also provided character reference letters for the applicant; the sponsor's bank statements for the past three months; and various bills/statements addressed to the sponsor, sent to their address. As the sponsor was already living at that address, I gave little [weight] to these documents as evidence of their spousal relationship. The applicant and sponsor both stated that they do not have any joint assets. I have considered their submissions and find them insufficient as evidence of a couple who was involved in an intimate relationship.
