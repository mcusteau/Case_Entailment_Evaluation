  The Applicant argues that the Officer erred by failing to explain why some of the information was rejected or not given weight. In my view, the Officer provided sufficient explanation. In short, even if every piece of documentary evidence had been accepted, the Officer was not persuaded that it established that the couple was in a loving intimate relationship - in other words, a genuine marriage. A review of the evidence before the Officer shows that this conclusion was open to the Officer. For example, the letter from the landlord could have been written about two platonic roommates. The photos of the engagement may have been evidence that an "engagement" took place but say nothing about the genuineness of the relationship or marriage. The Officer considered and weighed all of the evidence.
