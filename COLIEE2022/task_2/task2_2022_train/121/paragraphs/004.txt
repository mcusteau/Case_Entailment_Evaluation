 [4] 
  As clarified during the oral submissions, this Application raises two issues: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the Officer err in concluding that the marriage was not genuine by failing to have regard to the documentary evidence submitted by the Applicant? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Officer err by failing to address whether the marriage had been entered into by the Applicant primarily for the purpose of acquiring permanent residence in Canada?
