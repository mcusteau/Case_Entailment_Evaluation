  What type of evidence could satisfy this burden? For one, a "genuine" marriage would weigh significantly in favour of a marriage that was not entered into for the purpose of gaining status in Canada. In this case (and, perhaps, in most situations), there is a strong link between the two prongs of the test. The timing of a marriage could also be relevant. For example, if the Applicant had been married while he still had legal status (a valid work permit or otherwise), this would be significant evidence in his favour. That was not the case before the Officer.
