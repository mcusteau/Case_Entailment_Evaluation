  As noted above, s. 4 of the Regulations requires the Officer to consider whether the marriage was entered into for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA. The Applicant bears the burden of demonstrating that his marriage was not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring permanent resident status in Canada. I recognize that it is difficult for an Applicant to prove a negative; however, this is the evidentiary burden that must be met by the Applicant.
