It is true that the defendant Bio-Lawn Ltd. altered its tradename to add, in much smaller lettering, the words "care Services Inc.", so as to get Bio-Lawncare Services Inc., leaving the mark BIO-LAWN clearly visible. Nevertheless, I feel that this change is insufficient to avoid the latter creating confusion with the plaintiff's registered mark BIO-LAWN. I also consider that the distinction in the logo used by the defendant ("o" replaced by a globe) is not sufficient to distinguish the two marks, chiefly on account of the fact that the two marks are phonetically identical and in the ideas it suggests.
