In view of the fact that the Court has before it an ongoing and deliberate infringement of the plaintiff's right in the mark BIO-LAWN, the issuing of an injunction would seem to be indicated in the circumstances. At the same time, there is no evidence of damages or loss of profits in the record. Additionally, the plaintiff did not establish to the Court's satisfaction that customers ceased doing business with it because of the confusion of the trademarks or tradenames or that this led to any loss of market share. Further, considering the tests laid down by the courts (in particular
Vorvis v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1085; 94 N.R. 321; 58 D.L.R.(4th) 193, at para. 27), this is not a case in which the imposition of punitive damages appears to be necessary. On the other hand, considering all the factors indicated in Rule 400, including the defendants' conduct before and after the service of the pleadings and the exhibits in the record, the Court is inclined to award costs to the plaintiff on a solicitor-client basis. The allocation of a general amount seems proper in the circumstances. Consequently, in the exercise of its discretion, and having reviewed the exhibits in the record, the Court sets and awards to the plaintiff the sum of $6,000 as costs, which will be payable by the defendants in addition to Court costs and other assessable disbursements.
Motion granted.
