Moreover, in my view, the circumstances here are such that I have no hesitation in drawing a clear inference that Parliament intended, as in the normal course, that changes in the
Act
, would be applicable to cases arising for determination after the amendment in question became effective. In S.C. 1988, c. 35, under which s. 46.01 was originally enacted to provide "access criteria", limiting refugee claimants entitled to have their claims considered by the Refugee Division, s. 41 of that amending statute designates certain classes of persons, who as refugee claimants were to be entitled to have their claims determined by the Division notwithstanding any provision of the
Act
as amended. Clearly anyone not exempt under s. 41 was subject to the access criteria established by s. 46.01, by necessary implication. As for the later amendment, amending s. 46.01(1)(e)(ii) and enacting s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B), by S.C. 1992, c. 49, that amending
Act
specifically provides intransitional provisions as follows:
"109. Subject to sections 110 to 120, every provision of the Immigration Act, as enacted by this Act shall on the coming into force of that provision, apply in respect of every application, proceeding or matter under that Act or the regulations made thereunder that is pending or in progress immediately before the coming into force of that provision."
Sections 110 to 120 which provide for exceptions to that general rule of application, relate to inquiries or hearings commenced before the coming into force of the amendment but not then determined, or outstanding departure notices, or applications for leave or appeals. In my opinion, s. 109 expressly enunciates Parliament's intent that amendments enacted in 1992, including s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B), are to be applied in any inquiry initiated thereafter, as was the inquiry by the adjudicator in January 1994, the Minister's review of Mr. McAllister's case from February to May 1994 (raised in IMM-3223-94) and the senior immigration officer's finding in June 1994 (raised in IMM-4348-94).
