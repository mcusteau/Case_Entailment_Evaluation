The second application, in court file IMM-4348-94, initiated on direction by the court in response to the plaintiff's application to amend the original application, concerns the decision of a senior immigration officer, made under s. 45(1)(a), dated June 27, 1994, that the applicant is not eligible under s. 46.01(1)(e)(ii) of the
Act
to have his claim to be a Convention refugee referred to the Convention Refugee Determination Division. That decision was said to be based on the determination of an adjudicator that he was a person described in s. 19(1)(f) and the Minister was of the opinion it would be contrary to the public interest to have the applicant's claim determined under the
Act
.
