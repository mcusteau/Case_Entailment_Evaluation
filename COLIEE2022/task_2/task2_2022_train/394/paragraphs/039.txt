With reference to the term "public interest", it is urged that the court should note and follow the comments of Chief Justice Lamer in
R. v. Morales (M.)
, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 711, at p. 732; 144 N.R. 176, at p. 194, addendum 147 N.R. 335; 51 Q.A.C. 161; 77 C.C.C.(3d) 91, at p. 104.
"As currently defined by the courts, the term 'public interest' is incapable of framing the legal debate in any meaningful manner or structuring discretion in any way.
"Nor would it be possible in my view to give the term 'public interest' a constant or settled meaning. The term gives the courts unrestricted latitude to define any circumstances as sufficient to justify pretrial detention. The term creates no criteria to define these circumstances. No amount of judicial interpretation of the term 'public interest' would be capable of rendering it a provision which gives any guidance for legal debate."
