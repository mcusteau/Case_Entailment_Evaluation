In my opinion, Mr. McAllister, having made a claim to be a Convention refugee had no vested or entrenched rights to have that claim considered under the rules prevailing at the time of his application; rather, he only had a right to have his claim considered under the rules prevailing when it is considered. He was a person with no right to enter or remain in Canada, except as provided by the
Immigration Act
, and in my opinion any claim he made to enter or to remain is subject to the law prevailing when that claim is determined, not when the claim is made.
