The principles of fundamental justice, under s. 7 of the
Charter
, and the right to a fair hearing in accordance with those principles, under s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, do not require an oral hearing in all circumstances; rather the requirements vary with the circumstances, but the key factor is the adequacy of the opportunity for the person affected to state his or her case and to know the case that has to be met. (

Singh
, referring to requirements under s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, Beetz, J., commented that "most important factors in determining the procedural content of fundamental justice in a given case are the nature of the legal rights at issue and the severity of the consequences to the individuals concerned". In that case he found the rights at issue, i.e., the rights of refugee claimants to seek refuge in Canada, subject to the provisions of the
Immigration Act, 1976
, as it then was, were of such vital importance for those concerned, who claimed threats to their lives or liberty, i.e., persecution, in their home country, that assessing their claims to be refugees required at least one oral hearing before a final negative determination. (
Singh
, supra, per Beetz, J., at pp. 229-231 of S.C.R.; pp. 434-435 of D.L.R.) In the same case, Wilson, J., noted another factor of significance, that is that hearings based on written submissions would not be satisfactory where a serious issue of credibility is involved, for fundamental justice requires that credibility be determined on the basis of an oral hearing.
