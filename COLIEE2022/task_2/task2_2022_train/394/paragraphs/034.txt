There are other differences in this case. Here the basis for decision is membership in an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe is or was engaged in "terrorism", a ground here not challenged by the applicant, except to urge that membership in an organization, any organization, is not unlawful in Canada. However that may be, it is to be noted that the
Immigration Act
by s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) does not make membership in an organization unlawful in Canada. It does preclude admission to Canada of those who are found to be members of an organization that on reasonable grounds is found to have been or is engaged in terrorism. It applies in the case of foreign nationals, who have no right to enter or remain in Canada except as the
Act
permits. It is unlike
Al Yamani
where the provision in question applies to one who has been admitted as a permanent resident who has a right to remain in the country, subject to termination in accord with the law.
