In an era when much attention on the international level, and within many countries, has been and continues to be given to containing, restricting and punishing acts of terrorism, I am not persuaded that the word can be considered so vague as to be devoid of sufficient certainty of meaning, or that application of the provision would present uncertainty. The word is recognizable to individuals, as it apparently was to Mr. McAllister in this case, and to those concerned with applying the
Act
. In my opinion "terrorism" as used in s.Â 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) does not render that provision vague in the sense that it violates s. 7, or in the sense that it would be contrary to s. 1, of the
Charter
, or in the sense that the applicant did not understand the meaning of the term in the circumstances of this case.
