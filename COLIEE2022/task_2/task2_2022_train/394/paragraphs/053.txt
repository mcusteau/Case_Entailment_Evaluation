I am not persuaded these principles are here applicable. I do not accept that either ss.Â 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) or 46.01(1)(e)(ii) is in any means applied retrospectively in the circumstances of this case. Rather, the legislation in force at the time the decisions were made was given effect. (Per Rouleau, J., in
Cortez v. Canada (Secretary of State)
(1994), 74 F.T.R. 9; 23 Imm. L.R.(2d) 270 (T.D.).) It is not retrospective legislation to adopt a rule that henceforth excludes persons from Canada on the basis of their conduct in the past. (Per Hugessen, J.A., in
Rudolph v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 2 F.C. 653, at p. 657; 142 N.R. 62, at p. 65; 91 D.L.R.(4th) 686, at p. 688 (F.C.A.).)
