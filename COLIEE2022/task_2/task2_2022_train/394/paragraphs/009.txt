[9]
On the same day, July 9, 1993, an immigration officer made a report pursuant to s. 27 of the
Act
alleging that the applicant was a person in Canada other than a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident who there are reasonable grounds to believe has been convicted outside Canada of an offence that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence punishable under an Act of Parliament by a maximum term of imprisonment up to ten years or more. Persons falling in that class, defined by s. 19(1)(c.1)(i) of the
Act
are inadmissible to Canada. That report was said to be based on information that the applicant was convicted in Northern Ireland of the offence of conspiring to commit murder, an offence which if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence contrary to s. 465(1)(a) of the
Criminal Code
. Also on July 9, 1993 a direction was issued pursuant to s. 27(3) of the
Act
for an inquiry to determine if the applicant was a person described in the immigration officer's report of that same day, i.e., a person described in ss. 27(2)(a) and 19(1)(c.1)(i) of the
Act
.
