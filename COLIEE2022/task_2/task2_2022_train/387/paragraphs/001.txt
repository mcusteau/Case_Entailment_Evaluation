Reed, J.
: The plaintiff and the defendant Hallmark Cards, Incorporated ("Hallmark") appeal a decision by the Associate Senior Prothonotary of October 2, 1996. That decision ordered the answering of certain questions, on discovery, by the representative of the defendant, and declined to order the answering of others. The defendant argues that the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in ordering the answering of some of those questions. The plaintiff argues that the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in not ordering the answering of others. The questions will be addressed by category of question, as counsel classified them.
