I do not interpret the role of a judge on an appeal of a prothonotary's order in that way. Whatever may be the difference, if any, between the Chief Justice's description on p. 454 of
Canada v. Aqua-Gem
, supra, and that of the majority of the court at p. 463, the latter governs. It clearly contemplates that the judge will
exercise his or her discretion de novo
, on the material that was before the prothonotary, and not engage in a hearing de novo based on new materials.
