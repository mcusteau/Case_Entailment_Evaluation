The plaintiff appeals the decision that refused to order the answering of most of the questions that involve other products. The defendant appeals the decision that ordered that three be answered. It is argued that the three fall into the same category as those for which answers were not required. I would summarize the three questions, and the answers given, as follows:
"Q. 2140 Were the 9" and 11" versions of the 'Happy Birthday Old/Buzzard'plates sold to Coutts and sold by Coutts in Canada?
A. look at the invoices.
Q. 2141 were invoices produced of sales of Country side and Deep Dish Plates to Coutts?
A. possibly but not purposefully.
Q. 2142 was there a practice that when Coutts purchased 7" dessert plates with a particular design it also purchased 9" and 11" plates with the same design and maybe also napkins, streamers, balloons etc.
A. the best source of the data is in the invoices, which the plaintiffs have been given; the plaintiff can ask Coutts; Hallmark refuses to answer."
