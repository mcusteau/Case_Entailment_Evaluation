The defendant argues that the Associate Senior Prothonotary failed to include within this category two questions that should have been so included because they require hypothetical or speculative answers. The defendant argues that these two questions should not have been ordered answered. The plaintiff contests that assertion. The two questions are:
"Q. 3324 Would Hallmark have needed to outsource the supply of Sturdy II plates to Deco and Gulf States if they had not supplied plates to Coutts in that period of time?
Q. 3326 In the costs that you have indicated for us are to be found in that list of documents you gave at the start later (sic) this afternoon, would any of those costs have been incurred even if Hallmark has not supplied Coutts with the Sturdy II plates in the period 1988 to the present?"
