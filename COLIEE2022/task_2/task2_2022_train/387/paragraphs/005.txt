Counsel raised the question, at least with respect to category 7, on p. 14 infra, whether the decisions of the Associate Senior Prothonotary could be said to be discretionary ones. If they are not, the logical consequence would be that a judge should apply a more stringent test when reviewing the orders on appeal. It is difficult to characterize a prothonotary's authority to require that a person, being examined for discovery, reattend to answer questions as discretionary, if that term is being used only to signify a situation in which there is room for reasonable people to hold differing opinions as to the appropriate decision. The prothonotary's authority to require that certain questions be answered on discovery is not of that nature.
