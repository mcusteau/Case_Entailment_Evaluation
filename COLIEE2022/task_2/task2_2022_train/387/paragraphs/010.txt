I would not characterize the allegation of inducement as set out in the plaintiff's statement of claim as a conclusion of law. It is a conclusion of fact or an allegation of factual inference. I have not been persuaded that the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision to require that answers be given to this category of question was wrong in principle or based on a misapprehension of the facts. The Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision must be assessed in the light of Federal Court Rule 458(1), [see footnote 8] and the decisions describing the scope of discovery applicable in this court; see, for example,
Reading & Bates Construction Co. v. Baker Energy Resources Co., Baker Marine Co. and Gaz Inter-Cité Québec Inc.
(1988), 25 F.T.R. 226; 24 C.P.R.(3d) 66; 22 C.I.P.R. 240 (T.D.);
Armstrong Cork Canada Ltd. et al. v. Domco Industries Ltd. et al.
(1983), 48 N.R. 157; 71 C.P.R.(2d) 5 (F.C.A.);
Invacare Corp. v. Everest & Jennings Canadian Ltd.
, [1984] 1 F.C. 856; 55 N.R. 73; 79 C.P.R.(2d) 138 (F.C.A.).
