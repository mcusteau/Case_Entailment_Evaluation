Counsel for the defendant indicates that when he responded to the plaintiff's demand for particulars, he tracked the wording of the patent so that the pleading basically says that whatever the patent means this was part of the prior art, a matter of common general knowledge. The defendant has given the plaintiff all the prior art documents of which it is aware and takes the position that further evidence respecting the state of the prior art or common general knowledge is a matter for expert opinion evidence at trial. The decisions in
Jackmorr Manufacturing Ltd. v. Waterloo Metal Stampings Ltd.
(1985), 8 C.P.R.(3d) 271 (F.C.T.D. Protho.) and
Cabot Corp. v. 318602 Ontario Ltd.
(1986), 12 C.P.R.(3d) 462 (F.C.T.D. Protho.) are cited. In these decisions it was held that insofar as answers to questions concerning common general knowledge are based on the opinion of experts, they did not have to be answered on discovery. Insofar as such was not so based, they were required to be answered. I cannot conclude that the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision, declining to require that the questions be answered, was clearly wrong, as based on either a wrong principle of law or a misapprehension as to the facts.
