A useful explanation of the use of the label discretion, however, is found in the text R.P. Kerans,
Standards of Review Employed by Appellate Courts
(1994) at pp. 122-149. Discretion is described as a term that is used for two categories of decisions: (1) those involving the management of the trial and the pretrial process; and (2) those where the rule of law is one that makes many factors relevant and requires a decision-maker to weigh and balance them. In both cases "the inclination of the reviewing courts has always been to govern with a light hand. They do this by assigning the issue to the 'discretion' category" [see footnote 6]. The text notes that courts use this terminology to describe most interlocutory matters including, for example, the amendment of pleadings, the striking of pleadings and "a host of other situations where the judge manages or supervises ... the process of preparation for trial" [see footnote 7]. It is in this sense that I understand the

case to be using the term discretionary when speaking of decision-making by a prothonotary.
