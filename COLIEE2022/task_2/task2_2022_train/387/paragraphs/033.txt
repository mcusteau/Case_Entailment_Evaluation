Counsel for the defendant notes that an appeal from an order of a prothonotary is required by the
Federal Court Rules
to be commenced by an "application" (rule 336(5)), and that an application to the court is to be made by a motion (rule 319(1)). A motion is commenced by a notice of motion, not a notice of appeal, and is to be supported by an affidavit setting out "
all the facts on which the motion is based that do not appear from the record
" (rule 319(2)). Despite this seeming ambiguity in the
Federal Court Rules
, I understand the procedure established thereby to be, as noted above, an appeal based on the material that was before the prothonotary. This is consistent with the decisions in
Woods Canada Ltd. v. Harvey Woods Inc.
(November 30, 1994), [1994] F.C.J. No. 1795 (T.D.), and
Symbol Yachts Ltd. et al. v. Pearson
, [1996] 2 F.C. 391; 107 F.T.R. 295 (T.D.). In some circumstances new evidence may of course be entertained, see Federal Court Rule 1102 and the jurisprudence thereunder. Such circumstances do not, however, exist in the present case.
