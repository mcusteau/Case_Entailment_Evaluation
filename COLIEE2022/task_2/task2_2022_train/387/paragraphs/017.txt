The plates that are alleged to infringe are sometimes sold packaged together with cups and napkins all carrying a similar design (Party Packs). Other products such as balloons and paper streamers may also be sold carrying these designs. One such design is an image of Winnie the Pooh. Another is described as the "Happy Birthday Old Buzzard" design. The questions in issue ask for: information concerning the products other than plates; the marketing strategy with respect to selling those products; the practice of the defendant of selling the products packaged together with the plates. The Associate Senior Prothonotary found that most of these questions need not be answered. He did, however, order the answering of three.
