The hearing of the refugee application was held on May 9th, 1997. At that time the "exit/re-entry" visas had expired. The mother applicant says that at that time she had destroyed her Iranian passport and her French "carte de resident". As a result she says she does not have the right to return to France, a right that attaches to the possession of the nationality of France and as such the Article 1(E) exclusion does not apply to her.
