The evidence as to the right of the applicants to return to France was obtained from the C.I.R.B. Documentation Information and Research Branch. The relevant portions follows:
"... There is a temporary and a full 'carte de resident' for foreign nationals in France. The temporary card is valid for one year; the full card for 10 years, the carte de resident may be renewed by the Prefecture, who is part of the Ministry of the Interior.
"... The only obligation is to avoid breaking the law, as resident status could be jeopardized by an illegality. ...
"A full card holder who wishes to leave France needs an 'exit/reentry visa'. These visas permit travel outside France for a period of 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year, and can be renewed. If the holder is out of France for more than 3 consecutive years, then the holder must reapply for a carte de resident.

"During a telephone interview with the DIRB, an official of the Embassy of France in Ottawa stated that French consulates or embassies abroad do not have the mandate to renew exit/re-entry visas (Visa d'aller et retour) (3 Feb. 1995). The official stated that exit/re-entry visas are issued by the local pr√©fectures on behalf of the Ministry of Interior."
