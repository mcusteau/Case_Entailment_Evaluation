Nevertheless, the facts of this case do support the granting of a Mareva injunction, insofar as the defendants should be enjoined from removing from the jurisdiction of this court or otherwise disposing of, encumbering, releasing or dispossessing themselves of any of their assets, including the Zodiacs. In the English Court of Appeal decision in
Third Chandris Shipping Corp. et al. v. Unimarine S.A.
, [1979] 3 All E.R. 409, Lord Denning set out the factors which applicants for a Mareva injunction must satisfy at pp. 985-5:
"(i) The plaintiff should make full and frank disclosure of all matters in his knowledge which are material for the judge to know ... (ii) The plaintiff should give particulars of his claim against the defendant, stating the ground of his claim and the amount thereof, and fairly stating the points made against it by the defendant. (iii) The plaintiff should give some grounds for believing that the defendants have assets [in the jurisdiction]. (iv) The plaintiff should give some grounds for believing that there is a risk of the assets being removed before the judgment or award is satisfied ... (v) The plaintiff must give an undertaking in damages, which in a suitable case should be supported by a bond or security, and the injunction should only be granted on it being given or on an undertaking that it is to be given."
