Although I agree that the circumstances of this case warrant the grant of such a remedy, it is also clear the principles of law with respect to Mareva injunctions cannot be applied in such a manner as to permit the plaintiff to retain possession of the Zodiac inflatable boats, which were purchased by the defendants in accordance with the terms of the Joint Venture Agreement and are indisputably their property. The court cannot prohibit the defendants from demanding the return of their property, thereby denying them their lawful title to it. Accordingly, the defendants' application for return of the boats is granted.
