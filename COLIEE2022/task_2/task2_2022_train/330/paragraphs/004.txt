In November 1992, the defendants and the plaintiff entered into a Joint Venture Agreement for the purpose of providing a series of environmentally-oriented cruise expeditions sponsored by World Wildlife Federation using the plaintiff's vessel, the M.V. "Northern Ranger". Under the Joint Venture Agreement, one of the obligations of Blyth & Company Travel Limited was to purchase three Zodiac inflatable boats and supporting equipment for use on the expedition. There is no dispute that the defendant fulfilled this obligation and purchased the three boats at a total cost of $60,000, thereafter delivering them to the "Northern Ranger" in late November 1992, just prior to sailing.
