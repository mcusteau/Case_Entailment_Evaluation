The purpose of particulars, as stated by the Court of Appeal in
Gulf Canada Ltd. v. The Mary Mackin
(1984), 52 N.R. 282; 42 C.P.C. 146, is to allow the party requesting them to know the case it has to meet, to prevent surprise at trial, to facilitate the gathering of evidence, to limit the generality of the pleadings, to limit the issues to be tried, and to prevent the party without leave, from going into matters not pleaded or included in the particulars. As a general rule, an order for particulars will not issue unless the party seeking it establishes that they are necessary for pleading and not within its knowledge, and unless the pleadings are, on their face, inadequate or in violation of the rules.
