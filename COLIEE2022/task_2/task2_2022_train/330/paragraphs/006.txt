In April of 1993, after the "Northern Ranger" returned to Canada, a dispute arose between the plaintiff and defendants regarding their respective obligations under the Joint Venture Agreement. The dispute led to the commencement of proceedings in this court by the plaintiff against the defendants in court action number T-1571-93. In their statement of defence and counterclaim, the defendants allege that, despite repeated requests, the plaintiff has refused to return the Zodiacs to Blyth & Company Travel Limited, even in light of the Joint Venture Agreement which clearly states that the Zodiacs are the company's property. The plaintiff admits these facts in paragraph 31 of its statement of defence to the counterclaim, and states that it is holding the Zodiacs as security for sums owing to the plaintiff by the defendants.
