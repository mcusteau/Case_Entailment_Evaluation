After having carefully examined the plaintiff's statement of claim, the defendants' statement of defence and counterclaim and the plaintiff's subsequent statement of defence to the counterclaim, I am not persuaded that this is a case which calls for such an order. The statement of defence to the counterclaim is not so inadequate as to violate the rules of this court. That pleading, together with the plaintiff's statement of claim, unequivocally set out the plaintiff's position and enables the defendants to know the nature of the case against them. If the defendants are of the view they require something more, the plaintiff has offered to consider any questions put to it. In my view, for the reasons set out above, there is nothing more required.
