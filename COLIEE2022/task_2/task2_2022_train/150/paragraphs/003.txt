  The history of this litigation has been clouded by efforts to make discovery difficult and by attempts to avoid having this matter go to trial despite the best efforts of the case management judge. Given the time and effort expended on this motion to dispose of the litigation without a trial, one wonders if that same time, effort and client expense would have been better spent getting this case ready for trial.
