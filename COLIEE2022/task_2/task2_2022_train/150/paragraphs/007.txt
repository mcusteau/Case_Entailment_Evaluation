  SOCAN has the ability, through these various agreements, to authorize public performances of works assigned to it when performed in Canada. SOCAN licenses the performance of the works (usually ex post facto after the performance), collects royalties/fees based on approved tariffs and pays out the royalties to the members whose works have been performed.
