  As a result of the interrelationship between issues, the use of a summary trial process would not be efficient or effective and would result in "litigation in slices". There is no one issue which can be easily segregated and which is dispositive of the case. Even the limitation periods' defence applies to only some of the performances at issue. 
 
 
 
 Therefore, a summary trial will not be ordered. It is more efficient and effective to have all the issues addressed at once against the backdrop of all of the evidence.
