  SOCAN has sued MLSE in late 2004 for failure to pay royalties in respect to more than 40 concerts. The number of concerts at issue is something of a "moving target" and has been changed from time to time. SOCAN has alleged that it is the owner of the works performed at these concerts and that MLSE has authorized their performance without obtaining a licence (either pre or post performance) and has failed to pay the applicable fees governed by Tariff 4A, the operative tariff. 
 
 
 
 SOCAN claims a declaration of failure to report and pay and of infringement, and an order for payment of royalties plus interest, damages, statutory damages and ancillary relief.
