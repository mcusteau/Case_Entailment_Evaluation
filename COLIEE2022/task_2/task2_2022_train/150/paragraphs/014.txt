  The summary judgment, and now summary trial, procedures are important tools for a court to control its case load. Particularly with respect to summary judgments, the Supreme Court of Canada has confirmed its importance in the administration of justice. 
 
 
 
 ... The summary judgment rule serves an important purpose in the civil litigation system. It prevents claims or defences that have no chance of success from proceeding to trial. Trying unmeritorious claims imposes a heavy price in terms of time and cost on the parties to the litigation and on the justice system. It is essential to the proper operation of the justice system and beneficial to the parties that claims that have no chance of success be weeded out at an early stage. Conversely, it is essential to justice that claims disclosing real issues that may be successful proceed to trial.
