  The procedure is ill advised because the negative PRRA decision and the negative H&C decision were decided by the same Visa Officer and each decision is directed to all members of the family jointly. Consequently, if either the PRRA decision or the H&C decision is set aside for reviewable error, each member of the family is entitled to a redetermination on the evidence as it exists on the date of the redetermination. With respect to the Applicant's Application challenging the two decisions, leave was granted, whereas, leave was not granted on the applications of the other members of the family. Since reasons for granting leave are not provided it is not possible to determine in which decision the arguable error was perceived.
