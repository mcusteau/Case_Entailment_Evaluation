  The Applicant's second H&C application was rejected after the PRRA Officer concluded that the Applicant had not adduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate that: 
 
 
 
 i. Mr. Dennehy had a continued interest in harming her, let alone pursuing her to St. Lucia; 
 
 
 
 ii. she would face a risk of unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate, hardship in St. Lucia, particularly given the availability of adequate state protection and a network of family in that country who are in a position to assist with her reintegration there; 
 
 
 
 iii. she would face a risk of such hardship as a result of having to sever her various relationships with friends and her boyfriend in Canada; 
 
 
 
 iv. she would face a risk of such hardship as a result of having to sever her ties to Canada; and 
 
 
 
 v. it would not be in the best interests of her daughter, who attends a private school in St. Lucia, for the Applicant to give up her job in Canada and return to St. Lucia.
