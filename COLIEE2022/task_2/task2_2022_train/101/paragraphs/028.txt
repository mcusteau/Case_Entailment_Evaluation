  More generally, administrative guidelines are not binding and cannot be applied in a manner that unduly fetters a decision maker's discretion ( 
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Thamotharem 
 , 2007 FCA 198 at paras. 62-72). A decision maker must always be free to reach a decision that appropriately reflects the particular facts of the matter before him or her. However, if the decision is contrary, in a substantively important way, to the decision-maker's own guidelines a reasonable explanation should be provided.
