  In April 2003, Mr. Dennehy submitted a sponsorship application for the Applicant. However, the application was returned because there was a missing signature. The Applicant then briefly returned to St. Lucia in June 2003 to renew her visitor's visa. While she was away, she was apparently informed by Mr. Dennehy that he had completed and resubmitted the application and that he had attended an interview in support of the application. The Applicant subsequently learned that her application had not in fact been resubmitted.
