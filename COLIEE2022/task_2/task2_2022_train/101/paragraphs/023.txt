  In summary, I am unable to agree with the Applicant that the Officer breached the rules of procedural fairness by cloaking adverse credibility findings in findings of insufficient evidence, and then not according the Applicant an opportunity to respond to the Officer's concerns. The opportunity for the Applicant to "put her best foot forward" by providing full written representations in relation to all aspects of her application was accorded. This satisfied the participatory rights required by the duty of fairness in this case ( 
 Baker v. 
   
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 34). The Officer was not required to accord the Applicant an interview merely because she did not find the Applicant's representations to be persuasive.
