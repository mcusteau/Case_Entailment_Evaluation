 [15] 
  In Regulation 167 (being the prescribed factors described in s. 113(b)), the Minister is  
 required to consider 
  whether to hold a hearing where there is evidence "that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility". 
 
 
 
 "167. For the purpose of determining whether a hearing is required under paragraph 113(b) of the Act, the factors are the following: 
 
 
 
 (a) whether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility and is related to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act; 
 
 
 
 (b) whether the evidence is central to the decision with respect to the application for protection; and 
 
 
 
 (c) whether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection.
