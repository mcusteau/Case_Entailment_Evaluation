  A new PRRA application was filed. This judicial review relates to that PRRA. The PRRA application was based on the ELF risk, and her religious affiliation with a church opposed to the current government - both these grounds had previously been rejected. The Applicant raised a third and new ground of risk - that of a returning asylum seeker. The claim was supported with documentary evidence of the fate of returning asylum seekers - detention and torture.
