 B010 
 , above, Madam Justice Dawson, with whom Justices Evans and Stratas concurred, had to deal with the definition of "people smuggling" within the meaning of s. 37(1)( 
 b 
 ) of IRPA. The serious question of general importance certified by Mr. Justice Simon NoÃ«l was: 
 
 
 
 For the purposes of paragraph 37(1)( 
 b

 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , is it appropriate to define the term "people smuggling" by relying on section 117 of the same statute rather than a definition contained in an international instrument to which Canada is a signatory?
