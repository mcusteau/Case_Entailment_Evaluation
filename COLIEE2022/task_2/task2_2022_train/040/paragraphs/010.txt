  All I can say is that we have come to a very sad state of affairs. Depending on the member of the RPD who decides the case, a passenger may or may not be found to be a refugee sur place. Even if found to be a refugee sur place, the Minister's application for judicial review may or may not be granted. For instance, in  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v B380 
 , 2012 FC 1334, [2012] FCJ No 1657 (QL), Chief Justice Crampton concluded that the decision of the member in question, whose reasons were not as fulsome as Ms. Bruin's, was unreasonable. Mr. Justice Simon NoÃ«l came to the same conclusion in  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v B451 
 , 2013 FC 441.
