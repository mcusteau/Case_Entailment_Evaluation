  In  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v B344 
 , 2013 FC 447, [2013] FCJ No 547 (QL), Mr. Justice Simon NoÃ«l, again based on the same analysis, concluded that the respondent's Tamil ethnicity was a prime contributing factor and held, based on the mixed motives doctrine, that the decision was reasonable, and so dismissed the Minister's application.
