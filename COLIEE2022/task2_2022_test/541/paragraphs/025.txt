The Board also expressed doubts about not only the marriage certificate, but also the birth certificate, the national identity card and the wedding photographs submitted by the applicant because of a contradiction between the applicant's statements at her initial interview with an immigration officer and her testimony at the hearing. During her testimony, the applicant explained that she had looked for her documents on the morning of her interview with the immigration officer but found only her passport. She later found the rest of her documents, including her marriage certificate, mixed up with her clothing. Because she stated that she had travelled with a single carry-on bag, the Board was of the opinion that it was implausible for her to have lost her documents among her clothes. The applicant then subsequently stated, on the one hand, that she had left for Canada with her marriage papers and, on the other hand, that she had asked her friend to send them to her at the request of her Canadian lawyer. As a result of these contradictions, the Board drew a negative inference about the origin of these documents.
