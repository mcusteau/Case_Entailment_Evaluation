The Board confronted the applicant with these contradictory accounts in order to determine the reason why she had failed to mention a fact as important as a rape during her first interview and in her PIF. The applicant first of all explained that she had realized some two weeks following her wedding that her husband also mistreated his other wives and that she could not continue to live with him. When questioned once again by the Board, the applicant explained that she had told the immigration officer that her problems had begun on her wedding day. Then, with regard to her failure to write this in her PIF, she stated that she did not know what the interpreter who had helped her had written and that she had not understood when the Board asked her if the content of her PIF was true. Finally, she stated that she was ashamed, because rape is something which is not talked about in Guinean society.
