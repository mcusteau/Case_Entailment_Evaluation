The Board also concluded that it was improbable that the applicant would have been paid by her employer for the entire month of July, as shown by her pay slips for that month, although she stated that she had not returned to work since July 2, 2006, and had not provided her employer with a medical report. The applicant alleged that she had simply called in sick without submitting any medical evidence to confirm that. It is true that the Board's conclusion to the effect that even in an African context it was improbable that an employer would pay a salary to an employee who is absent for an entire month without having any evidence of his or her inability to work was not based on any documentary evidence. However, I am not satisfied that this conclusion reached by the Board was unreasonable.
