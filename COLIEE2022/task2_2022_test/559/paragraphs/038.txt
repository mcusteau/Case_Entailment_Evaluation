I am not implying that there was no finding of discrimination. The officer acknowledged that the Roma community continues to experience discrimination in Hungary as well as homosexuals. And, I am dubious of the officer's lack of finding of discrimination towards HIV positive men. His rejection of the NGO report based on the discriminatory experiences of three HIV positive men in Hungary as unhelpful in assessing the health care system as a whole (as stated in issue one, he chose to instead point to his own research which is not specified) is arguably unsound.
