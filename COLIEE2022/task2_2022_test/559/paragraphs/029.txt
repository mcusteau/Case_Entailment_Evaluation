The applicant submits that in some cases cumulative discrimination can amount to persecution as stated in the
Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(Geneva, January 1988) and that the totality of the discrimination borne of factors such as being Roma, homosexual and HIV positive were never adequately addressed by the officer. The applicant submits that the documentary evidence before the officer showed that Roma face discrimination in education, employment and the provision of health care. The applicant stated that the officer failed to take into account the "intersectionality and cumulative nature of the mistreatment" the applicant could face.
