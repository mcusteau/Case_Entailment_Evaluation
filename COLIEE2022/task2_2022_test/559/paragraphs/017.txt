Previous to the important administrative law case of
Dunsmuir
, decisions in the PRRA context used the reasonableness simpliciter standard;
Figurado v. Canada (Solicitor General)
, [2005] F.C.J. No. 458; 262 F.T.R. 219 (F.C.). This standard was collapsed to the standard of reasonableness by
Dunsmuir
and subsequent cases have continued to adopt reasonableness as the standard to use;
Christopher v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2008] F.T.R. Uned. 678; [2008] F.C.J. No. 1199 (F.C.).
