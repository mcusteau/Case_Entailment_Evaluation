In July 2007, the applicant submitted an application for a PRRA that was rejected on October 2007. The rejection was based on the finding that there was no breakdown of state apparatus in Hungary and that certain organizations could be approached for assistance. Since that decision, the applicant learned that he has Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in February 2008. Another PRRA application was submitted in June 2008 which was also rejected on October 10, 2008. Mr. Justice Phelan stayed the applicant's removal in September 2008 pending judicial review of the PRRA decision.
