I turn to the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision in
Munderere
, at paragraph 41, which cites Madam Justice Dawson in
Mete
at paragraphs 4-6 as enunciating three principles of cumulative discrimination amounting to persecution.
"[4] The following three legal principles are not controversial. First, in
Rajudeen v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
(1984), 55 N.R. 129, the Federal Court of Appeal defined persecution in terms of: to harass or afflict with repeated acts of cruelty or annoyance; to afflict persistently; to afflict or punish because of particular opinions or adherence to a particular creed or mode of worship; a particular course or period of systematic infliction of punishment directed against those holding a particular belief; and persistent injury or annoyance from any source.
"[5] Second, in cases where the evidence establishes a series of actions characterized to be discriminatory, and not persecutory, there is a requirement to consider the cumulative nature of that conduct. This requirement reflects the fact that prior incidents are capable of forming the foundation of present fear. See:
Retnem v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
(1991), 132 N.R. 53 (F.C.A.). This is also expressed in the
UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status
(
Handbook on Refugee Status
) in the following terms, at paragraph 53: [Citation omitted]
"[6] Third, it is an error of law for the RPD not to consider the cumulative nature of the conduct directed against a claimant. See:
Bobrik v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1994), 85 F.T.R. 13 (T.D.) at paragraph 22, and the authorities there reviewed by my colleague Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer."
