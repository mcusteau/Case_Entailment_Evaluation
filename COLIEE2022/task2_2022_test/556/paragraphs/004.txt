The applications of all three applicants were given to the visa officer, Mr. Eichhorst, who reviewed the evidence and found that all three applicants were ineligible for employment authorizations. On April 15, 1997, the applicant was denied on the ground that he had not demonstrated that he was seeking entry to Canada for a temporary purpose because he was not transferring to an ongoing, permanent business and he did not have sufficient ties to Pakistan.
