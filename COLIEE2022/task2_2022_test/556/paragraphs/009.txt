The applicant also submits that there is no requirement that there be an established business in Canada. The only requirement is that a permanent and ongoing company be in existence. The applicant submits that it is erroneous to equate "permanent and ongoing" with "established" and "company" with "business".

In this case, Wazir Canada was incorporated and has $100,000 in assets but is not an established business. Therefore, the applicant submits that the visa officer fettered his discretion by adding these additional requirements.
