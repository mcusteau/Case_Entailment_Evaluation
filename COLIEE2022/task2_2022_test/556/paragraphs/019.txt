It appears that the duty to apprise the applicant of the visa officer's concerns is limited. Given that
the applicant must establish
that he has met certain criteria to enter Canada, the applicant should assume that the visa officer's concerns will arise directly from the
Act
or the
Regulations
. This does not mean that the visa officer should remain silent throughout the interview while the applicant states his case. The visa officer should lead the interview and attempt to draw out relevant information about the application. What it does mean is if, for example, an applicant for a visitor's visa has provided weak evidence supporting his position that he has sufficient ties to his home country to ensure his return, then the visa officer does not have to apprise the applicant of this concern. Such a concern arises directly from the
Act
and the
Regulations
. It may be preferable if the visa officer would inform the applicant of this concern but failure to do so does not violate the duty of fairness.
