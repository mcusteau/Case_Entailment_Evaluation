Teitelbaum, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision of a visa officer, Mark Eichhorst who, on April 15, 1997 denied a three year employment authorization to the applicant. This application for judicial review will be heard concurrently with two other applications, specifically IMM-1607-97 and IMM-1617-97. I have written separate reasons for each application for judicial review even though many of the facts are similar.
