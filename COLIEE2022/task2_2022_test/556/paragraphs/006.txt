The applicant cites the decision in
Pangli v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1987), 81 N.R. 216; 4 Imm. L.R.(2d) 266 (F.C.A.), where the court said it was an error for one visa officer to interview the applicant while another visa officer renders the final decision. The applicant contends that this procedure violates the principle that one who hears must decide. In the alternative, the applicant submits that if the visa officer relied on Ms. Solis' findings, then the decision is a nullity because Ms. Solis was not a visa officer and had no authority to make this decision.
