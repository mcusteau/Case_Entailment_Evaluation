There is no doubt that the jurisprudence is clear; the delay of a refugee claim is related to the existence of a subjective fear of persecution, the essential element of a claim. The Board did not accept the applicant's evidence or his explanation to justify the delay and rejected them as unsatisfactory. There is no error of law.

For these reasons, I hereby dismiss the application for judicial review.
