On February 6, 1992, counsel for the plaintiffs wrote to defendant's solicitor requesting further and better particulars with respect to the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim, as well as the Particulars of Objection. The only issue before me on this appeal is the defendant's response that no further particulars were required since the plaintiffs had the knowledge demanded.
