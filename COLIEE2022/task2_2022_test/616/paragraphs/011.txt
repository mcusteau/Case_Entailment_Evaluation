In the case at bar, the burden is on the defendant to establish the facts on which it bases its allegations that the invention described and claimed in the plaintiffs' patent was not novel, was obvious and did not involve any inventive step. The mere reference to a list of other patents and to numerous articles published in various periodicals, (attached as Schedule 1 to the Particulars of Objection), with the contention that the plaintiffs knew and were familiar with them, does not satisfy the burden on the defendant.
