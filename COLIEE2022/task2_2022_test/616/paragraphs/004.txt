[4]
By Notice of Motion in this court dated March 16, 1992, the plaintiffs sought an Order for the particulars requested on the grounds that the allegations in question contained in the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim and the Particulars of Objection, do not meet the requirements of rule 415(1) of the
Federal Court Rules
. The plaintiffs' position is that the allegations were inadequate and so general that particulars were manifestly necessary in order to delineate the matters in issue and enable the plaintiffs to know the case to be met.
