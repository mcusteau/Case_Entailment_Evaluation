In Sabaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] F.C.J. No. 901 (F.C.A.), the Court overturned a panel's decision on the ground that the panel's conclusions were perverse on face of the record and because, in reaching its conclusions, the panel drew unreasonable inferences from the evidence.
