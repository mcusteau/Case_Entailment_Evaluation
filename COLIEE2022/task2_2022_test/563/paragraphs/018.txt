In Bastienne v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 221 (F.C.A.), a panel did not question the credibility of the claimants' testimony of having been imprisoned and brutalized by the authorities in the Seychelles Islands as a result of expressing political opinions but concluded, nevertheless, that the subjective and objective criteria required to satisfy the refugee definition were lacking. The Court overturned the decision on the ground that the panel had erred in failing to consider the evidence and address the question as to whether the treatment the claimants had received amounted to persecution.
