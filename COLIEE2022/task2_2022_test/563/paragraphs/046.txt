Similarly, in D'Mello v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 72, the board had concluded that there was sufficient documentary evidence to support the availability of state protection for domestic abuse, but the Court quashed the decision because other evidence had been ignored:
The CRDD relies upon an excerpt from Human Rights Briefs, Women in India as authority for the proposition that there is, in India, a legislative and procedural framework to which women subject to domestic violence can have recourse. What the CRDD fails to do is make reference to paragraphs following immediately after the citation upon which it relies that reflect on the difficulties encountered by women in relying on that framework and thus, its ineffectiveness. Those difficulties are reflected throughout other portions of the documentary evidence that was before the CRDD ... The principal applicant's fear did not rest on the lack of legislative and procedural framework in India to protect women abused by their husbands or agents of their husbands, but rather on the lack of police support to such women and the difficulty, given the lack of such support, in effectively taking advantage and having recourse to the existing legislative and procedural framework of state protection in India.
