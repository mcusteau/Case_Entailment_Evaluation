[47]
In the case at bar, there was evidence before the Board that St. Lucia does have a legal framework and a government committed to protecting women against domestic abuse. Against this, however, the Applicant asserted the following:
1. there is a difference between a formal legal framework and government statements and what the government and the police can, or are willing, to do when it comes to protecting women subjected to domestic violence;
2. the Applicant did not seek state protection in the past because, given the propensities of the abuser, to do so would have put her life at risk;
3. the Applicant could not seek state protection in the future because she would be subject to the same risk.
