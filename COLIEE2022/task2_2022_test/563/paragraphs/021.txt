The Applicant also refers the Court to Sharma v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1984), 55 N. R. 71 (F.C.A.), where the Court overturned an Appeal Board decision dismissing an application for redetermination in which the Appeal Board had relied on erroneous fact findings in determining that the claimant was not credible. Regarding the effect of the factual errors on the Appeal Board's decision, the Court stated at 72:
It is clear that these erroneous findings of fact were relied upon by the Board in making its adverse finding of credibility and in arriving at its conclusions that the application should not be allowed to proceed to a full hearing and that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee. It is true that the Board also relied upon certain other findings of fact that are supported by the evidence. But in arriving at its adverse finding of credibility and in disposing of the application in the manner that it did, the Board clearly had regard to all of its findings of fact including those, which were entirely without support in the evidence. I do not think this is a case where one can say with any assurance that the Board's conclusion as to credibility and its decision on the merits would have been the same had it not considered its erroneous findings of fact but only the findings of fact that are supported by the evidence. In my view, the Board ought now to reconsider the application for redetermination without having regard to those erroneous findings.
