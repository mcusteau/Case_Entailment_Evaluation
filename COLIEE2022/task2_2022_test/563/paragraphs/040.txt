The Transcript of the hearing shows that the Board took the position that the Applicant had some remedies available to her in St. Lucia (family, she could leave the country, contact the police) but she made no attempt to avail herself of any of them. Her sole attempt at a remedy was to leave St. Lucia and claim refugee status. However, the Board based its Decision upon the availability of adequate state protection.
