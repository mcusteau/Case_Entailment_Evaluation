The crucial issue is whether the state can provide protection in the particular circumstances. I find the words of Mr. Justice Gibson in Elcock v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1438 (T.D.) of particular assistance in this context:
... the CRDD committed a reviewable error in failing to effectively analyse, not merely whether a legislative and procedural framework for protection existed, but also whether the state, through the police, was willing to effectively implement any such framework. Ability of a state to protect must be seen to comprehend not only the existence of an effective legislative and procedural framework but the capacity and the will to effectively implement that framework.
