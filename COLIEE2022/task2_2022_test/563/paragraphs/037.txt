In her affidavit and in her PIF she had said that the police are corrupt and do not offer protection to abused women. Her PIF reads as follows at p. 9:
Knowing the kind of man and the business my boyfriend is involved in, I could not seek government protection. He threatened to kill me if I ever reported him. I fear that if I am forced to return home, I will lose my life to this man. He is dangerous, on drugs, involved with gangs and has a gun which he held to my head before.
The police is (sic) corrupt and does not really offer much protection to abused women.
