The essence of the Applicant's case is that, although the police and the courts in St. Lucia may be committed to enforcing laws to protect women against abuse, this would be of no avail to the Applicant because of the particular situation in which she finds herself. She says that the handling of any abuse case could take years and that, in the interim, her abuser (like many others in St. Lucia) will exact his vengeance upon her and take her life.
