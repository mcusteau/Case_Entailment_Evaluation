She gave evidence of the circumstances that led to her flight from St. Lucia in her PIF:
In 1997, I became involved with a man from St. Lucia. In the beginning of the relationship, we were both very happy and I thought that it was going to last for a very long time and that we would eventually get married.
Within a very short time into the relationship, I discovered marijuana pieces in my boyfriend's pockets clothes and when I confronted him he at first denied using any substance. He later admitted using marijuana but occasionally and he did not see anything wrong with it.
All kinds of people started frequenting our home to buy drugs. And when I told him that I did not approve of his involvement, he became very aggressive and violent. He started beating me every so often. He would sometimes kick and pound me with his fists. Many times he slapped me in the face and for no reason at all. Whenever he became high on drugs I tried to avoid any intimacy with him and this made him extremely angry. He raped me several times and did not see anything wrong with it.
Only my close friend at work and parents got to know of the abuse. I was too embarrassed to tell other people. My father told me to leave him, but I still loved my boyfriend and did not want to return to my parents' home. I tried to talk him into counselling but he would not budge. He did not feel the need for counselling.
Then he started sleeping with other women and again when I confronted him, he beat me up and pulled a gun on my head.
He threatened to beat me if I ever reported to the police. I was so afraid that he would carry out his threat, I chose not to report.
In July 1999, I could not take it any more. I decided to escape the abusive relationship. I went to my sister's home in Boston USA. In December 2000, a friend invited me for a visit in Toronto. On the December 25, while in Toronto, I telephoned my spouse in St. Lucia. He begged me to return home and said that he had changed. I thought about it, but did not believe him.
In early June 2001, I decided to return home to give the relationship a chance. I soon realized that I was pregnant from another relationship. I told my boyfriend and he became very violent. He beat me so hard and said he will never forgive me for cheating on him. He took away my passport and threatened to kill me if I reported to the police.
My father advised me to return to Canada. He and a close friend paid an agent $5000. 00 Eastern Caribbean Dollars to bring me to Canada. On November 5, 2001, I arrived at Toronto with the agent using another person's passport. We parted as soon as we got through all the check points and he left with the passport.
I returned to the friend's home, and was sleeping on the couch for a while but I started getting complications with my pregnancy. She could not care for me and the growing baby. We decided that I should move to a shelter and get more help. It was at the shelter that I applied for refugee status.
I have not heard from my boyfriend since I left St. Lucia. My father told me that he had been to their home several times demanding to know my whereabouts.
Knowing the kind of man and the business that my boyfriend is involved in, I could not seek government protection. He threatened to kill me if I ever reported him. I fear that if I am forced to return home, I will lose my life to this man. He is dangerous, on drugs, involved with gangs and has a gun which he has held to my head before.
The police is corrupt and does not really offer much protection to abused women.
