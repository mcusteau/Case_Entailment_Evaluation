Counsellor Araujo's report also included a one and half page description of the rationale for her decision. The majority of her analysis focussed on the applicant's relationship with his wife and child. In her report, Counsellor Araujo stated that marriage alone is not a sufficient ground for granting an H & C application and noted the couple's separation. While Ms. Atfield considered herself the sole contributor to the problems in the marriage, Counsellor Araujo indicated that she was "not satisfied that Mr. Bolanos is making a concerted effort to mend his marriage." With respect to the couple's child, the Immigration Counsellor described the verbal agreement between the applicant and Ms. Atfield and noted that the applicant's parents and extended family help care for the child. She then assessed the hardship that would be suffered by the applicant's son if the applicant were removed at page 4 of her report:
"It is accepted that both Mr. Bolanos, his family and Ms. Atfield have a strong emotional bond with their son/grandson. They have all shared in parenting and meeting all the child's everyday needs. I have considered the impact on the applicant's son, if his father's application for permanent residence from within Canada is refused. I note that it is the parents who must decide what the best interest of the child. The applicant's son is approximately three years old and not yet of an age where he would recognize or experience ties to any country at this time. I am satisfied that he is young enough and that he would be able to adjust with little difficulty to a move to Mexico if his parents so choose. If the decision is made by the applicant to have his son remain in Canada, I am satisfied that the child will still receive the loving, caring and nurturing environment from his mother with which he is familiar."
