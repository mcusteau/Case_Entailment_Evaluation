[15]
The applicant argues the case at bar should be distinguished from
Hawthorne
because that case dealt with subsection 114(2) of the former
Act
, which had substantially different wording than subsection 25(1) of the
IRPA
. According to the applicant, the law now requires a more detailed assessment of the best interests of a child directly affected by an H & C application than was expressed in the decisions made in the wake of the decision in
Baker
, supra. I am inclined to disagree with the applicant. Subsection 25(1) is a codification of the decision in
Baker
and nothing in its wording indicates that Parliament intended to require a more detailed assessment of the best interests of the child than the one set out by the Supreme Court in that case. As such, cases concerning subsection 114(2) of the former
Act
that post-date
Baker
remain applicable to H & C applications made under the
IRPA
.
