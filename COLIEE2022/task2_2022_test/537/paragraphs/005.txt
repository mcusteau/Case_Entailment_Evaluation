The applicant and Ms. Atfield were interviewed by the Immigration Counsellor in connection with the application on May 15, 2002. Counsellor Araujo later learned from Ms. Atfield's father and the British Columbia Ministry of Children and Families that the couple had separated. She brought them in for a second interview on November 28, 2002, during which the couple confirmed they were no longer co-habiting, but stated they had no plans to divorce. They reached a verbal agreement to share custody of their son, who resides with the applicant and his family. Ms. Atfield is responsible for taking the child to pre-school each morning. Afterwards, she spends time with the child before returning him to the Bolanos' home.
