All of this evidence is consistent with a more or less orderly analysis, assessment, and negotiation of a possible project which, after three and one-half months, it became apparent could not be funded. It is not consistent with an authoritative decision having been taken by March 20th, only one month after receipt of the rather sketchy "training proposal" submitted by the Band, nor is it consistent with even an oral commitment having been made by all those whose approval would be required, including other departments and other governments, on the basis of such sketchy information as was available up to March 20th. I am satisfied that there was neither in fact nor in law any proper decision or authorization by the government for the commitment of public funds in the order of several hundred thousand dollars as of March 20, 1978 when this alleged telephone conversation took place.

Was there ostensibly a decision and commitment by the government?
