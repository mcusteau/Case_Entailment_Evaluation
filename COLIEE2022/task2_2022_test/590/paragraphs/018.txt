It is certainly conceivable that a conversation did take place by telephone on March 20th, even though Mr. Keto had no recollection of it when he appeared for examination for discovery in 1985 nor at the trial in 1988. (This could be consistent with it having been a routine telephone call of no particular importance which would not be remembered some years later). But in the absence of better evidence I am not able to conclude that a contract was formed at that time. From looking at all the surrounding circumstances I am unable to believe that the parties had on that date any animus contrahendi. Mr. Wiebe surely could not have believed that Mr. Keto was making a legal commitment for the Government of Canada to pay whatever amounts might be owing under a contract which had not yet even been drawn up between Arctic Rentals and the Oxford House Band. To do so Mr. Keto would have had to throw all caution to the winds. At that time Mr. Keto was approximately twenty-nine years old and had four years of experience in his Department. He had worked in two other C.M.C. offices before coming to Thompson and had been manager of one of those offices. He held a responsible position at Thompson and was Acting Manager of that office when the Manager was absent. The evidence all indicates that the Oxford House proposal, even in its earliest and most modest cost estimate of $198,000.00 was extraordinarily large for a C.M.I.T.P. program in an office such as Thompson. Having observed Mr. Keto on the stand for many hours, I find it difficult to believe that he would have made such an improvident, open-ended, commitment as the plaintiff alleges was made on March 20th. Even accepting that there may have been some earlier discussion in the Thompson office as to the probability of the total cost of the proposal expanding in terms of numbers of trainees and duration (with attendant increases in the amount of equipment required) there was certainly no hard information available there as to probable costs when Mr. York left to attend a meeting at Oxford House on March 20th. On examination for discovery Mr. Wiebe agreed that he had no indication from any federal government representative that there had been agreement to an expansion of the training program over the one outlined in the proposal from the Oxford House Band prepared in February (P-6). His only information in this respect was from Band members who, he says, told him that the government had approved such an increase as was ultimately written into the contract signed between Arctic Rentals and the Oxford House Band on March 28, 1978 (P-12). Yet what the plaintiff is alleging is that in a telephone conversation of March 20th between Mr. Wiebe and Mr. Keto (according to its statement of claim)
"it was agreed that in consideration of the Plaintiff supplying its equipment, fuel and expertise as set out in the Equipment Rental Contract and the fuel contract, the Defendant, through the government departments named herein, would pay to the Plaintiff all costs of the equipment rental, the training program, and the fuel and other materials supplied to the Band and its Council."
In other words, in the alleged telephone conversation Jeff Keto should be taken to have made a legally binding commitment that the Government of Canada would pay whatever amounts might be specified in two contracts yet to be finalized between Arctic Rentals and the Oxford House Band, without any further opportunity of approving those contracts or of even seeing a draft of them. In fact the Equipment Rental Contract signed on March 28th involves many more costs to the Band, and hence allegedly to the government, than were contemplated in the original Band proposal of February, the only piece of paper on this subject that government representatives had seen prior to March 20th. This agreement involves, for example, equipment rental costs of $212,000.00 payable to Arctic Rentals instead of the $80,000.00 estimated in the original proposal. It includes items such as replacement parts for equipment and repair work not referred to in the February proposal, all of which were to be paid by the Band. It involved "mobilization" and "demobilization" costs not mentioned in the original proposal, these costs ultimately amounting to some $52,000.00. While there is some debate as to what the total cost would have been under the rental agreement as actually signed, even counsel for the plaintiff estimated that the total costs under the two agreements signed on March 28th, would have been $425,912.00 whereas the original training proposal submitted in February would have cost $198,000.00. There was some evidence to indicate that in fact the costs under the agreements as signed would have been closer to $500,000.00.
