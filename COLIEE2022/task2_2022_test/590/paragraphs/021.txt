Even assuming then that the telephone conversation took place on March 20th, and even assuming that Mr. Keto gave favourable indications as to probable approval of the project (and I am not making any finding in this respect) I am unable to conclude that in such circumstances the two parties had, or could reasonably be taken to have had, an intention to enter into a legally binding contract of the kind alleged by the plaintiff. The onus rests on the plaintiff to satisfy the court that such an intention existed, and on the balance of probabilities it has failed to discharge that onus. It appears instead that the plaintiff intended to contract only with the Oxford House Band and it was expected that the Band would, in turn, enter into an agreement as the "employer" with Canada Manpower with respect to the training program [see footnote 1]. The plaintiff must then look to the party with whom it actually made the contract, namely the Oxford House Band, against which it has in fact already commenced action in another court.
