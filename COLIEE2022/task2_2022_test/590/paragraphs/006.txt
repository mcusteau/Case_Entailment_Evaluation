What then happened is a matter on which there is a direct contradiction of evidence with which I shall deal more fully later. Briefly put, Mr. Wiebe says that as a result of a message left for him at the Hudson Bay store in Cross Lake, he phoned Alpheus Hart of the Oxford House Band who told him the project had been approved and that he should bring his equipment in to Oxford House immediately. Further, Mr. Wiebe says that he then phoned Jeff Keto at the Canada Manpower Centre in Thompson for confirmation that the project had been approved. According to him Mr. Keto said it had been approved and when Mr. Wiebe asked him if Arctic Rentals would be paid Mr. Keto said yes. Mr. Keto does not recall any such conversation and there is no record of it on the file at the Canada Manpower Centre.
