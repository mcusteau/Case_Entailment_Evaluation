[22]
In coming to the conclusion that there was no contract between the plaintiff and the defendant because there was no intention to create such a contract, I should not be taken to have denied the existence of such a contract on other grounds. While I accept that in proper circumstances a government official may enter into contracts on behalf of the Crown orally [see footnote 2], and that the Crown may be bound where an official has apparent authority to bind it [see footnote 3] I make no finding with respect to any of these matters in the present case.
