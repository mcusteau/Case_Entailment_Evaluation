Against this background, it appears that steps were taken after the receipt of the Oxford House Band training proposal, around February 20, 1978, for further information to be gathered from the Band, for the project to be assessed and discussed with other relevant departments and with the Keewatin Community College, and for authority to be obtained from the regional headquarters in Winnipeg for negotiation of an agreement between the government and the Oxford House Band with respect to the project. It was understood throughout that the Band would be the employer of the contractor and other persons involved in the project, but all or most of the funding would come from government departments. There was some discussion of the proposal at the C.M.C. in Thompson and obviously William York, a Manpower counsellor there who performed liaison functions with the Oxford House Band, was asked to go to the reserve to discuss the proposal. He wrote a letter on March 15, 1978 to the Band Chief acknowledging the proposal. This letter stated:
"We will not be taking any action on this till I have had a chance to talk to you regarding this proposal. I will be in Oxford House on the 20th of March. I hope you will be available at that time."
He did go to Oxford House on March 20th and attended a meeting with a number of members of the Band. (What happened at that meeting will be discussed below). In the documentary evidence we then find a letter of April 10, 1978 from Neil Heinrichs, the Acting Manager of the C.M.C. in Thompson, to two officials of Indian Affairs and to the Industrial Training Consultant in the Department of Manpower and Immigration in Brandon advising them of a meeting to be held in Thompson on April 26, 1978 to discuss the Oxford House Training Proposal. There are "proposal assessments" dated April 20, 1978, internal documents prepared by Mr. York for the Thompson C.M.C., assessing the proposed training program. On April 26th the meeting took place in Thompson involving representatives of the Band and of the three federal departments as well as representatives from the Keewatin Community College. On May 1, 1978, Mr. McGuire, the Industrial Training Consultant, sent a memorandum to the Regional Director in Winnipeg recommending that Manpower participate in a modified training program for the training of ten heavy equipment operators and three service persons. This was a reduction from the project contemplated by the contract between Arctic Rentals and the Band, of March 28, 1978, which contemplated the training of sixteen operators and three service persons. Further, Mr. McGuire indicated that Manpower officials were trying to get other departments to pay for the road building aspects of the project including matters such as equipment rental and maintenance. He recommended that the Regional Director authorize the Thompson office to negotiate for the expenditure by Manpower of $51,348.96. Somewhat similar recommendations were sent to the Regional Director by the Acting Manager of the Thompson office. On May 3, 1978, a telex was sent from the Regional Headquarters in Winnipeg to the Manager of the Thompson C.M.C. authorizing him to negotiate contracts concerning the Oxford House project to a total of approximately $51,000.00. On May 17, 1978, Mr. Heinrichs, the Acting Manager of the C.M.C. at Thompson wrote to the Chief of the Oxford House Band informing the Band that Heinrichs had received approval to support the training to the extent of paying 77.3% of the cost of trainees' wages for thirteen trainees (ten heavy equipment operators and three service persons) for sixteen weeks. The letter made clear that before final approval the overall project would have to be viable and for that purpose it was anticipated that Indian Affairs would be working out the cost of equipment rentals and other items "which this Department cannot support". Subsequently, at the meeting of June 8th at Oxford House it became apparent that the necessary funding from Indian Affairs was not available and the project could not proceed.
