In the first place, the plaintiff did not in its statement of claim plead quantum meruit as a basis for relief. As there are certain characteristics of this remedy which require that particular facts be pleaded it would not be proper, or fair to the defendant, to find liability on this basis without those facts being alleged and proved. Liability based on quantum meruit essentially requires that (in the context of this case) services be performed at the request or with the acceptance or acquiescence of the defendant [see footnote 5]. Further, the measure of damages is different as between quantum meruit and contract: in contract one can claim for what one would have received under the contract, whereas in a claim for quantum meruit one can claim for the amount of the actual benefit conferred on the defendant [see footnote 6].
