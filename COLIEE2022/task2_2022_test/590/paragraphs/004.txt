Subsequently Mr. Wiebe had continuing discussions with the Oxford House Band and spoke to Mr. Wilson on one or more occasions trying to get some firm indication as to whether funding would be approved by the various government departments for the carrying out of such a project. He was anxious to know this because the Oxford House Band wanted to employ Arctic Rentals for the purpose of the project and his equipment was relatively available, being some fifty miles from Oxford House at Hayes River. Nevertheless, it was important that he know as soon as possible whether Arctic Rentals was to be so employed, because the winter roads would start to deteriorate in the latter part of March and become impassable some time in April. In fact, insurance on equipment moved on winter roads expired as of March 15th because of the additional hazards in the use of such roads after that date. Either the equipment at Hayes River, plus any other equipment required to perform the contract, would have to be moved over winter roads to Oxford House before spring or the equipment at Hayes River would have to be moved out some one hundred and thirty-five miles over winter roads to Jenpeg whence it could be removed over all-weather roads for use in other parts of the province during 1978. Mr. Wilson gave Mr. Wiebe no assurances during these discussions and made it clear he could not authorize such expenditures himself. Other departments and officials would be involved.
