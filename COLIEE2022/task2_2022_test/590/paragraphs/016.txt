There is evidence which does indicate that certain misinformation was conveyed to the Oxford House Band suggesting that governmental approval of funding had already been given in March. William York, who was approximately twenty-six years old at the time of these events and had been employed by Manpower for about one year, testified that as a Manpower counsellor at the Thompson C.M.C. with liaison responsibilities for Oxford House he had discussed the training proposal with Jeff Keto prior to going to Oxford House on March 20th. It was his understanding that funding had been approved and that he was being sent to Oxford House to advise the Band of this. His evidence in this respect was confused and illogical and was contradicted in important aspects by Mr. Wilson and Mr. Keto. It was so completely inconsistent with what the documentary evidence discloses to have been the state of consideration of the training proposal at that time that it is not credible that he was so instructed. It appears that he misunderstood the purpose of his trip. There is considerable evidence that he did, at the meeting on March 20th at Oxford House with the Chief and members of Council and several other members of the Band, state that funding had been approved to some degree by Canada Manpower. At that meeting a Band Council Resolution (Exhibit P-15) was passed in which it is cited that:
"Whereas, the Chief and Council had been advised by the Canada Manpower that their proposal has been approved."
The purpose of the resolution appears to have been to request certain additional funds under the Northlands Agreement (i.e. from D.R.E.E. and Northern Affairs, Manitoba) and from Indian Affairs. The resolution is not very clear as to what categories of expenditures the Chief and Council understood Canada Manpower to be prepared to pay, although on its face the only expenditure by Canada Manpower it specifically mentions is that with respect to 85% of the salaries of the trainees. Clearly the Council thought it necessary to seek funds elsewhere and can hardly have thought all matters to have been settled at that stage. Be that as it may, it appears that the Band Council had formed the belief, on the basis of information provided by Mr. York, that there was some kind of commitment from Canada Manpower with respect to funding of at least part of the project. Mr. York testified, as did others who were present at that meeting on March 20th at Oxford House, that he specifically told the meeting that Manpower would fund trainee salaries up to 85%, the full cost of instructors to a maximum of $100.00 a day, 100% of the cost of equipment rentals and the cost of mobilization. According to those present, in discussions of the total cost of the project the figure of $400,000.00 was frequently mentioned (this in contrast to the original proposal put forward by the Band in writing on February 20th with a cost estimate of $198,000.00). A good deal of this misinformation delivered at the meeting was apparently in turn conveyed to the Department of Indian Affairs regional office in Winnipeg along with the Band Council Resolution of March 20th. On April 11, 1978 Mr. B.G. Boultbee, the Acting Regional Director General of Indian Affairs wrote to the Chief of the Oxford House Band with reference to the Band Council Resolution. He said he understood that Canada Manpower was committed to funding 85% of trainees' salaries for a period of twenty-two weeks and that it was also committed to fund 100% of the costs of equipment rentals. He noted that there was to be a meeting "on March 26th" (this was an erroneous reference apparently to the meeting planned in Thompson for April 26th) at which the plans would "be finalized, and terms of reference be established". This again conveyed the erroneous impression that Manpower had already made a considered decision to fund this project whether or not other departments joined in.
