The Board delivered its reasons orally, refusing the applicant's claim because he was not found to be credible. The Board made the following negative credibility findings:
a) The applicant testified that he was asked by Cocodama to close his shop in March 1998. However, he also stated that his store did not open until April 1998. He was unable to explain this contradiction to the satisfaction of the Board.
b) The applicant stated that his problems began in 1998, while in his U.S. refugee claim he stated that his problems began in September 1991. Further, the Board found that the substance of his claim in the United States was different from the one made in Canada. The Board did not accept his explanation that the person who filled out the application form on his behalf in the United States did not understand Creole well enough. The member did not believe that he would have allowed the form to be submitted without knowing its contents.
c) The Board did not believe that the members of Cocodama would pursue the applicant across the whole country if he sought refuge elsewhere than in Port-de-Paix, where he brought his family after his business was destroyed. The members of Cocodama simply wanted him to close his business, and that he could have continued to work as a cabinet maker elsewhere without the risk of being killed or threatened. The Board also did not believe that Cocodama would still be looking for him if he returned to his country of origin.
d) The Board drew a negative inference from the fact that the applicant withdrew political opinion as a ground upon which he feared persecution. In essence, the applicant claim was solely based on the fact that he lived abroad.
