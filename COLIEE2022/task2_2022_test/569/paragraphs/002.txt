[2]
The applicant raises five issues in the instant case. I would slightly reframe the issues as follows:
a) Did the Board err by determining that Haitian returnees cannot constitute a particular social group as required by section 96 of the Act?
b) Did the Board err by determining that the applicant did not face a particularized risk under section 97, and is therefore not a person in need of protection?
c) Did the Board err by claiming that he had "specialized knowledge" of the facts?
d) Did the Board err by failing to consider any documentary evidence presented to him, or similar decisions made by fellow Board members?
e) Did the Board member's conduct at the hearing raise a reasonable apprehension of bias?
