Before making an application for judicial review of the case, the applicant sought to have the hearing reopened, on the grounds that the member's behaviour at the hearing had violated his right to natural justice. The applicant objected to the failure of the Board to follow the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689, as well as the Board's reliance on "specialized knowledge" without allowing the applicant the opportunity to present evidence to the contrary.
