The respondent submits that the Board's finding that individuals of all social backgrounds are kidnapped in Haiti and the finding that the slum of Cité Soleil is one of the most dangerous parts of the country are not truly based on specialized knowledge. The respondent submits that the Board based the statement on documentary evidence provided by the applicant, and the description of the knowledge as "specialized" is an unfortunate mischaracterization. In support of this submission the respondent cites four excerpts from the documentary evidence contained in the applicant's record in which Cité Soleil is mentioned, and characterized by the violent acts which have occurred there. The respondent cites
Qu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2006] F.C.J. No. 124 (QL), 2006 FC 107 as a precedent in which the Court found that information was wrongly labeled to be specialized knowledge, but that the mischaracterization was immaterial.
