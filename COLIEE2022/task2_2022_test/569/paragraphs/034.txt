The applicant further submits that the Board erred by failing to consider the decisions of other Board members on cases with similar facts, which arrived at opposite conclusions regarding objective conditions. The applicant includes in the record three previous decisions of the Board in which Haitian claimants are found to be at risk on the ground that they are returning to Haiti from abroad. In support of the argument, the applicant cites the recent decision by this Court in
Siddiqui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2007] F.C.J. No. 9 (QL), 2007 FC 6, in which Justice Phelan writes:
[15] In the Board's detailed reasoning as to why it accepted the Respondent's conclusion of reasonable grounds to believe and in its review of the documentary evidence, it makes no reference to the reasoning in the
Memon
case or explain on what basis it differed from the
Memon
case.
. . .
[17] There is no strict legal requirement that the Board members must follow the factual findings of another member. This is particularly so where there is one of the "reasonableness" standards in play -- reasonable people can reasonably disagree.
[18] What undermines the Board's decision is the failure to address the contradictory finding in the
Memon
decision
. It may well be that the member disagreed with the findings in
Memon
and may have had good sustainable reasons for so doing. However, the Applicant is entitled, as a matter of fairness and the rendering of a full decision, to an explanation of why this particular member, reviewing the same documents on the same issue, could reach a different conclusion.
[19] The failure to explain the basis for the different conclusion undermines the integrity of Board decisions and gives them an aura of arbitrariness which is no doubt not intended nor is it acceptable.
