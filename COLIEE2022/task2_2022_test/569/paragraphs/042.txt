[42]
It is sufficient that the applicant raised the question of bias before this Court. It would be overly burdensome to require the applicant to raise the issue of bias of the Board member at the time of the hearing, which in this case was under an hour in duration. Further, in
Benitez
, above, Justice Mosley writes:
[222] I wish to stress, however, that the operation of the doctrine of waiver does not preclude an applicant from arguing that the manner in which the hearing was conducted breached the duty of fairness by reason of, for example, badgering cross-examination as was found in
Herrera
, if that ground is otherwise properly before the Court.
