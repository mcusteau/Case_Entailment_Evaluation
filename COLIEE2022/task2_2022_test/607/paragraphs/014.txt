As far as Guideline 4 is concerned, the applicant alleged that the Board had not taken it into consideration even though it had specifically mentioned having taken it into consideration in its decision. In the applicant's opinion, the Board should have been more sensitive in its assessment of her testimony, especially concerning the sexual assault she had allegedly suffered. She submitted that she did not mention it during her first interview with an immigration officer and in her PIF because of the shame she felt and the ensuing trauma. This trauma also explained her lack of knowledge of the names and the number of the witnesses to her forced marriage.
