On August 5, 2006, a friend of the applicant, worried because the applicant was no longer coming to work, went to visit her at home. She suggested that the applicant leave the country to escape her violent husband and promised to help her. On August 21, 2006, the applicant went to her friend's home. Her friend gave her a French passport, an airline ticket to Canada and the telephone number of one of her friends who was available to help the applicant once she arrived in Canada. She therefore left Guinea on August 21, 2006, and claimed refugee protection on August 23.
