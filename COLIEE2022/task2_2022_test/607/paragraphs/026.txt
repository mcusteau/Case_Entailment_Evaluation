I do not think that the Board erred in finding the applicant not to be credible, and I am of the view that it properly assessed the evidence before it. Even if one accepts that some of the inconsistencies and contradictions in the applicant's narrative could be explained by the horrible violence she states she suffered, her story is nevertheless difficult to understand, given the different versions alleged and the implausibility of her explanations.
