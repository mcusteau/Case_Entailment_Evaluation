The applicant submitted a medical report stating that the [translation] "examination showed the presence of scars which were consistent with (1) a history of laceration with a razor blade on the left cheek, (2) a history of burns from a hot iron on the left breast and extending to the abdomen under the left breast." Although it admitted the existence of these scars, the Board concluded that because of the applicant's total lack of credibility, it did not believe that these scars had been caused in the circumstances alleged by her. Although the violence of the acts that caused her injuries is troubling, I cannot conclude that the Board's decision is unreasonable, considering the applicant's total lack of credibility.
