If it were not for the numerous contradictions in the applicant's testimony, shame could have very well explained why the applicant had not mentioned, before the hearing was held, the rape of which she had been a victim on her wedding day. However, it was only after having tried to give other explanations for her forgetfulness that she gave this explanation, which undermines her credibility even more. In addition, it must be taken into account that the applicant was 38 years old at the time of her marriage and that she had had 12 years of schooling. She did not submit a psychological assessment, which could have corroborated the stress responsible for the memory lapses related to her wedding day. In these circumstances, the Board did not lack sensitivity in doubting the truthfulness of her narrative. Accordingly, I cannot accept the applicant's submissions to the effect that the Board did not take Guideline 4 into consideration in dealing with her claim.
