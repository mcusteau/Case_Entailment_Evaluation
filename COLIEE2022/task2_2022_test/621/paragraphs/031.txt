Of course, the mere use of the words "will" or "would" is not, in and of itself, sufficient to conclude that the officer applied the wrong legal test, especially if this is an isolated occurrence. Regard must be had to the decision as a whole, as this Court has made clear on a number of occasions: see, for example,
Nabi
v.
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1996] F.C.J. No. 325 (QL);
Sivagurunathan
v.
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2005 FC 432. On the other hand, the mere recital at the very end of an assessment of a standard formula with respect to the correct threshold will not cure the deficiencies found elsewhere in the reasons. The present case seems to me to be borderline. If the officer had made no other reviewable error, I do not think this would be sufficient to quash her decision. But it adds to the other problems found with her decision and, cumulatively, they most certainly warrant a new PRRA.
