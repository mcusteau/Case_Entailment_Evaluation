On January 22, 2002, the Convention Refugee Determination Division concluded that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The applicant sought to have this decision judicially reviewed, but his application was dismissed. The applicant then applied for a PRRA which was rejected on July 24, 2006. After this Court granted his motion for a stay of removal, the applicant applied for a second PRRA on December 22, 2006.
