In my view, the following articles are relevant:
Article 3(1):
In all actions concerning children
, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies,
the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration
.
Article 7(1): The child shall be registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from birth to a name, the right to acquire a nationality and,
as far as possible, the right to know and be cared for by his or her parents
.
Article 9(4):
Where such separation results from any action initiated by a State Party
, such as the detention, imprisonment, exile,
deportation
or death (including death arising from any cause while the person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the family with the essential information concerning the whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the provision of the information would be detrimental to the well-being of the child. States Parties shall further ensure that the submission of such a request shall of itself entail no adverse consequences for the person(s) concerned. [My emphasis]
