I do not accept the Wife's evidence that she and her children will be "destitute and itinerant" if the Applicant is removed given that, prior to her marriage to the Applicant, she supported herself and her daughter. However, I do accept that she and the children may face some material hardship once the Wife becomes a single parent with two children.
