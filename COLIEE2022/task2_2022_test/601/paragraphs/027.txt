The Alberta legislation stands in sharp contrast to that of Manitoba, Ontario and Canada. The courts in Manitoba and Ontario have recognized that
Fagnan
gave the Alberta legislation a broad interpretation because there was no provision for leave of the court to file additional expert evidence. This was recognized by Farley, J., in
Bank of America Canada v. Mutual Trust Co. et al.
(1998), 59 O.T.C. 321; 39 O.R.(3d) 134 (Gen. Div.), at pages 137-138:
"In my view the approach in
B.C. Pea
and
Buttrum
is preferable to that of
Scamen
, supra, as interpreted by
Fagnan
. It is clear that in the latter two cases the courts found it necessary to give the section of the Alberta
Evidence
Act
broad interpretation because there was no provision for leave in that section. Had the Alberta legislation incorporated the possibility of leave for more experts if the necessity were demonstrated, then there would not have been any problem in otherwise protecting the interests of justice. In fact just as
Fagnan
was being decided in the Supreme Court of Canada, the Alberta statute was amended to include the following word:
'...
without leave of the court
which shall be applied for before the examination of any such witness.' (Emphasis added)
"This amendment cleared up the problem of future cases in Alberta; however it would not be appropriate to import the pre-amendment remedy from Alberta to Ontario as the Ontario legislation always had the leave protection.
Scamen
and
Fagnan
should be relegated to the curiosity cupboard as obsolete cases which were required to correct an historical oddity of the then Alberta legislation."
