In the
Merck 2003
decision to which the learned Prothonotary referred, the Court held that the same Prothonotary had erred in law by ignoring and failing to follow the jurisprudence of this Court in
Eli Lilly and Co. v. Novopharm Ltd. et al.
(1997), 130 F.T.R. 1; 73 C.P.R.(3d) 371 (T.D.) (
Eli Lilly 1997
), a decision of Reed, J., and
GlaxoSmithKline Inc. v. Apotex
(Sept. 4, 2003) Ottawa T-867-02 (F.C.) (
GlaxoSmith 2003
), a decision of Pinard, J. The
Eli Lilly 1997
decision was upheld on appeal without any reference to the s. 7 issue. Therefore, the only substantive decisions on this matter are those of this Court.
