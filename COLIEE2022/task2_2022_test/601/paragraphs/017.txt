In
Eli Lilly 1997
, Justice Reed was dealing with an action to stop the marketing of the generic version of PROZAC. The action was grounded in passing-off. Importantly, the decision involved three cases of a single plaintiff and a separate defendant in each case. The result is that the decision had one plaintiff and three defendants. The issue of how many "sides" there were is critical to an understanding of Justice Reed's s. 7 ruling.
