The legal issue in this appeal is rooted in Justice Reed's decision in
Eli Lilly 1997
. However, the decision to which the learned Prothonotary referred was that of
Merck 2003
. Justice Heneghan took it as settled jurisprudence on the basis of
Eli Lilly 1997
and
GlaxoSmith 2003
that this Court had determined that each party was entitled as of right to rely on 5 experts per issue in each case. Having accepted that premise, the Court's attention was more particularly focused on the ability of a prothonotary to depart from presumed jurisprudence rather than an in-depth review of that jurisprudence.
