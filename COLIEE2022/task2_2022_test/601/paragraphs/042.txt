In my view, the decision in
Eli Lilly 1997
did not, on its own terms, go as far as has been assumed in later judgments of this Court. Further, the learned justice was not aware that one of the key authorities on which she relied for her understanding of the general state of the law had been overturned. Other courts have later taken a different view of s. 7 than that assumed by Justice Reed and the Supreme Court has since more clearly articulated a concern with expert evidence that she only briefly touched upon.
