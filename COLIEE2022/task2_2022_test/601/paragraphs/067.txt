While the time for seeking leave to adduce more expert evidence should not necessarily be fixed as it is a matter of Court discretion, timeliness is essential. One would have thought that as soon as the expert reports are filed (and perhaps even before when it is known that more expert evidence is required), the necessary motion should, as a general rule, be brought. This is not a matter for determination in this case.
