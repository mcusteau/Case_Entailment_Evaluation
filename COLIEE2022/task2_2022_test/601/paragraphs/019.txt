The salient passage is:
"Section 7 of the
Canada Evidence
Act
provides:
'Where, in any trial or other proceeding, criminal or civil, it is intended by the prosecution or the defence, or by any party, to examine as witnesses professional or other experts entitled according to the law or practice to give
opinion evidence, not more than five
of such witnesses may be called
on either side
without the leave of the court or judge or person presiding.' [Emphasis added.]
"In this case three actions were set down for hearing concurrently, on common evidence. They were not consolidated although Mr. Radomski as counsel for both Apotex and Nu-Pharm essentially proceeded with respect to his clients in a consolidated fashion. Section 7 has been interpreted as referring to
expert opinion
evidence only and as limiting the evidence to five witnesses
per subject matter or factual issue
in a case, not five witnesses in total (
