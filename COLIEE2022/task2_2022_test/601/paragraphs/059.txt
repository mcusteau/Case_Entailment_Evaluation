In the case at bar, because the limit was applied to each issue as the learned Prothonotary concluded she was bound to do, Altana was allowed to use nine expert witnesses who filed 10 affidavits. If Novopharm matched Altana affidavit for affidavit as it would be entitled to do as of right, the hearing judge would be required to review a total of twenty affidavits in chief, without even contemplating reply affidavits. This is a substantial and onerous amount of evidence and severely taxes judicial resources.
