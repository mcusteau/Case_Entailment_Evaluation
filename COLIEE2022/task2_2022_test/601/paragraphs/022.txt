In
Buttrum
, the Ontario Court of Appeal considered s. 12 of the Ontario
Evidence
Act
and held that it restricted the number of experts to 3 witnesses per party, regardless of the number of issues requiring expert evidence. Section 12 of the Ontario
Evidence
Act
, as considered in that case, is similar to s. 7 of the
CEA
.
"12. Where it is intended by a party to examine as witnesses persons entitled, according to the law or practice, to give opinion evidence, not more than three of such witnesses may be called upon either side without the leave of the judge or other person presiding."
