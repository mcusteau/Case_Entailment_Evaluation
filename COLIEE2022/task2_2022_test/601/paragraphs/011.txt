Regarding the standard of review, as held in
Merck & Co. et al. v. Apotex Inc.
(2003), 315 N.R. 175; 2003 FCA 488, this Court will review discretionary decisions of a prothonotary de novo where:
(a) the question raised in the motion is vital to the final issue of the case; or
(b) the order is clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts.
On the issue of error of law, the standard, as held in
Housen v. Nikolaisen et al.
, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235; 286 N.R. 1; 219 Sask.R. 1; 272 W.A.C. 1, is correctness.
