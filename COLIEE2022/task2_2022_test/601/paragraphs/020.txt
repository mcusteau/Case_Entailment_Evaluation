In reviewing the interpretation of s. 7, Justice Reed relied on
Buttrum v. Udell
, [1925] 3 D.L.R. 45 (Ont. S.C.),
Scamen v. Canadian Northern Railway Co.
(1912), 6 D.L.R. 142 (Alta. C.A.),
Fagnan v. Ure
, [1958] S.C.R. 377; 13 D.L.R.(2d) 273,
Hamilton v. Brusnyk
(1960), 28 D.L.R.(2d) 600 (Alta. S.C.),
R. v. Morin
(1991), 16 W.C.B.(2d) 416 (Ont. Gen. Div.), and the
British Columbia Pea Growers Ltd. v. Portage la Prairie (City)
(1963), 43 D.L.R.(2d) 713 (Man. Q.B.), decision at the lower level. Justice Hughes, in his case management decision in
Eli Lilly & Co. et al. v. Apotex Inc.
(2007), 321 F.T.R. 60; 2007 FC 1041 (
Eli Lilly 2007
), pointed out that in the cases cited by Justice Reed, she obviously did not have the Manitoba Court of Appeal's decision in
British Columbia Pea Growers Ltd. v. Portage la Prairie (City)
(1964), 49 D.L.R.(2d) 91 (Man. C.A.), which effectively referred to the trial judgment referred to by Justice Reed.
