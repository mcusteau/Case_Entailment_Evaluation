Justice Granger in
Holmes v. Jarrett
(1993), 68 O.R.(3d) 667 (Gen. Div.),at 673-677, conducted a thorough analysis of the application of stare decisis in regard to judgments of the same court. He concluded that he would only go against a judgment of another judge of his own court if:
(a) subsequent decisions have affected the validity of the impugned judgment;
(b) it is considered that some binding authority in case law or some relevant statute was not considered; and
(c) the judgment was unconsidered, a nisi prius judgment given in circumstances familiar with all trial judges, where the exigencies of the trial require an immediate decision without opportunity to fully consult authority.
