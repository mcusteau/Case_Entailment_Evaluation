First as to Dr. Ennis, he was the physician treating the Applicant at the relevant time. He had a meeting on November 15, 2001 with the Applicant's employer at which time integration of the Applicant back into the workforce was discussed and Dr. Ennis made his views known. Apparently, this discussion was tape recorded but there is no indication that the Investigator asked for the tape or listened to it. The Applicant relied on this discussion to explain why she did not attend a medical assessment requested by her employer; she says it is because the matter has already been discussed at the meeting. The Applicant also asserts that her doctor at the meeting supported the suggestion that the Applicant be allowed to telework. The investigator apparently found the opposite.
