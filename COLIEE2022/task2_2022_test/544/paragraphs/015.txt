It falls to me to consider, in this case, whether the visa officer has erred in his interpretation of the statute, by failing to carry out the assessment that was required of him. In Hajariwala v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (T-720-88, reasons for order rendered November 9, 1988), I articulated the following statement of principles:
"Above all, it is important to bear in mind that parliament's intention in enacting the Immigration Act is to define Canada's immigration policy both to Canadians and to those who wish to come here from abroad. Such a policy cannot exist without complex regulations, a good many of which appear to be restrictive in nature, but the policy should always be interpreted in positive terms. The purpose of the statute is to permit immigration, not prevent it. It follows that applicants have the right to frame their application in a way that maximizes their chances for entry. It is the corresponding obligation of immigration officers to provide a thorough and fair assessment, and to provide adequate reasons for refusals when they occur." [See 23 F.T.R. 241].
