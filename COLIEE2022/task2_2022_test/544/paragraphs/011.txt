In appeal of the refusal for permanent residence, the applicant argues that it is inferential that a person carrying out the occupation of Managing Supervisor, Retail Store and managing a wholesale business of selling office machines has in hand the experience of Sales Representative, Commercial and Industrial Equipment and Supplies, C.C.D.O. 5133-126. The applicant points out that, as he stated in his affdavit, he has significant experience in this occupation. It is also submitted that the visa officer wrongly classified the applicant's application for permanent residence on the basis of the title of the applicant's current occupation, and not on the basis of his actual work experience. The applicant submits, finally, that the visa officer in this case, having determined that the applicant's job description or title more closely duplicated the category of Managing Supervisor, Retail Store, has refused or failed to evaluate the applicant's work experience in the category of 5133-126.
