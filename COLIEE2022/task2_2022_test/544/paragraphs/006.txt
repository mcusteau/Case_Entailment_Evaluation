The facts are contained in the applicant's affidavit, as well as in the affidavit of Anita Sulley, one of his solicitors. The applicant is a citizen of the Philippines who, in April, 1988, submitted an application for permanent residence in Canada to the Canadian Consulate in San Francisco. The applicant's present occupation in the Philippines is that of a proprietor of two businesses, one known as JFC Calculator Centre and the other as East West Emporium. Since the applicant spends approximately 96% of his time dealing with the wholesale distribution of office machines, he considered that the category that best described the duties he has performed throughout his working history was C.C.D.O. classification 5133, "Commercial Travellers". In a letter accompanying his application for permanent residence, the applicant advised the Canadian Consulate General that he had the necessary qualifications as a "Sales Representative, Office Machines under C.C.D.O. 5133-126", a subclassification of 5133. The applicant has submitted as exhibits to his affidavit copies of letters from various wholesalers and retailers of office equipment attesting to his experience, and to the fact that he is a commercial traveller, supplying and selling office equipment.
