Counsel for both parties have made reference during argument to several recent decisions of mine, which address similar fact situations and identical arguments to those before me in this case. In Lim v. Minister of Employment and Immigration et al. (T-598-89, reasons for order rendered July 13, 1989), I described my function in this situation as follows:
"This is not an appellate review. It is an application for exceptional relief by way of certiorari and mandamus. To succeed, the applicant must do more than persuade me that I might have reached a different conclusion from the assessment. He must satisfy me that, as a result of an error in interpretation of the statute, the visa officer failed to carry out the assessment that was required of him, or in the alternative, in carrying out such an assessment, he failed in the duty of fairness to the applicant." [See 29 F.T.R. 277].
