Subsequent to this interview, an exchange of correspondence took place between the visa officer and the applicant's solicitor. In a letter dated February 13, 1989 the visa officer indicated:
"Mr. Li is not believed to be a sales representative of office machines. A close examination of the description of this occupation reveals it refers to the selling of equipment which is 'used in production of goods or services' by the buyer ... At his interview, it was apparent that, if Mr. Li has a wholesale business, it is in sales to retail outlets, not for use by that company, but for resale to customers ...
. . . . .
"The occupation which Mr. Li described in his interview was managing supervisor wholesale establishment (CCDO 5130-122) ... Mr. Li was however classified as a managing supervisor retail store as this appeared to reflect most closely the actual work which Mr. Li does."
