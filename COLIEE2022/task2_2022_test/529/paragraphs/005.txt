The amendments to the
Immigration Regulations
effective May 1, 1997 expressly refer to persons who fall into the applicant's category, that is, persons who were, prior to May 1, 1997, determined not to be Convention Refugees. (See SOR/97-182, s. 5(2)(a).) There is no indication in the amended
Regulations
that their eligibility to be members of the PDRCC is to be determined by application of a repealed
Regulation
. On the contrary, the regulatory impact analysis statement contains the following:
"These provisions will not be applied retroactively. All failed refugee claimants who are currently 'deemed applicants' and for whom a decision remains pending on the day on which these regulations come into force will continue to be considered as 'deemed applicants for landing'.
In all other aspects, however, their applications will be processed in accordance with these amended regulations
." (emphasis added)
It is clear the intention is that the amended regulations apply to all PDRCC applicants, whether their application is deemed to have been made up to April 30, 1997 or whether they make applications subsequently.
