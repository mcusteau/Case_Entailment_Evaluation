The applicant's argument is that he had a vested right to have his PDRCC application considered on the wording of the
Immigration Regulations
in force on July 4, 1996 (when he was deemed to have made his PDRCC application) which did not exclude persons referred to in section F of Article 1 of the
Convention
. The applicant had no such vested right. The right conferred on him by the
Regulations
was that he was to have been deemed to have submitted an application for landing as a member of the PDRCC Class as of that date. But he had no vested right to continuation of the law as it existed when he was deemed to have made his application. (See
Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue
, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 271; 7 N.R. 401, at p. 282.)
