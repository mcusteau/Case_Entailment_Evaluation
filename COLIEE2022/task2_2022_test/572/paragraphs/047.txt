[47]
Having considered the factors contained in rule 400(3) that guide the exercise of discretion on the award of costs, and in particular, the outcome of this proceeding, F. von Langsdorff Licensing Limited must pay the party-and-party costs of S.F. Concrete Technology, Inc. However, I do not find that the conduct of the plaintiff, or the nature of its statement of claim, warrants the award of costs on a solicitor-client basis, or on a high scale.
Summary judgment granted.
