Of more immediate relevance to the generic meaning of eco in this context was the evidence that the words "eco-pavers" or "eco-paving" are used in the industry to describe permeable paving stones generically, and not the plaintiff's in particular. Counsel for the plaintiff queried the partiality of some of those who had used these terms in the generic sense, noted that the plaintiff had protested one such use, and observed that one of the references to eco-pavers occurred in the context of the Australian construction industry. However, the evidence satisfies me that the term "eco" in the construction industry in Canada is not restricted exclusively to the permeable concrete paving stones to which the plaintiff's mark is attached, or more accurately, on which it is engraved.
