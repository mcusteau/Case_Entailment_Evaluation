When this motion was heard, the plaintiff has been using its mark for nearly eight years, whereas the defendant has effectively been stopped by the litigation instituted by the plaintiff from using its mark in Canada at all. Considered in isolation, this would suggest that "Uni Eco-Stone" has established some association with the plaintiff's stone by the time that the defendant started to advertise and to solicit licensees for "SF-Eco Stones".
