By letter dated June 14, 2005, the visa officer denied the Applicant's application for permanent residence on the ground that the evidence regarding his occupation and military service was not credible. The visa officer concluded that the Applicant was neither a member of the Convention Refugees Abroad or Humanitarian-protected Persons Abroad classes within the meaning of sections 145 and 147 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 (the Regulations). The letter reads in material part:
Paragraph 16(1) of the Act stated that a person who makes an application must answer truthfully all questions put to them for the purpose of an examination and must produce a visa and all relevant evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires.
After carefully assessing all factors relative to your application, I am not satisfied that you are a member of any of the classes prescribed because your answers to my questions were contradictory and evasive during the interview. I did not find credible your explanations about your military service and your occupation in Afghanistan and Tajikistan. Therefore, you do not meet the requirements of this paragraph.
Subsection 11(1) of the Act states that:
A foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the Regulations. The visa or document shall be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of the Act.
Subsection 2(2) specifies that, unless otherwise indicated, references in the Act to "this Act" included regulations made under it.
Following an examination of your application, I am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of the Act and the Regulations for the reasons explained above. I am therefore refusing your application.
