The Court is unable to resolve this conflicting evidence in favour of the Applicant. The CAIPS notes at the first interview disclose that the Applicant served as a private at the airport in Kabul, which could reasonably be based on the ensuing statement that the military booklet was viewed. The notes further state that the officer had "no particular security concerns" which may also have been concluded on a viewing of the same document. Officer Drouin in his November 2, 2005 affidavit attests that the contents of the CAIPS notes were true and accurate, that the Applicant produced his military booklet at the time of his first interview, and that he viewed and noted seeing that document. It cannot be concluded, therefore, that the visa officer's finding that he had seen the booklet at the first interview is without regard to evidence in the record.
