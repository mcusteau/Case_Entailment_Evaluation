It was not for the visa officer at the second interview to suggest to the Applicant that he seek out new evidence after the hearing to rebut the informant's claims. That onus was on the Applicant. By cross-examination January 30, 2006, on his affidavit sworn on November 2, 2005, Officer Drouin stated that he would have examined such evidence had the Applicant produced it:
[504] Q - Was there any particular hurry to make a decision in this case after the second interview?
A - No, no special hurry
[505] Q - Was there - did you offer them time to try and obtain documents to refute the allegations?
A - No. I mean, if they had provided me with these documents, I would have looked at them.
