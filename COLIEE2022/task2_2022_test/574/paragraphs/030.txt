The Applicant submits that the visa officer was unreasonable in preferring the informant's allegations of criminality over the Applicant's evidence denying those claims. The Respondent submits that the visa officer made no finding in respect of the Applicant's criminal inadmissibility to Canada, for which reason it cannot be concluded the officer preferred the informant's evidence over the Applicant's. The Respondent submits that the visa officer confronted the Applicant with the informant's allegations of criminality and reasonably concluded that the Applicant was not credible by reason of his vague and evasive answers in connection with his military activities and occupation in Afghanistan.
