It is settled law that on judicial review, evidence that was not put before a decision maker is not admissible before the reviewing Court: see Asafov v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), (1994), 48 A.C.W.S. (3d) 623 (F.C.T.D.), [1994] F.C. J. No. 717 (T.D.) (QL). The Federal Court of Appeal held in Bekker v. Canada, 2004 FCA 186. (2004), 323 N.R. 195 (F.C.A.), that the nature of judicial review limits the Court to assessing the legality of decisions based on the record that was before the decision maker.

As Rothstein J.A. said in Gitxsan Treaty Society v. Hospital Employees' Union, [2000] 1 F.C. 135, at paragraph 15, "the essential purpose of judicial review is the review of decisions" and, I would add, to merely ascertain their legality: see also Offshore Logistics Inc. v. Intl. Longshoremen's Assoc. 269 (2000), 257 N.R. 338 (F.C.A.). This is the reason why, barring exceptional circumstances such as bias or jurisdictional questions, which may not appear on the record, the reviewing Court is bound by and limited to the record that was before the judge or the Board. Fairness to the parties and the court or tribunal under review dictates such a limitation. ...
