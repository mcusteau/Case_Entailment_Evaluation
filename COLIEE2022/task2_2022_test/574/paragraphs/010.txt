Three issues are raised on this application:
A. Can the Court consider evidence that was not before the visa officer?
B. Did the visa officer breach the duty of fairness by failing to provide the Applicant with a meaningful opportunity to respond to the allegations of criminality?
C. Did the visa officer err in making a global adverse credibility finding by reason that:
(1) the Applicant's evidence regarding his military booklet was internally contradictory?; and
(2) untested evidence alleging the Applicant's criminality was preferred over the Applicant's testimony?
