Blanchard, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of the decision, dated June 14, 2005, of Nicolas Drouin (the visa officer) at the Canadian Embassy in Moscow, Russia, which determined that the Applicant does not meet the requirements to be issued a permanent resident visa because he is not a member of the Convention Refugee Abroad or Humanitarian-protected Persons Abroad classes. The visa officer concluded that the Applicant did not meet the requirements of subsections 11(1) and 16(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act) by reason that the evidence regarding his occupation and military service was not credible.
