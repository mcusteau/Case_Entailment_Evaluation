The applicants argue, on their part, that while they have the overall legal burden, there is an evidential burden placed upon Novopharm to adduce sufficient evidence to justify its allegation of noninfringement. As Novopharm has not adduced any evidence, the applicants conclude that it has not satisfied its evidential burden. The applicants add that as Novopharm is the only party having knowledge of the facts relevant to the product which it intends to sell and to the process for making it, it has the common law burden to disclose and prove such facts, and has failed to do so in this instance. Finally, the applicants argue that irrespective of where the burden lies, Novopharm had the legal obligation to provide a detailed statement of the legal and factual basis for its allegation, and concludes that the failure to do so is, in itself, a sufficient ground for concluding that the allegation made by Novopharm is not justified.
