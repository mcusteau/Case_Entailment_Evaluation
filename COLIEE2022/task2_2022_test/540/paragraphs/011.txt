A number of fundamental questions relevant to the issue of burden in proceedings under the
Regulations
have now been settled by this court. The first is that the second person is the master of its allegation and that the court cannot compel it to provide a further and better statement thereof or to otherwise perfect it. (Per Strayer, J.A., in
Bayer A.G. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) and Apotex Inc.
(1995), 179 N.R. 122; 60 C.P.R.(3d) 129 (C.A.), at 134 [C.P.R.].) The second is that the facts asserted by a second person in support of an allegation are presumed to be true unless and until the contrary can be shown by the first person. (Per Hugessen, J.A., in
Merck Frosst Canada Inc. v. Canada
(1994), 169 N.R. 342; 55 C.P.R.(3d) 302 (F.C.A.), at 319. [C.P.R.]) The third is that, while it is the first person which, as the initiator of the proceedings, has the carriage of the matter and bears the legal burden, there is an evidential burden placed on the second person requiring it to advance facts which, if assumed or proven, can justify the allegation made in the notice of allegation. (Per Hugessen, J.A., in
Merck
, supra, at 319 [C.P.R.] As to the second part of this proposition, see also Strayer, J.A., in
Bayer A.G.
, supra, at 134 [C.P.R.], and McGillis, J., in
AB Hassle v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(1994), 81 F.T.R. 17; 55 C.P.R.(3d) 323 (T.D.), at 327 [C.P.R.].) Finally, despite the "difficult" and "awkward" position in which the first person is placed in having to disprove the second person's allegation, neither the statutory presumption contained in the
Patent Act
, nor the common law presumption which casts upon the party which has the knowledge of the facts the burden to prove them, come to its assistance. (Per Hugessen, J.A., in
Pharmacia Inc. et al. v. David Bull Laboratories (Canada) Inc.
(1995), 191 N.R. 157 (F.C.A.), at p. 2, confirming the conclusion reached by Wetston, J., in
Pharmacia Inc. et al. v. Canada
(1995), 92 F.T.R. 253; 60 C.P.R.(3d) 328 (T.D.), at 340 [C.P.R.]. See also Cullen, J., in
Eli Lilly & Co. v. Novopharm Ltd.
(1995), 90 F.T.R. 241; 60 C.P.R.(3d) 163 (T.D.), at pp. 172, 173 and 174. [C.P.R.])
