On February 9, 1995, the applicants filed an originating notice of motion in which they applied for an order prohibiting the Minister from issuing a notice of compliance to Novopharm. It alleges that the notice of allegation and the statement of the legal and factual basis filed by the respondent do not justify the allegations it has made, and do not comply with s. 5(3)(a) of the
Regulations
. The notice of motion was supported by the affidavit of Mr. Lorenzo Biondi, Vice-President, Scientific Affairs of Hoffmann-La Roche ("the Biondi affidavit"). No facts are asserted with respect to the patents in issue although they were appended to the Biondi affidavit as exhibits thereto.
