This scheme insofar as the burden is concerned operates on the basis that the facts advanced by a second person in support of its allegation are presumed to be true until the contrary can be shown (Thereby relieving the second person from the basic tenet that "he who asserts must prove". See
Robin v. National Trust Co.
, [1927] A.C. 515, at 220), and the first person bears the burden of disproving those facts which, if left unchallenged, would allow the court to conclude that the second person's allegation has been made out. (Much the same as the facts relied upon by the Minister of Revenue to raise an assessment under the
Income Tax Act
are presumed to be true thereby casting on the taxpayer the burden to disprove them.) I take it from the foregoing that, in order for a second person to succeed in a prohibition proceeding strictly on the basis of the presumption (That is, by asserting facts but adducing no evidence), its allegation must, as a minimum, be supported by the assertion of a fact or facts which, if assumed or presumed, can lead to a conclusion that "... no claim ... would be infringed" (That is the conclusion that must be reached if the second person is to succeed. See s. 7(2)(b)). Where no such facts are alleged by the second person and no evidence is adduced by it, there is nothing to which the presumption which operates in its favour can attach, and hence no factual basis upon which a conclusion favourable to the second person can be reached.
