What the Biondi affidavit does assert is that the applicants have no knowledge, nor access to knowledge, relevant to the composition or active ingredient, or to the processes used to manufacture the composition or active ingredient, of Novopharm's proposed ketorolac tromethamine. The application also contained a request that the Minister send to the applicant and the registry a certified copy of Novopharm's submission under the
Food and Drug Regulations
for the NOC in issue. The request was not complied with by the Minister. Novopharm, for its part, took the position that this information ought not to be disclosed because
it was the confidential information of a third party manufacturer and in any event because:
"The details of the chemical process of manufacture of ketorolac tromethamine are not relevant to this proceeding, in particular, to the Notice of Allegation or to the Detailed Statement of Legal and Factual Basis for the Allegation of Novopharm Limited." (Applicants' Record, at 174.)
