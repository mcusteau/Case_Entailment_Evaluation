A multi-step process is described in patent 1,102,809 for the synthesis of the novel 5-aroyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo {1,2-a}pyrrole-l-carboxylic acid derivatives. This process is illustrated in the following reaction sequence wherein R and R
1
have the above-indicated meaning and R
2
is a lower alkyl group of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, e.g., methyl, ethyl, isopropyl and n-butyl:

The main steps of the applicants' process, as they can be gathered from the description of the process at pages 6 to 13 of the patent, can be summarized as follows: (Applicants' Record, at 71-80; I have labelled these steps from 1 to 10 for ease of reference only. Roman numerals in parentheses refer to the chemical formulae in the reaction sequence pictured above.)
1a.	To prepare a compound of Formula (IV) wherein R is hydrogen:
Reaction of equimolecular amounts of ethanolamine (I) and dimethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate (II) to form a solution of the vinylamine of Formula (III).
Treatment of this solution, preferably in situ, in a suitable inert organic solvent, under anhydrous conditions, with 2-bromoacetaldehyde or 2-chloroacetaldeyde to prepare the compound of Formula (IV) wherein R is hydrogen.
OR		1b.	To prepare a compound of Formula (IV) wherein R is a lower alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms:
Treatment of an aqueous mixture of ethanolamine (I) and dimethyl 1,3-acetonedicarboxylate (II) with a compound of the formula
[see printed version]
wherein X is bromo or chloro and R
3
is a lower alkyl group of from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.
2a.	Esterification of compound (IV) with methane-sulfonyl chloride in the presence of a tertiary amine, optionally in the presence of a cosolvent such as dichloromethane to produce the corresponding mesylate of Formula (V).
Conversion of the mesylate of Formula (V) into the corresponding N-(2-iodethyl)pyrrole of Formula (VI) by reaction with sodium iodide in acetonitrile solution.
Reaction of the iodoethyl compounds of Formula (VI) with sodium hydride in a suitable inert organic solvent to obtain dimethyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrolo {1,2-a}pyrrole-1,7-dicarboxylate and the 6-alkyl substituted derivatives thereof (VII).
OR:		2b.	Direct cyclization of the mesylate (V) with sodium hydride in dimothylformamide solution to produce the compounds of Formula (VII).
3.	Basic hydrolysis of a compound of Formula (VII) with an alkali metal hydroxide or alkali metal carbonate in an aqueous lower aliphatic alcohol affording the corresponding free diacid of Formula (VIII).
4.	Selective esterification of the carboxylic acid group at the C-1 position in compound (VIII) by treatment with a lower aliphatic alcohol in the presence of hydrogen chloride to produce the corresponding alkyl 1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrrole{1,2-a}pyrrole-1-carboxylate-7-carboxylic acid of Formula (IX).
5.	Decarboxylation of the monoesterified compounds (IX) to the corresponding compounds of Formula (X).
6.	Condensation of a compound (X) with an amide of the formula
wherein R
1
has the above-indicated meaning, affording the corresponding alkyl 5-aroyl-1,2-dihydro-3H-pyrollo{1,2-a}pyrrole-1-carboxylate (XI).
7.	Alkaline hydrolysis of the alkyl ester group in a compound of Formula (XI) to obtain the corresponding free acid of Formula (A).
The specification further provides that the compounds of Formula (A) wherein R and R
1
are both hydrogen can be subjected to further treatment in accordance with the following flow diagram:

8.	The compounds of Formula (A) can be resolved to obtain the corresponding individual isomers thereof.
9. 	High pressure liquid chromotography (HPLC) can be applied to the α-phenethyl diastereoisomeric esters of the compounds of Formula (A), followed by acid cleavage to obtain the (l)-acid isomers and (d)-acid isomers of the compounds of Formula (A).
10.	Salt derivatives of the compounds of Formula (A) and the (l)-acid isomers are prepared by treating these free acids with an appropriate amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable base.
