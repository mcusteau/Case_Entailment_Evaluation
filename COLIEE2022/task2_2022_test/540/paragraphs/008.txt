The respondent, on the other hand, contends that the applicants, because they bear the overall legal burden, had to adduce evidence establishing that their patents would be infringed if an NOC was issued. Since they have failed to adduce any evidence, the respondent concludes that the application must fail. With respect to the sufficiency of its allegation or lack thereof, the respondent states that the regulations "do not prescribe any particular format or content for this statement and this Honourable Court has no jurisdiction over it". (Respondent's Memorandum, p. 8, par. 10.) It adds that the fact that the details of the process of manufacture of ketorolac tromethamine are the confidential information of a third party manufacturer, is a relevant consideration in ascertaining the extent of the information which the respondent is bound to disclose. It concludes by stating that, in any event, there is no obligation on its part to adduce any evidence until the applicants have satisfied their onus, and as the applicants have adduced no evidence, their application must be denied. (The respondent also argued that the applicants had failed to establish that they were a "first person" within the meaning of s. 4 of the
Regulations
because they have not advanced any evidence establishing that they had obtained a notice of compliance for the drug in issue (Respondent's Memorandum, p. 8, par. 14). However, as the respondent's allegation is based on a comparison which it wishes to make with the drug of the applicants and as, pursuant to s. 5(1), it can only ask that this comparison be made with a drug that has been the subject of an NOC, there can be no basis for its allegation unless the drug in issue has been the subject of an NOC. It follows that it is not open to the respondents to raise this issue in the context of these proceedings. Section 5(1) insofar as it is relevant provides:
"5(1) Where a person files (...) a submission for a notice of compliance in respect of a drug and wishes to compare that drug with (...) a drug that has been marketed in Canada pursuant to a notice of compliance (...), the person shall (...)
(b) allege that
(iv)	no claim (etc.)")
