The applicants also point out that if the statement by the second person to the effect that its process is not the same as that of the first person was viewed as a statement of fact to which the presumption attached, they could not possibly disprove such a fact. Indeed, as the respondent is relying exclusively on this presumption, it has not disclosed any fact relating to the process per se. It follows that the applicants cannot challenge the affirmation made by the second person that its process is different because they have no knowledge of this process. In the end, if the respondent's assertion was to be viewed as an allegation of fact to which the presumption attached, it would be beyond the reach of the applicants, and the court, confronted with this presumed fact, would have no choice but to conclude that the respondent's allegation has been made out.
