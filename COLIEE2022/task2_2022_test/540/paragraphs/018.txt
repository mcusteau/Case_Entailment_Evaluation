That is not what the
Regulations
contemplate. The
Regulations
contemplate that a second person can facilitate the issuance of an NOC for its drug by comparing it to a patented drug with respect to which an NOC has already been issued provided that the second person can allege noninfringement. If it can and chooses to do so, the quid pro quo is that the first person is notified of this allegation and is given an opportunity to challenge it before the second NOC can be issued. (This is the essence of the regulatory scheme as summarized by Mahoney, J.A., in
Bayer A.G.
, supra, at 331 [C.P.R.].) Obviously, an isolated allegation by the second person to the effect that there is no infringement because its process is not the same or is different from that used by the first person, without anything more, would not allow such a challenge as it alleges no facts which the first person can possibly disprove.
