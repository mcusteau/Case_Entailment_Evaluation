The applicant is a citizen of Romania and she lives there with her family. Born in September 1976, she works as an exotic dancer at a night club in Brasov. Through a local agency there she contracted with an employment entertainment agency and she signed an agreement with a night club in Toronto to work for some six months or so, performing "striptease (nude) stage shows" and "striptease (nude) table dance shows". The night club where she worked in Romania supplied her with a reference letter recommending her for work abroad as a "striptease dancer". That club also indicated its intention to re-employ her when she returned to Romania at the end of her contract.
