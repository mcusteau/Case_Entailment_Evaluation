To a large extent, what is recorded in the Security Intelligence Report on Mr. Brown's file is that the allegation was made by JB that Mr. Brown had assaulted him, that criminal charges were laid, and that these charges were subsequently dropped. That an allegation was made against Mr. Brown by JB, resulting in criminal charges being laid is a historical fact, and the statements in Mr. Brown's file to this effect are entirely accurate, up to date and complete.
