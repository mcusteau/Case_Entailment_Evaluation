I have reviewed the decision in
Tehrankari
, and in particular have considered the pragmatic and functional analysis carried out by Justice Lemieux in that case leading to his conclusion that decisions of the sort in issue here are to be reviewed against the standard of reasonableness. I am satisfied that, as was the case in
Tehrankari
, this case involves the application of provisions of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
to a specific set of facts, and that in these circumstances, the decision of the commissioner's delegate should be reviewed against the standard of reasonableness.
