That being said, neither decision can be said to support the proposition that reverse order questioning inherently violates a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness. As stated by Chief JusticeBlanchard in Thamotharen at paragraph 91:
The intervener has provided some evidence pointing to the difficulties refugee claimants face and the benefits to them of "counsel-first" questioning. However, in my view, neither the applicant nor the intervener has established that the principles of natural justice or procedural fairness require that refugee claimants be afforded an "examination-in-chief" in order for the refugee determination process before the Board to be fair. The opportunity for the applicant to make written submissions and provide evidence to the Board, to have an oral hearing with the participation of counsel, and to make oral submissions, in my opinion, satisfies the requirements of the participatory rights required by the duty of fairness in this case.
