The applicant relies on the decision in Acevedo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 738, to support his assertion that a prospective analysis is required. While Justice Michael A. Kelen did state in Acevedo that a refugee analysis is prospective, he also noted at paragraph 12 that “[i] n order to make this forward-looking decision, the Board must necessarily look to information about what has happened in the recent past”. Furthermore, the application for judicial review was granted in that particular case because the Board made a patently unreasonable finding of fact, not because it considered what had happened in the past in making a determination.
