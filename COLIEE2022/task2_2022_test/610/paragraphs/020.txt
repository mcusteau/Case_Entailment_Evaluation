While this Court recognizes the different circumstances under which the POE notes and the PIF are prepared, it has long been established that POE notes are admissible evidence before the Board (Multani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 361). Furthermore, while a small divergence between the PIF and the POE notes should not be deemed fatal to an assessment of credibility, there is ample jurisprudence to the effect that discrepancies between the POE notes and the PIF may be considered by the Board in assessing the credibility of an applicant and that the Board is entitled to draw negative inferences from any significant omission in the POE notes (Sava v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 445). As noted by Justice Konrad W. von Finckenstein in Markandu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2004] F.C.J. No. 956, at paragraph 5: “One of the key tools available to the Board to test the credibility of an applicant is to compare his PIF and POE statements and question him about any discrepancy during the hearing.”
