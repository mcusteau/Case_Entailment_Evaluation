The quoted paragraph is critical to the analysis performed by the CRDD in relation to the element of the applicant's refugee claim that counsel for the applicant considered to be most cogent. No quarrel can be taken with the statement that the claimant was one of three persons involved in the workplace protest. Equally, there was before the CRDD no evidence that the two others with whom he worked were harmed in any manner. Unlike counsel for the applicant, I do not read this statement as in any sense inaccurate or leading to an implicit conclusion that his two colleagues were not harmed in any manner. It goes no further on its face than to indicate that there was no evidence before the CRDD to indicate that the applicant's colleagues had been harmed.
