Counsel for the applicant placed much stress upon the ordering of the analysis in the CRDD's decision which dealt first with the applicant's participation with the pro-democracy student movement on two occasions as a participant in large rallies. Only after introduction of this element of the applicant's participation in the pro-democracy movement in the spring of 1989 does the analysis turn to the applicant's role as an active leader of protest at his workplace on at least two separate and distinct occasions. Counsel alleged that this constituted a mischaracterization of the applicant's claim in that the principal base of the claim was his leadership at his place of work rather than his participation in major rallies. Counsel went on to suggest that the CRDD adopted this approach in order to enable itself to more effectively take advantage of what he referred to as a "template" analysis provided to members of the CRDD for their consideration in cases where they had concluded that a negative decision in respect of an applicant from China would be issued.
