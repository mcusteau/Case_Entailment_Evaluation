[4]
The issues in this matter were stated on behalf of the applicant in the following terms:
Did the CRDD err in law by basing its decision on a serious mischaracterization of the applicant's refugee claim, such that it did not face this real claim?
Did the CRDD deny the applicant natural justice or otherwise err in law by fettering its analysis of a substantive portion of his claim in this case to an illfitting "template" analysis of negative PRC decisions?
Did the CRDD draw erroneous conclusions of fact upon a disregard of the evidence before it?
Did the CRDD draw erroneous conclusions based on irrelevant considerations?
Did the CRDD fail to exercise its jurisdiction to consider the applicant's
sur place
refugee claim, particularly trustworthy photographic and newspaper evidence in support of that portion of the claim?
Did the CRDD wrongly declare the applicant's
sur place
claim abandoned, without giving him an opportunity to show cause why it should not be declared to be abandoned, contrary to the provisions of the
Immigration Act
and its own rules?
