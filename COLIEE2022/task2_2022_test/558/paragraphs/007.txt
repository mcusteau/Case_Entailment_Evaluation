The Applicant argues that the Commission should have not taken such a rigid view of his case when it determined the claim was statute-barred. He states the only reason it took him so long to file his complaint with the Commission was that he was pursuing his dispute through internal dispute resolution mechanisms and that it was only when he realized, first, that the hiring procedure had been conducted in a discriminatory fashion by CCRA, and, second, that the resolution procedures within CCRA would not compensate him adequately, that he brought his complaint to the Commission. During his oral arguments, the Applicant admitted that he was hoping for a successful result from the dispute resolution mechanisms and that it was only after receiving the negative result from CCRA that he decided to file a complaint with the Commission. He also admitted that the acts upon which the complaint was based were known to him since October 2001, though he did receive some additional information in September 2002.
