Because of the particulars of this case and considering the preliminary matter brought up by the Respondent, the Court will not ignore or strike the evidence in question, taking in consideration the conclusion arrived at by the Commission. The Court considers the evidence as facts which exemplify the situation. That the Applicant spent most of the year between September 2001 and September 2002 attempting to resolve his situation via dispute resolution mechanisms confirms that he was aware of the information that could constitute a complaint before the Commission by September 2002 at the latest. Since the Applicant is self-represented, the documentation filed which originates from the Applicant, is an explanation of how the situation was viewed by the person concerned.
