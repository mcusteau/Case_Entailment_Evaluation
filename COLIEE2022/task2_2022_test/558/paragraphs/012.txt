Section 41(1) grants the Commission a large discretion in determining whether a claim should be accepted by it for investigation, and therefore, the Respondent's argument that such a decision should be reviewed only on a very deferential standard (i.e., patent unreasonableness) is correct. (See
Price v. Concord Transportation Inc.
, supra, at paragraphs 36 to 42.)
