Mr. Davey did admit that the complaint with the Commission was not filed within the one (1) year period because he was hoping for a successful result from the internal dispute mechanism. Furthermore, he also admitted that he had the complete information to support the acts (of September and October 2001) upon which the complaint is based in September 2002 when a staffing manager told him about the contents of the references from supervisors which may have prejudiced his job promotion. It is not until August 2003 that the Applicant approached the Commission and only in October 2003 that the complaint is officially filed. This is two (2) years after the occurrence of the acts on which the complaint is based.
