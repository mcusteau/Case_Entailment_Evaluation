As a preliminary matter, the Respondents brought to the attention of the Court the fact that the Applicant was adducing evidence that was not before the Commission when it made its decision and that therefore, it should be ignored by the Court or that the Court should strike the evidence in question. The said evidence can be found at paragraphs 2 to 5 and Exhibits A, B and C of the Affidavit of the Applicant.
