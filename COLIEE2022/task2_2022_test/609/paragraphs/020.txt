In the circumstances, it can only but be determined that no conversation was recorded, and thus no personal information collected. In this case, and following the Privacy Commissioner's line of argument on this issue, there is no actual violation of
PIPEDA
. Under
PIPEDA
, there is no provision stating that the attempted collection of personal information constitutes a violation of the
Act
. The privacy obligations in
PIPEDA
are found in Schedule 1 of the
Act
. This outlines duties and recommendations that organizations either must, or should (depending on the case), follow when handling of personal information. These are based on the following 10 principles: Accountability; Identifying Purposes; Consent; Limiting Collection; Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention; Accuracy; Safeguards; Openness; Individual Access; and Challenging Compliance. None of these principles, nor any provision of
PIPEDA
make reference to "attempts". Rather, the actions contemplated by the
Act
are those involving the actual collection, use and disclosure of information. The principles and provisions of
PIPEDA
are clearly structured so as to assume that information sought by an organization is, in fact, collected. Where statutory terms are thus clear and straightforward, they should be understood by their ordinary meaning, and the Courts should not impose additional meanings clearly not intended by Parliament: see R. Sullivan,
Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes
(Markham (Ont.): Butterworths, 2002), at pages 19 et seq.
Potential remedies
If there was a violation of the Applicant's rights under PIPEDA, what remedies are available to the Applicant? This includes the question, if it becomes necessary, of whether the Court has jurisdiction to grant additional remedies not authorized by PIPEDA.
