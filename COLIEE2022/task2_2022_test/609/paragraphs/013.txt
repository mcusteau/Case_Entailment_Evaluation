Alta Flights recognizes and accepts the finding and conclusion of the Privacy Commissioner as accurate, based upon the facts and the provisions of the
Act
. It further indicates its agreement with the Privacy Commissioner's proposition that
PIPEDA
only provides for remedies following the unauthorized collection, use and disclosure of personal information, and that there is no authority within
PIPEDA
, or case-law generally, to create attempts to violate
PIPEDA's
provisions as a separate breach of the
Act
. It disagrees with the Applicant's proposition that since a test of the digital recorder was completed successfully, it should be further concluded that an actual taping of a conversation between the Applicant and her co-workers occurred.
