The evidence on the record indicates that when the tape recorder was discovered by Ms. Morgan and another employee, it had captured Ms. Hobbs' testing of the device: "testing, testing, testing." However, no one has been able to clarify whether any additional information or conversations were recorded. Ms. Morgan advised she heard Ms. Hobbs' voice on the machine (while Ms. Hobbs was testing it), and then possibly nothing more; but in an attempt to determine whether anything further was on the tape, the tape was inadvertently erased. No evidence has been provided to the contrary. I cannot agree with the Applicant's submission that since a test was done before the installation of the device under the table, it is logical to assume that more information was registered by the recorder. This is not what the evidence shows. At paragraph 13 of her affidavit, the Applicant refers to an "attempted invasion of my privacy." The complaint itself, signed by the Applicant and Ms. Janice Rowe, qualifies the recording in the following manner: "we believe the intentions of this recorder were to record employees." Furthermore, during the cross-examination on her affidavit, the Applicant indicates, at pages 15, 16 and 17 of the transcript, what was on the recording device "Pat's voice was on there saying, testing, testing, testing." The only words they heard were those; therefore, the evidence cannot support a determination that more than the words "testing, testing, testing," were recorded.
