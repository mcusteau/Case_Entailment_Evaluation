Upon concluding its investigation into Ms. Morgan's complaint, the Privacy Commissioner advised Mrs. Morgan, on April 12, 2004, that although it disapproved of the actions taken by Alta Flights in seeking to collect the information in question, there was no collection of any personal information, since no recording had actually been made of the smoke room conversation. Consequently, there was no contravention of any relevant provision of
PIPEDA
:
"Our investigation determined that the tape was erased. Consequently, there is no evidence that personal information had been collected or used. I therefore cannot find Alta Flights in contravention of any relevant provision of the
Act
.
"Accordingly, I conclude that your complaints are not well-founded.
"Notwithstanding this, Alta Flights should not interpret my finding as an approval of what the company attempted to do. Had the manager been successful in obtaining information via the digital recorder, I would not, in the circumstances, have been inclined to accept the company's reliance on paragraph 7(1)(b) to justify collecting personal information in such a manner.
"Paragraph 7(1)(b) cannot be read in isolation, and therefore cannot be relied upon to justify any collection of personal information without knowledge and consent under just any circumstances. In our view, an organization must have substantial evidence to support the suspicion that the employee is engaged in wrongdoing or that the relationship of trust had been broken, must be able to show that it has exhausted all other means of obtaining the information that it required in less privacy-invasive ways, and must limit the collection to the purposes to the greatest extent possible.
"In this instance, there were rumours of theft, fraud, and possible assault. But these were anecdotes, and anecdotes do not qualify as substantial evidence. Moreover, some of this information was given to the manager after she had placed the recorder in the public smoking room. Did the manager try to obtain information in a less privacy-invasive manner about these incidents before taping a digital recorder to the underside of a table? Did she alert all employees to the problems? Did she first speak with these individuals about her suspicions? It would appear that she did not.
"Then there is the measure itself. A tape recorder, placed in a room accessible to many individuals, some customers, some employees, is a highly indiscriminate means of collecting information. The company contends that the timeframe of the taping limited the chance of others being recorded. Nevertheless, this was a public room, and regardless of whether a flight was scheduled to arrive that night or not, the company could not guarantee that only the complainants would be using the facility. The recorder appears to have been placed there on the off chance that some information might be captured. Such an approach to investigating possible employee wrongdoing is not privacy conscious to say the least.
"The electronic surveillance of employees when there is a suspected breach of the employment contract is a measure that should never be taken lightly or easily. It should be the very last step - if taken at all - in a series of steps, approved of by a very senior level of management, to obtain information regarding employee wrongdoing and must be based on substantial evidence. The circumstances in this case, simply put, would not measure up."
