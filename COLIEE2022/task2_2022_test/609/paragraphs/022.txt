Ms. Morgan's frustration at the lack of a remedy under
PIPEDA
is understandable, but until Parliament indicates otherwise, one cannot take so liberal an approach to the interpretation of
PIPEDA
so as to change its fundamental shape and remedies. Having said this, there are other remedies available to Ms. Morgan, such as that in s. 184 of the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which includes the possibility of compensation up to $5,000.00 (see s. 194 of the
Criminal Code
). Other remedies may also be available to her in common law.
