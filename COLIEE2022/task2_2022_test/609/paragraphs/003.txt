Briefly, for the reasons stated below, I would answer the above questions as follows:
- Since there is no evidence that any conversations were, in fact, recorded by Alta Flights, as the tape was inadvertently erased by the employees who found the recording device and all that was heard from the recording device before the erasure were the words "testing, testing, testing," Alta Flights did not actually manage to collect and/or use any personal information. Therefore, there was no violation of
PIPEDA
since the law of attempted breach does not exist under the
Act
.
- Since there was no violation of the Applicant's rights under
PIPEDA
, there is no need to elaborate further on the remedies sought by the Applicant.
