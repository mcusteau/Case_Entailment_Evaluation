The Board devoted much of its decision to the issue whether there were reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Thanaratnam was a member of an organization involved in criminal activities. Here again, it relied on the evidence of experienced police officers. It also considered the criteria used by the police to decide whether a person was involved in activities that could be characterized as gang-related. To repeat, in respect of Mr. Thanaratnam, the Board concluded:
I believe the evidence places him on many occasions in the company of persons also alleged to be involved in criminal/gang activities. In my estimation a reasonable person viewing all the evidence put together at this hearing would conclude he was part of this gang activity. In the final analysis of the overall evidence therefore, I am satisfied that the test of "reasonable grounds to believe" he is a member of the V.V.T. or engages in activities undertaken by this group has been met.
