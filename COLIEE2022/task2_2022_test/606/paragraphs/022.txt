Here, the Board found the evidence, both oral and documentary, relating to Mr. Thanaratnam's various interactions with the police to be credible. It also considered Mr. Thanaratnam's five actual criminal convictions.

However, as will be seen below, I find that the Board's ultimate conclusion that Mr. Thanaratnam was a member of a criminal organization is unsupported by that evidence.
B. Was the Board's definition of "organization" correct?
