O'Reilly, J.
: Mr. Sharone Thanaratnam is a permanent resident of Canada and a citizen of Sri Lanka. He is 26 years old. There are two grounds on which the Minister bases his efforts to remove Mr. Thanaratnam from Canada. First, the Minister alleges that Mr. Thanaratnam has been convicted of an offence punishable by five or more years of imprisonment (Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, s. 27(1)(d); relevant enactments are set out in an Annex). He also alleges that there are reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Thanaratnam is a member of a criminal organization - namely, a Toronto Tamil gang (Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, ss. 27(1)(a), 19(1)(c.2)).
