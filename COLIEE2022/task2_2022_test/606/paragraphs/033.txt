Mr. Thanaratnam argues that the Board erred in arriving at this finding. In particular, he suggests that the Board's conclusion was the product of speculation and stereotyping. He claims there was no evidence that he was personally involved in planning any gang activity or took orders from the gang leadership. Rather, he says, the Board simply assumed that his association with other persons with the same background combined with spontaneous criminal acts amounted to proof of membership in a gang.
