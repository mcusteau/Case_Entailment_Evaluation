On the whole, the Board found that the documentary evidence and the police officers' testimony were reliable. From that evidence, it concluded that Mr. Thanaratnam was indeed a member of a Tamil gang called the V.V.T.:
I believe the evidence places [Mr. Thanaratnam] on many occasions in the company of persons also alleged to be involved in criminal/gang activities. In my estimation a reasonable person viewing all the evidence put together at this hearing would conclude he was part of this gang activity. In the final analysis of the overall evidence therefore, I am satisfied that the test of "reasonable grounds to believe" he is a member of the V.V.T. or engages in activities undertaken by this group has been met.
