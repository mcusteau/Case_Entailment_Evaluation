The Board is not bound by "any legal or technical rules of evidence". It may rely on any evidence it considers "credible or trustworthy in the circumstances" (Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, ss. 173(c),(d)). Mr. Thanaratnam acknowledges that the Board has a great deal of flexibility in terms of the evidence it may consider. However, he argues that any evidence that amounts to hearsay should be given little or no weight.
