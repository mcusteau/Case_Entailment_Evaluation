The Board proceeded properly by hearing and relying on evidence it found credible and trustworthy. Its finding that the gang Mr. Thanaratnam was alleged to be part of was an "organization" for purposes of s. 37(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was consistent with the evidence before it. However, the Board's conclusion that Mr. Thanaratnam was a member of a gang was not supported by the evidence. Therefore, this application for judicial review is allowed and the matter is referred back to the Board for redetermination by a different panel. Since the only matter that is in doubt is whether Mr. Thanaratnam is a member of a criminal organization, the new hearing should be confined to that issue.
