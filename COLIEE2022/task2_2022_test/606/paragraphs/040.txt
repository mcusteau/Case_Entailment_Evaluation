One of the police witnesses, Detective Constable Smith, testified that he thought a third criterion was satisfied in Mr. Thanaratnam's case; namely, "previous court findings including, but not limited to sworn testimonials that the person is a gang member or gang associate". He believed that Mr. Thanaratnam's criminal record provided that evidence. However, there is nothing on the face of Mr. Thanaratnam's criminal record that would indicate that there had been court findings or even testimony to the effect that Mr. Thanaratnam was a member of a gang. Indeed, Detective Constable Smith himself did not go that far in his testimony before the Board. He was only able to say, based on the entire package of police information on Mr. Thanaratnam, that "all incidents, criminal convictions, arrests, associations, it's all part of a belief that a person is entrenched completely within a sub-culture . . . and take part in criminality. That, I believe, is supported in this package and taking it all into consideration that finding I think is obvious". He did not say that the evidence he had compiled, much of it hearsay in any case, would sustain an inference that Mr. Thanaratnam was a member of a gang.
