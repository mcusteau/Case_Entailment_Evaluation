Police would consider a person to be a gang member only if the first of these criteria was met, along with at least two others. The Board rightly noted that it was not bound by these criteria. At the same time, however, the Board relied heavily on the testimony and documentary evidence tendered by police witnesses to conclude that there were reasonable grounds for believing Mr. Thanaratnam was a gang member. Yet, as I read the evidence, the criteria used by the police themselves did not appear to be met. As mentioned, there was some evidence that Mr. Thanaratnam was involved in gang-related events and that he was occasionally seen associating with gang members. However, I cannot find in the evidence anything that would satisfy any of the other police criteria for determining gang membership or, indeed, would otherwise indicate that Mr. Thanaratnam actually belonged to a gang.
