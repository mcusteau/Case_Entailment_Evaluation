Still, there is an important balance to be struck. On the one hand, Parliament has established a fairly low evidentiary threshold in this area and has given the decision-maker a good deal of freedom to receive any evidence it considers reliable, whether or not it would normally be admissible in a court. Clearly, Parliament wanted the Board to have a maximum amount of flexibility. Further, it did not want to impose a burdensome evidentiary threshold on the Minister. Yet, the other side of this equation must be emphasized. The reasonable grounds standard operates as a protection against arbitrary, capricious or ill-founded state action. As Dickson C.J. points out, it is this standard that must be satisfied before the state can interfere with an individual's right to be left alone. It is an important and meaningful threshold. It requires an objective assessment and can be satisfied only where it is supported by credible evidence.
