Mr. Thanaratnam argues that the Board should not have relied to any significant degree on evidence of his conduct other than the crimes of which he had actually been convicted. The Board considered various police reports and the testimony of experienced police officers in arriving at its conclusion that Mr. Thanaratnam was a member of a criminal organization. According to these sources of information, Mr. Thanaratnam was believed to have been involved in a number of criminal matters but they either did not proceed to trial or he was acquitted. Further, some reports showed he was a victim of crimes rather than the alleged perpetrator.
