Second, the question whether a person constitutes a danger to the public, the issue in Bakchiev, was specifically connected to actual convictions under the prevailing statute. The relevant provision of the Immigration Act, s. 53(1), applied to persons who there were reasonable grounds to believe had been convicted of serious criminal offences. It expressly referred to persons described in ss. 19(1)(c), 19(1)(c.1)(i), 27(1)(a.1)(i) and 27(1)(d) of the Act, all of which related to persons convicted of crimes. Accordingly, it was appropriate that a danger opinion be based solely on evidence of convictions, not mere allegations of wrongdoing, because of the clear ambit of the relevant provisions.
