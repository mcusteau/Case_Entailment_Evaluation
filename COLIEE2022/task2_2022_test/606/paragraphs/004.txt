The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27, came into force while this matter was before the Board. For present purposes, there is no material difference between that statute and its predecessor, the Immigration Act. Throughout the remainder of these reasons, I will refer to the new Act, unless the context requires otherwise.
