According to paragraph 37(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, a person is inadmissible to Canada if he or she is a member of an organization believed on reasonable grounds to be involved in a pattern of criminal activity planned and organized by a number of persons acting in concert. Clearly, there was evidence before the Board indicating that the two Tamil groups were involved in various criminal activities and that those activities were carried out by a number of persons together as directed by the groups' leaders. The question that remains is whether those groups could be described as "organizations".
