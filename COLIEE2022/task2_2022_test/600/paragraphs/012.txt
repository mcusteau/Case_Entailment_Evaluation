Nor am I able to conclude from a review of the Registrar's decision that he misapprehended the amount of evidence required to discharge the evidential burden lying on the opponent. Indeed, the argument of counsel for the appellant on this issue is not a novel one, a similar contention having been raised by the opponent in Tune Masters v. Mr. P's Mastertune (1986), 10 C.P.R.(3d) 84 (Opp. Bd.). In that case, there was a similar allegation of noncompliance with the provisions of s. 29(b) of the Act, and the agent for the opponent argued that the question of the evidential burden should be governed by the common law rule that a party is obliged to prove those facts particularly within his knowledge. The same hearing officer who wrote the decision presently under appeal obviously did not fully agree, when he stated at p. 89:
"... It is clear from the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in the Playboy Enterprises case noted above ([Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Germain (1979), 43 C.P.R.(2d) 271] at pp. 274-275 of the reported reasons) that the fact that an applicant may have the best knowledge as to whether and when he has used his trademark does not remove the evidential burden on an opponent with respect to a ground of opposition of noncompliance with s. 29(b) of the Act. However, it is apparent that in a situation such as the present it is difficult for an opponent to prove an allegation of nonuse by an applicant, the relevant facts being more readily available to the applicant. In such circumstances, the appropriate test is as stated in Cross on Evidence (6th Ed. 1985), at p. 121 as follows:
'The most that can be said by way of generalisation is that a party's knowledge of essential facts may lessen the amount of evidence required to discharge an evidential burden borne by his adversary.'
"As stated by Buckley, L.J., in Dunlop Holdings Ltd.'s Appl'n, [1979] R.P.C. 523 at p. 544:
'Where the relevant facts are peculiarly within the knowledge of one party, it is perhaps relevant to have in mind the rule as stated in Stephen's Digest, which is cited at page 86 of Cross on Evidence:
"In considering the amount of evidence necessary to shift the burden of proof, the court has regard to the opportunities of knowledge with respect to the facts to be proved which may be possessed by the parties respectively."
'"This does not mean", Sir Rupert continues, "that the peculiar means of knowledge of one of the parties relieves the other of the burden of adducing some evidence with regard to the facts in question, although very slight evidence will often suffice."'
"With respect to the opponent's first Â ground of opposition, the opponent does have 'opportunities of knowledge' but the applicant obviously has more. Thus, the evidential burden on the opponent is less than in the ordinary case."
