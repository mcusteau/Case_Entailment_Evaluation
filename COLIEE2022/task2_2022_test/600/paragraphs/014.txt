The sole issue, therefore, as it seems to me, is whether the Registrar's assessment of the evidence led by the opponent was wrong in the circumstances. Appellant's counsel submits on this point that, even if the Registrar was correct in his consideration of the evidential burden, nevertheless he erred in finding that the opponent had failed to "prove" its allegations. In his submission, the Registrar gave insufficient weight to the Stocco affidavit, erred in rejecting the first Phenix affidavit, and mistakenly failed to take into consideration the applicant's failure to file any evidence in answer to these affidavits. I am unable to agree. Mr. Stocco, in his affidavit sworn March 25, 1982, is exceedingly vague in outlining his qualifications, expertise and employment history prior to his appointment as Assistant to the Director of National Advertising of a subsidiary of the opponent. Moreover, I agree with counsel for the respondent that the statements contained in the following operative paragraphs of the Stocco affidavit are so vague and lacking in specificity as to render them virtually meaningless:
"3. Throughout the period 1968 to date, as indicated above, I have been Â involved in the alcoholic brewery beverage industry and have been generally aware of brands of alcoholic beverage products extant in the marketplace.
"4. To the best of my knowledge and belief there is not now, and has not been, an alcoholic brewery beverage on sale in Canada labelled 'Molson's Blue'."
(See in this regard: Maligne Building Ltd. et al. v. Minister of the Environment of Canada (1980), 37 N.R. 562; 54 C.P.R.(2d) 11 (sub nom. R. v. Maligne Building Ltd.) (F.C.A.).) Mr. Stocco was not cross-examined on his affidavit. In any event, I find his evidence to be unconvincing. Hence, I am unable to conclude that the Registrar was wrong in determining that the Stocco evidence was insufficient to discharge the appellant's evidential burden.
