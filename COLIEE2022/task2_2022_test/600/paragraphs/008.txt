The relevant portions of the Registrar's decision dealing with the s. 29(b) issue deserve to be set out in full:
"With respect to the opponent's ground of opposition based on noncompliance with s. 29(b) of the Trade Marks Act, the legal burden is on the applicant to show that its application complies with s. 29(b) of the Act. However, insofar as the opponent relies on allegations of fact in support of its ground of opposition, there is an evidential burden upon the opponent to prove those allegations. For a more complete discussion of this matter, reference may be made to the unreported opposition decision in Joseph E. Seagram & Sons Limited v. Seagram Real Estate Ltd. (S.N. 397,826; November 1984). The material time for considering the circumstances respecting this ground of opposition is the filing date of the application.
"... The first Phenix affidavit relates to circumstances well after the material time and I have not considered it.
"In his affidavit, Mr. Stocco identifies himself as Assistant to the Director of National Advertising of Labatt Brewing Company Limited which he identifies as a subsidiary of the opponent. Mr. Stocco states that his current position requires him to be familiar with brands of 'alcoholic brewery beverages' sold by his company's competitors in Canada. Mr. Stocco states that he has been employed by his company or a predecessor of his company in the marketing area since 1971 and that, prior to that time, he worked for a company which was also involved in the alcoholic brewery beverage industry. Mr. Stocco then makes the following statement:
'To the best of my knowledge and belief there is not now, and has not been, an alcoholic brewery beverage on sale in Canada labelled "Molson's Blue".'
"The net effect of the foregoing is that Mr. Stocco's affidavit constitutes the only admissible evidence that is relevant to the issue at hand. In this regard, I would note that Mr. Stocco is employed by a subsidiary of the opponent and his affidavit is not as clear as it could be respecting his knowledge and expertise prior to assuming his current position. Thus, I consider that the opponent has not adduced sufficient admissible evidence from which it could reasonably be concluded that the applicant's predecessor in title has not used the trademark 'Molson's Blue' since March 1962 or at all. Consequently, the opponent's first ground of opposition is unsuccessful."
