While it is well established that there is a duty to act fairly in administrative matters, the scope of that duty will vary with the circumstances. For example, in
Shah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 170 N.R. 238 (F.C.A.), Hugessen, J.A., said that the content of the duty of fairness owed by a visa officer in assessing an application for landing on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was "minimal". An "H and C" application is purely discretionary and the law gives the applicant no right to any particular outcome. In the case at bar, however, the applicant initially appeared to have fulfilled the requirements for a visa and, indeed, was granted a visa. It could be argued that the decision to revoke her visa should give rise to more stringent requirements of procedural fairness. However, the issuance of a visa is still part of the statutory scheme in which s. 8 of the
Immigration Act
states that "where a person seeks to come into Canada, the burden of proving that that person has a right to come into Canada or that his admission would not be contrary to this Act or the regulations rests on that person".
