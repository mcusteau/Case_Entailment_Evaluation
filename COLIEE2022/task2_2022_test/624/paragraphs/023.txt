In my view, Parliament, in s. 82.1(10), has sought to strike a reasonable balance between the competing interests of the individual and the state. I accept that the applicant is somewhat handicapped in her ability to make a full and fair response. It must be remembered, however, that this matter does not fall into the criminal context where the full force of the state can be brought to bear against a person who is convicted. The applicant is merely denied the opportunity to come to Canada and, as already mentioned, noncitizens do not have an unqualified right to enter the country. Furthermore, while fundamental justice demands a fair procedure, it does not demand a perfect system of full disclosure and a full oral hearing in every case. The principles of fundamental justice are not immutable, but can vary according to the context in which they are invoked: see
