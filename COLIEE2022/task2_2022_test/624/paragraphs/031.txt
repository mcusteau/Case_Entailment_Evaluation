I do not accept the applicant's submissions. The applicant ostensibly did not attend the interview because the visa officer refused to have her counsel present. In my view, the applicant did not have a right to have her counsel present at the interview with the visa officer. The
Immigration Act
does not explicitly confer a right to counsel on persons making an application for landing, even though there is provision for counsel under other procedures under the
Act
. In my view, the visa officer fulfilled his duty of fairness by offering the applicant an interview. He had no obligation to offer an interview with the applicant's counsel present. Furthermore, I am not willing to speculate whether the visa officer would not have given the applicant a chance to "make her case" at interview. I accept that, based on the information the visa officer had at the time that he contacted the applicant, he believed that the applicant was inadmissable, but what if the applicant had brought completely new information to light at the interview? The visa officer may well have taken that new information into account and arrived at a different decision. This, however, is speculative, given that the applicant did not avail herself of the opportunity to attend the interview with the visa officer. In my view, the visa officer acted fairly by offering the applicant a chance to attend an interview and make her case.
