Section 7 of the
Charter
reads as follows:
"7. Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
As indicated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General) et al.
, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519; 158 N.R. 1; 34 B.C.A.C. 1; 56 W.A.C. 1, at p. 584 [S.C.R.], the approach to be taken in assessing an alleged violation of the s. 7 has two stages: first, the court must determine whether there has been a deprivation of the right to life, liberty or security of the person and, second, the court must consider whether the infringement or deprivation was in conformity with the principles of fundamental justice.
