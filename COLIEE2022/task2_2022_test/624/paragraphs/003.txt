On January 19, 1993, the Hong Kong Government provided the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong with information indicating that in 1972 the applicant was registered as being married to Benton Cheun Yan Loong (also known as Cheun Yan Lung, also known as Benton Cheun Yan Lung, also known as Benton Cheung Yan Loon). On February 4, 1993, the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong wrote to the applicant, asking her to provide particulars of her marriage to Cheung Yan Lung Benton and to explain why she described herself as "never married" in her application for permanent residence in Canada. The applicant's lawyer, Victor Yang, wrote to the Canadian Commission on March 2, 1993 and indicated that the applicant is the concubine of Benton Cheung Yan Lung. She described her marital status as "never married" in her application because she had never registered her marriage in the marriage registry in Hong Kong. This explanation was accepted by the visa officer. A concubine in Hong Kong is the second wife of a man in Hong Kong and was permitted under Hong Kong law (the Marriage Ordinance) until 1975.
