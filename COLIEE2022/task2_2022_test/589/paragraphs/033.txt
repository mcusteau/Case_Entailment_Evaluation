The respondent submits that the Board did not believe that the applicant had been tortured or imprisoned in Tunisia or that he was a person identified by the authorities as an Islamic sympathizer. Consequently, the respondent suggests that there were no serious reasons to believe that the applicant was a "person in need of protection" and the Board did not err in its application of s. 97 of the Act. The respondent further states that, if the applicant's argument concerning the proper interpretation of s. 97 were accepted, all claimants from Tunisia would automatically be granted the status of "persons in need of protection" under the Act.
