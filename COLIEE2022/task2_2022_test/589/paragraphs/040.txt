In Kaveh Yaragh Tala v. Sweden (Communication No. 43/1996, U.N. Doc. CAT/C/17/D/43/1996) [hereinafter Tala] the CAT repeated the passage from Khan quoted above. In Tala, the credibility of the claimant was at issue. However, the CAT concluded that substantial grounds existed for believing that Mr. Tala would be in danger of being subjected to torture if returned to his home country. It stated, at 10.3:
The State party has pointed to contradictions and inconsistencies in the author's story, but the Committee considers that
complete accuracy is seldom to be expected by victims of torture and that the inconsistencies that exist in the author's presentation of the facts do not raise doubts about the general veracity of his claims
, especially since it has been demonstrated that the author suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Further, the Committee has noted from the medical evidence that the scars on the author's thighs could only have been caused by a burn and that this burn could only have been inflicted intentionally by a person other than the author himself.
