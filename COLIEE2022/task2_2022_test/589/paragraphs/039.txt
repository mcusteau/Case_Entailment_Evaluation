It appears from the wording of Article 3 of the Convention that the substantial grounds must be evaluated with respect to "all relevant considerations", including the existence of a "consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights". However, it is clear from the CAT's decision in Khan that the existence of a pattern of human rights abuses in a country is not, in itself, sufficient to show that an individual would be personally at risk.
