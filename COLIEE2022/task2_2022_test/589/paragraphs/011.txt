Finally, the Board found that the applicant had contradicted himself concerning his arrest on April 13, 1997. The applicant declared that on April 13, 1997, the police came to his house and took him to the police station. However, during another part of his testimony he stated that he was given a summons on April 12, 1997, and that he went to the police station on April 13, 1997. Confronted with this inconsistency, the applicant stated that two policemen came to his house on April 12, 1997, and then gave him the summons to appear on April 13, 1997. The Board did not accept this explanation, because the summons states that it was received by the applicant on April 13, 1997. Consequently, it drew a negative credibility inference.
