The applicant's argument on bias should have been raised at the earliest opportunity at the hearing. However, even if the argument of bias had been before the Board at the hearing, I am of the view that there is insufficient evidence to support the applicant's contention that the Board member had a reasonable apprehension of bias. The inconsistency, noted by the Board in the applicant's testimony regarding the April 1997 interrogation, is well founded in the evidence and the Board's adverse credibility finding cannot be said to be patently unreasonable. I do not view these findings as evidence of bias. Based on the evidence before me and applying the test as set out by the Supreme Court in Comm. for Justice, supra, the applicant's argument that the Board member had a reasonable apprehension of bias cannot be sustained.
(ii) Did the Board fail to give due regard to the applicant's medical reports?
