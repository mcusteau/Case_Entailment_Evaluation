The treatment of s. 97 has not yet been fully considered by this Court owing to the Act's recent vintage. To properly assess the issue raised by the applicant, I will review certain articles of the International Convention Against Torture which are incorporated in s. 97 of the Act. In circumstances where there is no jurisprudence of this Court on this issue, my analysis will be guided by certain decisions of the United Nations Committee Against Torture (CAT).
