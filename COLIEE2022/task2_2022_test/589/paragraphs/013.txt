The Board held that the applicant's delay in claiming refugee status was inconsistent with a subjective fear of persecution and found that the applicant did not have subjective fear of persecution. The Board concluded that the applicant had not discharged the burden of showing that he was persecuted and that he was not a Convention refugee, nor a "person in need of protection" according to paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the Act).
