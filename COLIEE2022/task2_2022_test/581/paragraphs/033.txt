Mr. Moin’s second argument involves his sur place refugee claim and the Board’s failure to deal with this argument in its reasons. In his written submissions to the Board, counsel for Mr. Moin submitted that by communicating directly with the alleged agents of persecution, the Canadian government has likely heightened the probability of harm to Mr. Moin if he returns to Pakistan. Yet, there is not even an allusion to this argument in the Board’s reasons. According to Mr. Moin, this would constitute another breach of natural justice.
