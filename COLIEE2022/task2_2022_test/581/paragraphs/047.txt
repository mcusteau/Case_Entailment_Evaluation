Finally, Mr. Moin challenged the Board’s assumption that he could have sought legal counsel in defending against the NAB’s allegations. Mr. Moin’s entire claim is based on the risk of persecution at the hands of the NAB. This is a government institution, and as such, the state is the alleged agent of persecution in this case. Accordingly, I do not think Mr. Moin is under the same burden as an ordinary claimant to displace the presumption of state protection. As Justice Danièle Tremblay-Lamer concluded in Chaves v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 193 at paragraph 15:
In my view, however, Ward, supra, and Kadenko, supra, cannot be interpreted to suggest that an individual will be required to exhaust all avenues before the presumption of state protection can be rebutted (see Sanchez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 536 (T.D.)(QL) and Peralta v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996), 123 F.T.R. 153 (F.C.T.D.)). Rather, where agents of the state are themselves the source of the persecution in question, and where the applicant’s credibility is not undermined, the applicant can successfully rebut the presumption of state protection without exhausting every conceivable recourse in the country. The very fact that the agents of the state are the alleged perpetrators of persecution undercuts the apparent democratic nature of the state’s institutions, and correspondingly, the burden of proof. As I explained in Molnar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] 2 F.C. 339 (T.D.), Kadenko, supra, has little application when the “[…] police not only refused to protect the applicants, but were also the perpetrators of the acts of violence”; Molnar, supra, at para. 19.
