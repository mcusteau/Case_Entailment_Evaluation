Mr. Moin indicated in his refugee intake interview that he was charged with corruption and misuse of public office, thereby raising the possibility of exclusion under Article 1(F)(b) of the Convention. Appropriate inquiries were made to determine whether he was excluded from the refugee definition. There is no evidence that authorities in Pakistan were advised Mr. Moin had made a claim for asylum. In any event, the disclosure was essential to determine if he fell within Article 1(F). I believe the following paragraph taken from the decision reached by Justice Donna McGillis in Igbinosun v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 1705 (F.C.T.D.) (QL), is a complete answer to Mr. Moin’s argument:
6. In the present case, the evidence establishes that the identity of the applicant was disclosed to Nigerian police officials to determine whether he had been charged with the offence of murder. There is no evidence to indicate that any confidential information given by the applicant in his personal information form was disclosed. The objection to the admissibility of the telex on the basis that the Privacy Act was violated has been advanced in the absence of a proper evidentiary framework and, as a result, must be rejected. Alternatively, even if Canadian officials did provide confidential information from the applicant to the Nigerian police, the disclosure was made for the purpose of permitting the Minister to formulate an opinion as to whether the claim of the applicant raised a matter within the exclusionary provision in subsection F(b) of Article 1 of the Convention. [See subparagraph 69.1(5)(a)(ii) of the Immigration Act.] Since the applicant provided the information for immigration purposes, its use, if any, by the Minister or his representatives was clearly “for a use consistent with that purpose” within the meaning of paragraph 8(2)(a) of the Privacy Act.
