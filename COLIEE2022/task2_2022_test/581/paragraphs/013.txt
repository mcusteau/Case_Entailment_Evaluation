The Canadian High Commission had originally looked into Mr. Moin’s case to see if there was any basis to exclude him from Convention refugee status under Article 1F(b) as a result of the NAB’s charges against him for corruption and misuse of public office. But since the NAB was apparently no longer investigating Mr. Moin, the Minister decided not to pursue that avenue.
