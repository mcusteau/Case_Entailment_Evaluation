In light of the foregoing, I agree with the Minister that the Board was not required to address Mr. Moinâ€™s arguments concerning his refugee sur place claim. A tribunal is not required to address such an argument where the applicant has been judged not to have presented any credible evidence substantiating his claim: Barry v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 203; Ghribi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1191; Lai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 179.
