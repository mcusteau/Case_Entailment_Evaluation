Be that as it may, I am not convinced Mr. Moin’s grievance is best characterized as an issue of bias. The Board member’s comment does not so much evince a closed mind but rather a misapprehension of the evidence. While she is absolutely right in stating that it is acceptable to compare the applicant’s NAB letters with other NAB documents, this is not the issue here. Had the Board been able to find NAB documents against which to compare Mr. Moin’s, her concerns could have been substantiated or put to rest. However, in the absence of anything specific regarding what NAB documentation looks like, it was not appropriate to rely exclusively on general documentary evidence to conclude the letters were forged.
