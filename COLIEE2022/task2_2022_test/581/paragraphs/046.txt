It might be reasonable to conclude a piece of evidence is not genuine if an applicantâ€™s story is generally not plausible, or where specific evidence demonstrates the document is not accurate. But here, the Board essentially rejected the NAB documents because the odds of their legitimacy were against Mr. Moin. Such reasoning would in effect make it virtually impossible for refugees of some countries to substantiate their claims with personal documentary evidence. In my opinion, such a finding is patently unreasonable.
