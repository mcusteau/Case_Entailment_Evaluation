The Board Member addressed this allegation of bias in her reasons. She wrote, at pages 5 and 6 of her decision:
Counsel states in his submissions that “a presumption that these documents are fraudulent undermines the foundation of the claimant’s need to seek protection and raises an apprehension of bias regarding the adjudication of his claim”. The panel determines that an adjudicator seeking an opportunity for a comparative review of any document does not constitute an absolute presumption that the document is fraudulent. On the contrary, it allows, on a balance of probabilities, the opportunity for the document to be deemed legitimate.
