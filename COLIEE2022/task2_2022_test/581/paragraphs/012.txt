The Board decided much of Mr. Moin’s testimony was not credible. It found no objective basis for his claim, and found it implausible that Mr. Marwat, 15 years after the fact and 12 years after Mr. Moin’s retirement, would risk bringing the rape story back into the public eye by arranging a false investigation against Mr. Moin. As a result, the Board determined that any investigation into Mr. Moin by the NAB was not motivated by his role as a police officer in the rape investigation, and that such an association was made in an effort to embellish his claim. It also found that someone in Mr. Moin’s senior position would have taken legal action to defend himself if wrongfully accused by the NAB. As such, the Board concluded he failed to rebut the presumption of state protection in Pakistan.
