Towards the end of the year for which the Minister's permit was granted, on July 22, 1992, the applicant sought an extension of that permit and of a work permit. There is a difference between the parties about the discussion which then took place, particularly about his marriage arrangements, but there is no debate that at that meeting he reported his passport had apparently been stolen, and that without a passport he was subject to report as a person not authorized to be in Canada. The applicant returned to the Immigration Centre on the following day, July 23, again seeking an extension of the Minister's permit and his work permit. He was again advised that without a passport his request could not be further considered because he was reportable under s. 27 of the
Act
. When he again returned two hours later with his passport he was advised that his case was under review by the officer who had met with him the previous day.
