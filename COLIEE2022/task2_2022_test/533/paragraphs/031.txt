[31]
I am not persuaded on the evidence before me that a case is made out that the applicant was unaware of the basic reservation or question of concern to the officer and that he did not have opportunity to respond to that concern before the decision not to extend the permit was granted. Moreover, I am not persuaded that had he brought forward any other evidence clearly supportive of his assertion that he and his wife were continuing to live together, even after he had been advised on July 31 that the permit would not be extended, that the representatives of the Minister concerned would not have reviewed the situation in light of that evidence. Had he done so before the letter of August 10 was sent, immigration officers concerned had the responsibility, in fairness to the applicant, to review the situation and that letter, confirming the decision not to extend the permit, might not have been sent if credible, objective evidence of their continuing to live together in their marriage, had been presented. Even if he had not done so until after that letter was received, the Department would have had opportunity to review his situation and had they not done so, positive evidence adduced by him to establish continuing cohabitation by himself and his wife would, at the least, have strengthened his case in relation to this application for judicial review, at least in relation to considerations affecting the exercise of the court's discretion in this matter.
