By her affidavit, the immigration officer, Teresa Jaworski, avers, in part, as follows:
"2. That I have read the affidavits of David Kagai and Suzanne Lavoie. I take exception to the statements made therein stating that David Kagai and Suzanne Lavoie have at all times lived together since their marriage and have at no time lived apart. I further take exception to the statement of David Kagai that I did not advise him of the basis for my belief that he and Suzanne Lavoie were no longer living together.
"3. David Kagai was issued a minister's permit on August 2, 1991, valid until August 1, 1992. On July 22, 1992, David Kagai attended at the Canada Immigration Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba to request an extension of his minister's permit. I advised David Kagai that I could not consider his request because he was not in possession of a passport and was reportable under s. 27 of the
Immigration Act
. I made notes of the interview with David Kagai wherein he advised that he was not living at the same address as his spouse. Attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'A' to this my affidavit is a copy of those notes ... The written notes were taken at the interview with David Kagai.

"5. On July 31, 1992 I set out in writing a synopsis of the case and my recommendation not to extend the minister's permit to the Manager of the Canada Immigration Centre. The Manager concurred with the decision which was communicated to the [sic] David Kagai verbally later on that day. Attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'C' to this my affidavit is a copy of those notes. ...
"6. When the decision not to extend the minister's permit was communicated to him on July 31, 1992, he was advised that we would not be continuing to process his case in Canada as he and his wife were no longer living together. I recall advising him that the basis for the decision was his admissions made to me on July 22, 1992 as well as information I received indicating that Suzanne Lavoie was moving to a new address with her friend Melita and no mention was made of David Kagai's name to Social Services. I [sic] not specifically recall if I discussed with David Kagai the other factors which are set out on the synopsis (see Exhibit 'D'). He was advised that he would be receiving a letter to this effect. Attached hereto and marked as Exhibit 'E' to this my affidavit is a copy of the notes taken at the July 31, 1992 meeting with David Kagai. ..."
