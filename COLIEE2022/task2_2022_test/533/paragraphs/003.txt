The issue raised by this application concerns the fairness of the process followed by representatives of the respondent Minister leading to the decision here in question which was contained in a letter addressed to the applicant from R. Gushuliak dated August 10, 1992. That letter, so far as it is relevant here, stated as follows:
"This letter refers to your Immigration status in Canada. On August 2, 1991, you were issued a Minister's Permit valid until August 1, 1992. This permit was issued to allow you to remain in Canada while your application for permanent residence in Canada was being processed. This application was supported by an Undertaking of Assistance submitted by your wife, Suzanne Lavoie. This office agreed to process your application for permanent residence from within Canada to allow you and your wife to remain together.
"We have now received information indicating that you and your wife are no longer living together. This development has removed any humanitarian and compassionate grounds that warranted seeking a visa exemption on your behalf. It is the Commission's opinion that you entered into this marriage for the sole purpose of gaining permanent residence in Canada, and not for the purpose of residing permanently with your spouse, as per Immigration Regulation 4(3).
"This letter will serve as written notice that the Minister's Permit which was issued to you on August 2, 1991 will not be extended and we are requesting that your [sic] depart Canada by August 28, 1992. If you remain in Canada past that date you will face enforcement action which may include a Ministerial deportation order. ..."
