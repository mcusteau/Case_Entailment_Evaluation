As I view the evidence in this case, the following key circumstances seem clear to me.
1) The applicant must have been aware from the time the original Minister's permit was granted to him in August 1991 that the basis for that permit was his marriage to a Canadian citizen who had undertaken to sponsor him for permanent residence in Canada, and that the permit allowed him to make application for permanent residence from within Canada so that he and his wife would not be separated as a result of his having to leave the country, which he otherwise would have been required to do.
2) At the time of the meeting on July 22, 1992, when the applicant sought an extension of the Minister's permit he must have been aware from the questions asked about where he and his wife were living at the time, that there were serious questions concerning whether or not they were living together as husband and wife, the key circumstance which was the basis for the Minister's permit. The questions put to him were simple and straightforward. They included the question "why you not living with your wife". Apparently he did not then respond in any way that disabused Ms. Jaworski of her concern that Kagai and his wife were living apart, and in his later examination does not indicate any other response other than to deny they were living apart.
3) If not from the meeting of July 22, then at the meeting of July 31 the applicant was aware that the Department had information from other sources that he and his wife were no longer living together.
4) At no time, at the meeting on July 22 or in the following week before the officer made her report on July 31, at the meeting on July 31 or thereafter before receipt of the letter confirming the decision not to extend the permit, or after that letter up to the time of his own letter of August 27 requesting that the matter be reviewed, or thereafter, did the applicant bring forward any evidence, other than his affidavit and that of his wife filed in relation to the application for leave to commence these proceedings, of the arrangements for his marriage. Rather than bring forward any evidence that would support the situation described in the affidavits of himself and his wife that they were continuing to live together, evidence which in my view ought not to have been difficult for the applicant to provide, he relies simply on his own statements and that of his wife. So far as there was evidence before the officer, including his own statements of their living arrangements at different addresses made at the meeting on July 22, the applicant in his examination simply denies that he made certain statements, and denies that the officer made statements indicating serious reservations about the continuing marriage relationship.
