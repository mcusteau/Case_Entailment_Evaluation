In my view the questions asked by Ms. Jaworski, which in his examination he acknowledged as having been asked, were simple and straightforward. He acknowledges, as well, having given the officer information recorded as answers to the questions asked, though he denied that he did so in relation to the specific questions, and he denied having indicated that he lived at a different address than his wife. Yet he must have been aware that continued living together with his wife in their marriage had been the principle factor in the grant of the original permit, and that it would be just as significant in any extension or renewal of the permit. Knowing this, it was surely his own responsibility at the July 22 meeting to ensure that evidence of his continuing to live with his wife, if that were required by the officer, would be provided.
