After receiving the letter of August 10, 1992, the applicant wrote to the Canadian Immigration Centre on August 27, in part in the following terms:
"On the 14th of August, 1992, I received a request to leave the country in 14 days for allegedly marrying for the sole purpose of gaining landed immigrant status. The officer who accused me is Teressa Jowoski [sic]. I do wish to bring to your attention that the above officer never gave me a chance to defend myself neither did she listen to my explanation. I feel that she accused, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced me regardless of the truth. As a result, she refused to renew my minister's permit as well as my work permit. She further refused to give me permission to attend school, yet, I had paid for my admission fee already.
"The accusations are totally untrue and I am still actively married to my wife Suzanne Lavoie and we have one child. I had no choice but to seek legal council [sic] after I received a departure notice. I do wish to inform you that I have instructed my lawyer to file an appeal through the Federal Court. ...
"I am informally requesting that you kindly review my case ..."
