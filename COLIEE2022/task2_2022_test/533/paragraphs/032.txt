[32]
I accept that the officer's decision not to extend the Minister's permit was made with approval of her superior on July 31 prior to her meeting that day with the applicant. Yet that followed the meeting on July 22 when the officer believed that Mr. Kagai had acknowledged he and his wife were living apart. While he denies acknowledging that, he could not have been unaware of the officer's concern or serious question about that issue. He did nothing to seek to establish that he and his wife were living together, except to deny that they were living apart, either then or at any subsequent time before or after the decision was communicated to him by Ms. Jaworski on July 31, or before or after the decision was confirmed by the letter of August 10, 1992. In my view he knew of the serious question the officer had about the continuing marriage arrangements and he had ample opportunity to respond to that serious question both before and after the letter of August 10, 1992, confirming that the Minister's permit would not be extended and he was required to leave Canada.
