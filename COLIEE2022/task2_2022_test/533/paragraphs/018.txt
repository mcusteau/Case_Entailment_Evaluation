On behalf of the applicant, it is urged that the fairness principle dictates, in the case where an applicant seeks extension or renewal of a Minister's permit, as in the case where a permit is cancelled, that objections to extending or renewing the permit and an opportunity to respond to those should be provided before the decision is made. The same procedure ought to apply, it is said, when a decision is to be made concerning extension, renewal or cancellation of a Minister's permit. Here it is urged that the letter of August 10, 1992, simply conveyed the decision that the Minister's permit would not be renewed because it was concluded the applicant's marriage had been entered into solely for the purpose of gaining permanent residence in Canada, referring to information received that the applicant and his wife were no longer living together, without specifics of that information and without offering an opportunity to respond to the Department's concerns.
