Although the plaintiffs' role in prosecuting this contempt proceeding serves to protect the integrity of the order issued by the court, a balance should be struck, in awarding costs, between this public interest and the plaintiffs' private interest in the litigation. In this action, the plaintiffs sought to protect the reputation of their trademarks. In my view, these dual interests should be kept in mind in assessing "the public interest in having the proceeding litigated", pursuant to rule 400(3)(h) and in the determination of reasonable costs.
