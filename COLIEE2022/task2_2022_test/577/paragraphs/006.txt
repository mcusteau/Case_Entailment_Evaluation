In this proceeding, the defendants obtained the dismissal of the action and the dissolution of the injunction prior to the hearing concerning the show cause order. Neither party suggested this would provide a defence to the contempt citation. However, in
Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canadian Liberty Net et al.
, [1996] 1 F.C. 787; 192 N.R. 313 (F.C.A.), affd. [1998] 1 S.C.R. 626; 224 N.R. 241, at p. 801, Justice Linden noted for the majority that:
"The most important mitigating matter to consider is that the order violated has been found by this court to be invalid. Such an order is certainly not of the type where dire consequences should result from its violation."
In adopting this statement and applying other mitigating principles in sentencing, I agree with the parties that Mr. Pardhan ought not to be sentenced to a period of imprisonment for conduct which would have been legal were it not in breach of an order of this court.
