While I do not think the choice of standard here will affect the outcome, I will apply the standard of reasonableness. I agree with the analysis which has been done in numerous cases in recent years in this Court (see, for example, Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Fu, [2004] F.C.J. No. 88, Chen v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2004] F.C.J. No. 2069)) that the correct standard is that of reasonableness. This conclusion follows from the fact that there is no privative clause, but that citizenship judges acquire a certain expertise in these residence cases and the issue before the reviewing court is essentially one of mixed fact and law. I believe that is true in this case.
