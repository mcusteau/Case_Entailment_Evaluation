The decision of the citizenship judge is not without ambiguity. Under the heading "Has the applicant met the residency requirement of 1095 days in Canada?" the following paragraph appears:
In his application for citizenship, Mr. Farshchi stated that during the relevant four year period he was out of Canada 405 days, leaving him with 1055 days in Canada. This is 40 days short of what is required by the Citizenship Act. While I may consider this a minor shortage and overlook the requirement of the Citizenship Act, I need to be convinced that indeed Mr. Farshchi was in Canada 1055 days during the relevant period and that he has demonstrated an ongoing presence in Canada.
