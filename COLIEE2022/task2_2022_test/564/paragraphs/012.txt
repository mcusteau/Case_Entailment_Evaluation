The Applicant complains that by the Respondent's processes for filing an application for citizenship, and through the actions of the citizenship judge, he was asked to provide information which would have been relevant in applying the "normally resident" or Koo test. He says that either the citizenship judge was, by having this information, mixing the two tests or that somehow he was the victim of some unfairness by being misled as to which test was being used. Much of this application information is no doubt collected by the Respondent for various purposes. As for the proceedings before the citizenship judge, the law clearly recognizes that the citizenship judge can choose which test to use after having examined the evidence: see, for example, Tulupnikov [2006] F.C.J. No. 1807 at paras. [17] - [18]. I cannot see how this resulted in any unfairness to the Applicant in the present case. The Applicant's real complaint seems to be that the citizenship judge did not find his evidence probative on a balance of probabilities.
