The third exchange is as follows:
"Counsel: How long ago was the last visit of the guerillas to your house?
"Claimant: [in Spanish, not interpreted]
"Ms. Grice: Mr. Cohen, that's a confusing question. Do you mean the last time they came when the incident occurred or the last time they came when the group of five [inaudible]?
"Counsel: I'll ask the question again. Not counting the incident that happened at your house, when is the last time, or, how long ago was the last time that the guerillas came to your house?
"Claimant: It was in December when they came the last time, looking for me.
"Counsel: December of which year?
"Claimant: December of 1993.
"Counsel: Okay, we're in 1993 now.
"Mr. Townshend:
Counsel, I'm going to interrupt you now. It's pretty obvious. You keep on asking him the same question over and over and over again
.
"Counsel: It's not the same question.
"Mr. Townshend: Well, I'm saying, it was already answered to the panel member. He answered me that the five visits, five or so visits occurred shortly after he was released from the army and they occurred in 1983. That answer amply covers the question you're asking him. If you keep on asking it you're going to get December 1993, or, as he has previously answered, 1994. I don't understand how that's going to assist us in understanding it.
"Counsel: If I may, Mr. Townshend, it's clear that the claimant has difficulty with, it appears to me that the claimant has difficulty with counting and with knowing years, so I'm trying to determine in terms of the length of time that has elapsed when the last visit to his house was by the guerillas.
"Mr. Townshend:
I give you my caution. You can proceed at your own peril, counsel
.
"Ms. Grice: I think, counsel,
the panel understands that this was ten years ago, and this young man was thirteen years old. I think we all have to bear that in mind, including his counsel
.
"Counsel: I would like to ask one more question in that regard. How old were you when the guerillas last came to your house, not counting the incident of January of this year?
"Claimant: You mean this year?
"Counsel: I don't know. That's what I'm asking you.
"Claimant: I don't understand any question whatsoever. I'm completely numb.
"Counsel: Okay, well let's leave that, then."
