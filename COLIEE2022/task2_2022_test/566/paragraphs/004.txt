With respect to the issue of bias, counsel for the applicant submitted that the conduct of the Board, evidenced in three exchanges recorded in the transcript of the hearing, taken singly and cumulatively gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Counsel for the applicant alleges that these exchanges took place on an issue which was central to the applicant's claim.
