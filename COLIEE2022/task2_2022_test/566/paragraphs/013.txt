From a review of the record I cannot conclude in the case at bar that the applicant was prevented from presenting his evidence by the interventions noted above. I have also come to the conclusion that in the case at bar the Board member's behaviour did not demonstrate that he had in one way or the other prejudged the applicant's case, even though his questioning was at some points abrupt and insensitive. I am of the opinion that the test laid out in the
Committee for Justice and Liberty Foundation et al. v. National Energy Board et al.
cited above, has not been satisfied.
