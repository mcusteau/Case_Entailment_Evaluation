There are two other decisions of this Court dealing with a decision of the Refugee Division which are of assistance. The first is
Mahendran v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 134 N.R. 316; 14 Imm. L.R.(2d) 30 (C.A.) where Mr. Justice Heald noted that the examination by the Refugee Hearing Officer accounted for some 52 pages while the Board Member cross-examined the applicant for some 70 pages, the object being to impeach the applicant's credibility. Mr. Justice Heald stated:
"... one can perhaps have some understanding for Tribunal members who, in their enthusiasm to perform their duties in a creditable fashion, may sometimes create a perception of over-aggressiveness and unfairness. However, for the reasons given herein, I conclude that the conduct of the Tribunal members sought to be impeached does not offend the principles set out in the
Committee for Justice and Liberty
case, supra."
