I agree with counsel for the respondent that the interventions by the presiding member as recorded in the transcript of the hearing demonstrate a regrettable lack of sensitivity to the applicant's lack of sophistication. What I am called upon to decide is if the record demonstrates a reasonable apprehension of bias. The applicable test for determining whether a reasonable apprehension of bias exists in the circumstance of a particular case is that set out in the case of
Committee for Justice & Liberty Foundation et al. v. National Energy Board et al.
, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369; 9 N.R. 115. The test is:
"'[W]hat would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the Tribunal here], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly?'"
