The applicant claims that the Board in concluding that he was not persecuted on a defined ground made an erroneous finding of fact or misconstrued the applicant's evidence. In its decision the Board noted that in order to be considered a Convention refugee, a person must show a well founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. In its conclusion the Board stated that after careful consideration of all the evidence adduced at the hearing, "the panel is not persuaded that there is a reasonable chance or a serious possibility that the claimant faces persecution by reason of any of the grounds set out in the Convention refugee definition".
