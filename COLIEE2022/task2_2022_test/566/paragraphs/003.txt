At the hearing counsel for the applicant raised two issues:
1. Did the Board's conduct during the hearing give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias?
2. Did the Board err in law in concluding that there is no credible or trustworthy evidence of a nexus or link between the persecution feared by the applicant and a ground set out in the definition of a Convention refugee and is this conclusion of the Board based upon erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner without regard for the material it (sic) or upon errors in law?
