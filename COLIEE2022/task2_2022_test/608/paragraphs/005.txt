The affidavit of Alannah Herbert, Expulsions Officer at the Greater Toronto Enforcement Centre in Mississauga, Ontario was filed by the respondent. Ms. Herbert attests that at no time during her carriage of the applicant's removal proceedings did the applicant submit a request for a deferral of removal. No evidence of such a request has been filed in these proceedings. The applicant made his own flight arrangements for a return to India on December 31, 2004 and accordingly, a new Direction to Report for that departure date has been issued. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, I conclude that there is no underlying decision to be reviewed and the application for leave and for judicial review has no arguable chance of success.
