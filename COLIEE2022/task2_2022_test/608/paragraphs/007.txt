The evidence before me indicates that there were no submissions made or information conveyed to the removals officer with respect to the best interests of the applicant's Canadian-born child before or after the issuance of the Direction to Report on December 21st and the new Direction to Report on December 31st. Accordingly, there was no basis upon which the officer could properly consider the child's interests. The applicant argues that the officer "must have been aware" of the child's existence and should have actively taken steps to acquire more information. In my view, the onus to inform the officer rested on the applicant and having done nothing to satisfy that onus he can not now complain that she failed to consider the child's best interests.
