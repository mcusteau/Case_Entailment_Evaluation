The applicant made an unsuccessful claim for refugee status in 1993 upon the expiry of his visitor's visa. His application for leave for judicial review of that decision was denied. He has made three H & C applications; the second was the subject of an unsuccessful judicial review application. His pre-removal risk assessment was negative. The balance of convenience in this case does not favour the applicant. Accordingly, this application will be dismissed.
