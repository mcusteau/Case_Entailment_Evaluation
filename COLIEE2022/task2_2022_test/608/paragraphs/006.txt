The applicant argues that the Court should exercise its discretion to grant a stay because the best interests of his Canadian born child were not taken into account in making the decision to remove the applicant, and irreparable harm will result to the child. The removals officer has only a limited degree of discretion to defer removal: Simoes v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 187 F.T.R. 219 (T.D.). However, an officer is obliged to give some consideration to a Canadian-born child's best interests: Harry v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 195 F.T.R. 221 (T.D.).
