I agree with the submission of counsel for the defendant that the learned prothonotary proceeded on a wrong principle in striking the defendant's counterclaim on the ground that it failed to prove facts from which it could be concluded that damage "surely" resulted. Sufficiency of pleading is one thing, proof at trial of the material facts so pleaded is another. I am also of the view that the learned prothonotary completely misapprehended the facts regarding the sufficiency of the allegations of general damages for loss of business and reputation and the naming of the customers of the defendant to whom the false or misleading statements were made.
