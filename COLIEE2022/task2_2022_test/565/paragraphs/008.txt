In S. & S. Industries Inc. v. Rowell, [1966] S.C.R. 419, Martland, J., said at pp. 424-425:
"The combined effect of ss. 7(a) and 52 [now s. 53] of the Trade Marks Act is to create a statutory cause of action for which damages may be awarded if a person is damaged by false or misleading statements by a competitor tending to discredit the claimant's business, wares or services. The essential elements of such an action are:
1. A false or misleading statement;
2. Tending to discredit the business, wares or services of a competitor; and
3. Resulting damage.
"There is no express requirement that the false or misleading statements be made with knowledge of their falsity, or that they be made maliciously.
. . . . .
"In my opinion, the natural meaning of s. 7(a) is to give a cause of action, in the specified circumstances, in respect of statements which are, in fact, false, and the presence or absence of malice would only have relevance in relation to the assessment of damages."
