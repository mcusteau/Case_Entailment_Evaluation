I would make only one further comment. Although not stated, it seems apparent on the facts that the motion to strike fell to be determined under rule 419(1)(a) by reason of the plaintiff having pleaded over and its long delay in launching the motion. Actually, the delay of some four years in bringing on the motion to strike smacks of being downright cavalier, if not oppressive. In any event, a pleading will only be struck on summary motion under rule 419(1)(a) where it is plain and obvious beyond doubt that the case raised by the pleading is incapable of success. Moreover, a pleading should not be struck where the other party has pleaded over or where there has been a lengthy delay between delivery of the pleading and the bringing of the motion to strike. See Waterside Ocean Navigation Co. v. International Navigation Ltd., [1977] 2 F.C. 257 (T.D.); Vulcan Equipment Co. Ltd. v. Coats Co. Inc., [1982] 2 F.C. 77; 39 N.R. 518 (C.A.); A.G. Can. v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735; 33 N.R. 304; 115 D.L.R.(3d) 1; and Nabisco Brands Ltd. v. Procter & Gamble Co. (1985), 62 N.R. 364; 5 C.P.R.(3d) 417 (F.C.A.).
