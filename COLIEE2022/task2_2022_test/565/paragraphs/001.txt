McNair, J.
: This is an appeal of the defendant and plaintiff by counterclaim, Senstar Corporation, from the decision of the Associate Senior Prothonotary made on July 13, 1988, wherein he struck paragraphs 20, 22(d) and 22(e) of the defendant's amended statement of defence and counterclaim under rule 419 of the Federal Court Rules on the ground that the allegations pleaded therein did not disclose a reasonable cause of action within the meaning of s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act. The grounds of appeal are that the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in law and in fact by sustaining the plaintiff's motion to strike, particularly with respect to the following:
(a) erred in fact and in law in finding that the pleading of the defendant (plaintiff by counterclaim) failed to disclose a cause of action;
(b) erred in finding that the requirements for pleading damages under s. 7(a) of the Trade Marks Act are different from those under any other section of the Trade Marks Act;
(c) erred in fact in finding that the defendant had failed to plead general damages when such damages were in fact specifically pleaded in paragraph 20;
(d) erred in law in finding, on an application to strike a pleading under rule 419, that there must be "proof of facts from which it can be concluded that damage 'surely' resulted" if the pleading is to be maintained.
