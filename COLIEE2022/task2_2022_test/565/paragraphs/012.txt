In Ratcliffe v. Evans, [1892] 2 Q.B. 524 (C.A.), Bowen, L.J., in discussing the damage done by a trade libel, said at p. 529:
"If, indeed, over and above this general damage, further particular damage is under the circumstances to be relied on by the plaintiff, such particular damage must of course be alleged and shewn. But a loss of general custom, flowing directly and in the ordinary course of things from a libel, may be alleged and proved generally. 'It is not special damage' -- says Pollock, C.B., in Harrison v. Pearce [32 L.T. (O.S.) 298] -- 'it is general damage resulting from the kind of injury the plaintiff has sustained'."
