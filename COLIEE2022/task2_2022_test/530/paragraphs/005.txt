The principal applicant had voluntarily joined the Minister of Defence in October 1982. He began working as an administrative soldier responsible, amongst other duties, for the transmission of orders to security officials to mount surveillance on dissidents. He found the work unsatisfactory for he did not like to be in a position of passing on orders that resulted in difficulties for others and he requested, and was granted, a transfer to the Ministry of the Interior on October 1, 1983. There he signed an agreement to work for a two year period and he worked at a police station as a driver responsible for driving officers to meetings and transporting detainees. After experiencing some trouble with his superiors in connection with the electoral campaign for a return of democracy, he was transferred upon a friend's request in January 1985, to work at the police hospital in an administrative position and as a driver. He had no problems at the hospital until April 1989, when the authorities began to harass him for signing a referendum against the Impunity Law. He then requested a discharge from the forces in mid-April 1989 and in February 1990, but was denied both times. He remained at the hospital until he and his wife left the country in May 1991.
