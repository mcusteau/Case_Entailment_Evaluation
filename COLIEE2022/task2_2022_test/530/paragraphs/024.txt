After reviewing the PIF and the transcript of his oral hearing, in my opinion, there was evidence before the panel upon which it could reasonably conclude that "there were serious reasons for considering that the principal applicant was a knowing and personal participant in certain persecutorial acts amounting to a crime against humanity". It found that (1) he was "a member of a military force, one of whose common objectives was the torture of prisoners to extract information"; (2) he was a "personal and knowing participant" in persecutorial acts by transporting detainees to "clandestine detention centres" and in one incident, transporting what he believed was a corpse, and he was one who, though of low rank, was aware that his work involved secret activity which lead to persecution of individuals, though admittedly that knowledge "weighed on his mind"; and (3) he could have, but did not, distance himself from the organization at the earliest opportunity.
