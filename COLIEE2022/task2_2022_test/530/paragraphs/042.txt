To summarize, I conclude on the first issue that the tribunal did not err in the formulation of the test, nor in its application, in determining that the applicant was complicit in a crime against humanity. In this case, it was reasonably open to the tribunal, from the oral and written evidence of the applicants, to conclude there were "serious reasons for considering" that the claimant has committed an international offence. Regardless of the particular terminology used by the tribunal in relation to complicity, its reasons adequately identified the acts in which it reasonably concluded that the principal applicant was a "knowing and personal participant". There was evidence, mainly from the principal applicant himself, that he voluntarily joined the organization and remained a member for nine years, he had knowledge that secret persecution of prisoners was "a continuous and regular part of the operation", he was physically present and had participated by assisting those involved in committing international offences, and had not disassociated himself from the organization at the earliest opportunity. On the second issue, I conclude that it was not an error for the tribunal to consider the application of the exclusion clause to the principal applicant without making an explicit finding in regard to the merits of inclusion, that is, on the merits of his claim aside from the exclusion under Article 1 F(a). Finally, on the third issue, the tribunal considered the evidence, including relevant evidence of the principal applicant, concerning the wife's dependent claim to refugee status, and it negatively assessed her credibility in determining that she was also not a Convention refugee. That conclusion, in my view, was not based on any reviewable error.
