In this case the applicants urged that in finding the principal applicant to have been a "personal and knowing participant", the Refugee Division erred in law by misconstruing the evidence before them. It is urged that the principal applicant had never been physically present to directly witness any incidents of persecution and that he did not share a common purpose with the military forces, that while he voluntarily joined the armed forces as a government employee in 1982 it was for purely financial reasons, that his knowledge of the commission of any international crimes was limited to second hand information and his relationship to the organization, having been continually persecuted and disciplined by the authorities, was in the nature of being adversarial. The fact that the principal applicant did not desert the forces until early in 1991 is said to be irrelevant because there was a significant change in April 1985 so that thereafter the country was under a civilian democratic government. For all these reasons, his connection to the commission of international offences was said to be too tenuous to be characterized as "personal and knowing participation".
