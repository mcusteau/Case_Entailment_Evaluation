It appears unnecessary to make an assessment of the merits of the principal applicant's claim in every case where it is determined the applicant is excluded by reason of Article 1 F(a), as a prelude to considering a claim dependent upon that of the principal applicant. It is sufficient if the tribunal assesses the dependent claim on its own merits, taking into account the circumstances on which the principal claim was based. In
Penate
, supra, counsel for the applicants made the same argument as was here advanced. Madame Justice Reed found that the approach taken by the tribunal in assessing the spousal claim fully met the concerns expressed by the Court of Appeal in
Moreno
. She stated at pp. 11-12:
"... The wife's claim was assessed independently but by reference to the factual situations which her husband had asserted in his claim. The dependent claim was assessed on its own merits. The circumstances on which the principal claim was based were taken into account in doing so. I do not think the panel committed any error of law in proceeding as it did."
