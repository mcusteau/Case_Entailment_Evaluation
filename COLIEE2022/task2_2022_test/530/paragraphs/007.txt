In his PIF, he mentioned that while serving as a driver at the Ministry of Interior he had witnessed the officers beating the detainees while arresting and transporting them, and that he had transported "people who were badly hurt and in need of medical attention from the police station to clandestine detention centres" instead of a hospital. In one particular incident on August 24, 1984, two police officers loaded a package containing what the applicant believed to be a body into his van and ordered him to drive to a desolated military property in the outskirts of Montevideo. Upon arrival there, the officers told him to wait in the van, then they unloaded the van and returned after about an hour. On their trip back to the station, the applicant asked the officers what had happened to the man. The officers laughed and said that someone had gotten carried away during interrogation. The applicant did not say anything further at that time but the next day he spoke to his supervisor about the matter. He was told to forget about the incident for his own good. Later that same day, the officers confronted him and told him to be very careful of what he said or he would also end up at the place where they had disposed of the package from his van.
