Counsel for the applicants submitted that having determined that the principal applicant was excluded under Article 1 F(a) without considering the issue of inclusion, the panel then erred by assessing the wife's dependent claim on the basis of persecution directed against her personally. It is said to have failed to consider that harassment and persecution of family members may give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution, and that the tribunal ignored evidence of systematic persecution which supported the principal applicant's well-founded fear of persecution and the wife's testimonial evidence that she opened the door for two officers threatening them in their home in 1985, and that she had collected signatures for the referendum along with her husband in 1989.
