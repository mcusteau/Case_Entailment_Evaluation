In argument, counsel for the principal applicant urged that the tribunal ought to have considered the comparatively tenuous involvement of the applicant in any international offences with the serious persecution he would face if he were returned to his home country. The balancing of those factors was rejected specifically by Mahoney, J.A., in
Gonzalez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, supra, note 2, at p. 8 of unreported reasons. I note that in written arguments, the applicant urged that failure to balance these factors constitutes a violation of s. 12
Charter
rights, but that argument was not pursued when this matter was heard.
