I disagree with the respondents' assertions. I am of the opinion that the petition to the Minister constitutes the premature course of action and not the application for judicial review and a writ of quo warranto in the present matter. As previously mentioned, the NHCN Band Council is a federal board under the definition of section 18 of the
Act
. If the applicant wished to challenge the decisions taken by that board, it should have done so in this Court first as opposed to asking the Minister for assistance by means of a petition.
