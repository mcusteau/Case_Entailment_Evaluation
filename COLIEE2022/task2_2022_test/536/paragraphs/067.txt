The Supreme Court of Canada in
Québec (Ministre de la Justice) v. Therrien, J.
, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 3; 270 N.R. 1, commented on the basic elements associated with procedural fairness. That is, the right to be heard and the right to an impartial hearing. At paragraph 82, the Court said:
"Essentially, the duty to act fairly has two components: the right to be heard (the audi alteram partem rule) and the right to an impartial hearing (the nemo judex in sua causa rule). The nature and extent of the duty may vary with the specific context and the various fact situations dealt with by the administrative body, as well as the nature of the disputes it must resolve:
