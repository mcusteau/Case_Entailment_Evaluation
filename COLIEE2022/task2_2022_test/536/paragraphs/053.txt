In
Old St. Boniface Residents Association Inc. v. Winnipeg (City) et al.
, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1170; 116 N.R. 46; 69 Man.R.(2d) 134; 75 D.L.R.(4th) 385, the Supreme Court outlined a test to be used in illustrating that Municipal Council decisions were pre-determined and therefore not in the best interests of the residents. Justice Romilly, in
Assu
, above, adopts the same test for illustrating that Band Council decisions are predetermined and therefore not in the best interests of Band members. In
Old St. Boniface
, the Supreme Court says the following regarding the aforementioned test:
"In my opinion, the test that is consistent with the functions of a municipal councillor and enables him or her to carry out the political and legislative duties entrusted to the councillor is one which requires that the objectors or supporters be heard by members of council who are capable of being persuaded. The legislature could not have intended to have a hearing before a body who has already made a decision which is irreversible. The party alleging disqualifying bias must establish that there is a prejudgment of the matter, in fact, to the extent that any representations at variance with the view, which has been adopted, would be futile. [...] In this regard it is important to keep in mind that support in favour of a measure before a committee and a vote in favour will not constitute disqualifying bias in the absence of some indication that the position taken is incapable of change. The contrary conclusion would result in the disqualification of a majority of council in respect of all matters that are decided at public meetings at which objectors are entitled to be heard."
