On January 23, 1998, the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (the Minister) issued an order to exclude the NHCN from the electoral provisions of the
Indian Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5 (
Indian Act
). As such, the NHCN became a "custom band" and the
Indian Council Regulations
under the
Indian Act
no longer applied to the NHCN Council meetings. The NHCN Chief and Council adopted a replacement for the said
Regulations
, being the
NHCN Policy and Procedural Guidelines Manual
(the
Guidelines
). The Norway House election code also referred to as the
Election Procedures Act
is part of the said guidelines.
