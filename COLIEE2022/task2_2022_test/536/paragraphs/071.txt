The actions taken by the Band Council have serious consequences for the applicant. Further, the reasons noted by the Band Council to take such actions are completely unfounded. The respondent Muswagon acknowledged that the applicant's honorarium was reduced for purportedly acting to discredit the efforts made by the Chief and Band Council. It was made clear to the applicant that such a decision could have been reversed if he had just complied with the Chief's wishes and was not openly critical of the Band Council's actions (see the minutes of the NHCN Band Council meeting at page 15, Tab M of the applicant's record, volume III). This is a clear indication of influence peddling and blackmail directed towards the applicant. The respondents clearly acted in bad faith, and have not justified their actions with any valid reasons.The respondents have breached duties of procedural fairness by not providing valid notification and reasons for the reduction in the applicant's honorarium and responsibilities. Further, even though valid reasons were not provided, the applicant should have still been given an opportunity, to respond to the actions taken against him. In not providing this opportunity the respondents breached a duty of procedural fairness.
