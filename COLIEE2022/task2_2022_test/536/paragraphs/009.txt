Prior to beginning my analysis, I would like to stress two specific events which occurred regarding the present matter. On March 14, 2002, after a Band Council election, the three re-elected respondent parties, Muskego, Muswagon and Clarke together with the re-elected respondent party Evans met with the three defeated councillors at a special Council meeting. At this meeting the aforementioned group of individuals purported in the name of the NHCN Band Council to award a four year job to a defeated councillor. Clearly, those members did not respect the outcome of the election and attempted to reinstate a losing candidate into his former job by awarding him a contract for the duration of an elected Band councillor's four year mandate. Upon my analysis of the evidence, this is but one example among many, in which members of the NHCN Band Council have failed to respect the notion of representative democracy regarding their activities. When a Band Council fails to respect the results of an election, or attempts to circumvent the outcome of an election, then democracy is at risk.
