The applicant submits that between March 5, 2002 and November 2, 2004, there were approximately 56 officially-scheduled meetings as required by article 11.1 of the NHCN
Guidelines
. However, the applicant mentions that only 16 of these meetings actually took place in the form prescribed by the guidelines. As such, he argues that the councillors have each vacated their office because they have missed three consecutive duly constituted regularly scheduled meetings of the Band Council without being excused. Article 9.1(e) of the NHCN
Election Procedures Act
outlines the criteria of what constitutes a vacated position:
"9.1 The office of Chief or Councillor becomes vacant when a person who holds that office:
e) Fails to attend three (3) consecutive
duly constituted Council meetings
without being excused from attendance by a quorum of Council." (my emphasis)
