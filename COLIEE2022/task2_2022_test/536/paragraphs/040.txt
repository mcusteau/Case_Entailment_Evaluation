Regarding municipalities, regular scheduled meetings can be cancelled if, upon the opening of a meeting, the chairperson or secretary realizes that a quorum of members is not in attendance. Such a process should be the norm for the cancellation of Band Council meetings. Band Council meetings should not be cancelled as a result of a decision taken by the Chief or as a result of a resolution of the quorum of council prepared in advance of the scheduled meeting. There are no doubt exceptions to be made periodically for valid reasons; however, the systematic cancellation of two thirds of the regular scheduled meetings is totally unacceptable. Between March 5, 2002 and November 2, 2004, there were approximately 56 officially-scheduled meetings that were required to be attended and convened by the councillors and Chief. However, only 16 of these meetings were duly constituted. Such a situation goes against the spirit and the wording of the rules. Further, the systematic cancellation of meetings makes it exceedingly difficult for the members of the Band to participate in the process.
