Pursuant to articles 10.1 to 10.11 of the NHCN
Guidelines
, a councillor must first be suspended from his or her duties before the optional suspension of an honorarium can be considered. However, in the present matter, it would seem that the Band Council did not follow their own procedure in order to reduce the Band councillor's honorarium. This was evident in the fact that he was not actually suspended before his honorarium was reduced. I find that the applicant, at the very least, could have expected that the Band's policy for the suspension of a councillor's honorarium would have been followed. Therefore, in ignoring their own processes in a manner that suggests a lack of good faith, the respondents breached a duty of procedural fairness (see
Ross v. Mohawk Council of Kanesatake
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 683; 232 F.T.R. 238 (T.D.), at paragraph 95).
