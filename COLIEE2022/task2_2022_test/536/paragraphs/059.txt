I find that the resolution should not have been submitted into the Court of Queen's Bench in Thompson, Manitoba, as evidence of an official decision of the respondent Band Council because it had yet to be passed by the Band Council. Further, the resolution presented to be passed on April 1, 2004, was in fact a predetermined matter. Councillors were not given a chance to debate or discuss the resolution. Further, copies of the resolution, agreed to in secret by only three council members, were not provided to the councillors for review. It is clear that the matter had been pre-determined. As such, I find that the resolution which was allegedly passed on April 1, 2004, is void.
