I would like to emphasize that the ratification process mentioned by the respondents is a myth. Resolutions cannot be adopted in secret meetings, and then subsequently ratified at a duly convened meeting without being discussed and debated. The resolution itself must be passed at a duly convened meeting. It cannot be the product of a secret meeting and subsequently rubber stamped at a later date at a duly convened meeting. Resolutions cannot be the product of predetermined decisions. They must be debated and passed in accordance with the rules and guidelines of the Band and in accordance to the principles of democracy. In the present matter, there are many examples which illustrate that the ratification process of Band Council resolutions was inherently biased. I will now turn my attention to one such example.
4. Should the Band Council resolution dated March 17, 2004 be declared void?
