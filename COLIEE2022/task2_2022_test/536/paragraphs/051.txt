Not only does the exercise of conferred Band Council powers need to be in conformity with subsection 2(3) of the
Indian Act
, it also must be in the best interest and for the protection of the Band members. Justice Blair goes on to equate a failure to respect the criteria of subsection 2(3) of the
Indian Act
as a breach of a fiduciary and trust obligation owed to the Band Council members by stating the following at paragraphs 88 and 91:
"There is a paucity of evidence upon which I might be so satisfied. There are no minutes or records of a meeting of the Band council which could lead me to conclude that a meeting had been duly convened as required by the
Act
. There are no Band council resolutions which could lead me to conclude that a majority of the councillors of the Band had consented to the severance and the payment.
. . . . .
"In summary, the defendant failed to appreciate in any meaningful way the fiduciary and trust obligations imposed on him as Band chief when it came to dealing with the Band council in his capacity as a locatee. He was either oblivious to his obligations or cavalier in his attitude towards them. In either event, the result is the same: he was in breach of the fiduciary and trust obligations imposed upon him by his position and benefited by the breach of those obligations in the amount of $112,500."
