The nature of the Band's decision entails the reduction of the applicant's salary and his duties and responsibilities as a Band councillor. In my opinion the actions taken against the applicant is akin to a loss of employment. In fact, Chief Evans would have certainly fired the applicant if he had been an employee. Given that the applicant is an elected member of the Band Council and therefore not officially an employee, Chief Evans did everything that he could to limit the applicant's duties, responsibilities and honorarium, even confiscating the computer he used in exercising his responsibilities as a councillor. The actions of Chief Evans were conducted with no respect whatsoever for the applicant's status as an elected member and a peer at the Council table. In
Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation v. Atkinson et al.
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 251; 228 F.T.R. 167 (T.D.), Justice Kelen addresses the issue of procedural fairness with regards to the continuation of one's employment by stating the following at paragraph 42:
"Decisions made by legislative bodies of a general nature and based on broad considerations of public policy are considered to be immune from the duty of fairness. In contrast, an administrative decision that is directed at a particular person and affects 'the rights, privileges or interests' of that individual will trigger the application of the duty of fairness, see
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, at para. 20. The content of the duty of fairness may also vary in correlation to the significance of the impact upon the individual in question. The Supreme Court has stated that when an individual's right to continue his or her employment is at stake 'a high standard of justice is required', see
Kane v. University of British Columbia
, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1105, at p. 1113."
