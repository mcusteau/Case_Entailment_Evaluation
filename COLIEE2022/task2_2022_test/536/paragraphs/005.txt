The "quorum of Council" is a sub-group of the Band Council councillors that operates separately from the rest of the Band Council. It does not follow the rules laid out in the guidelines for conducting convened meetings of Council. This sub-group of councillors should not be confused with what constitutes the quorum of the Band councillors at a convened Council meeting that is subject to the guidelines and paragraph 2(3)(b) of the
Indian Act
