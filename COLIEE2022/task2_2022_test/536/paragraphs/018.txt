Another way to be in conformity with Rule 302 occurs when the Court orders that an exception can be made. On October 26, 2004, Prothonotary Tabib considered the motion record of the applicant and noted the consent of the respondents to the amended notice of application. She ordered the matter to proceed despite the fact that judicial review was being sought for more than one decision of the NHCN Band Council. As such, I am satisfied that the present matter is in conformity with Rule 302 and it is unnecessary to analyze whether or not the relief sought by the applicant is justified pursuant to the "ongoing course of action" exception to the aforementioned rule.
