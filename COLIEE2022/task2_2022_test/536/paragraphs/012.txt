In
Long Lake Cree Nation v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs)
, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1020 (T.D.), Justice Rothstein, at paragraph 31, emphasized that Band Councils must operate according to the rule of law:
"On occasion, conflicts can become personal between individuals or groups on Council. But Councils must operate according to the rule of law whether that be the written law, custom law, the
Indian Act
or whatever other law may be applicable. Members of Council and/or members of the Band cannot take the law into their own hands. Otherwise, there is anarchy. The people entrust the Councilors to make decisions on their behalf and Councilors must carry out their responsibilities in a way that has regard for the people whose interest they have been elected to protect and represent. The fundamental point is that Councils must operate according to the rule of law."
