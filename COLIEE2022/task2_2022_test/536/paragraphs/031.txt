The NHCN government has its legal basis in the
Indian Act
even though the Band substituted its own electoral process, as regulated by the NHCN
Guidelines
, for those of the
Indian Act
. Similar to the federal
Indian Band Council Procedures Regulations
, the guidelines specify the dates and times for regularly scheduled Council meetings, notice requirements for special Council meetings, procedure for agenda items and conduct during the meetings. The pertinent provisions of the guidelines are as follows:
"11.1 Frequency of Meetings
Regular Chief and Council meetings shall commence promptly at 9:00 am on the first and third Tuesday of every month. All Managers and Directors must attend these regular Chief and Council meetings
.
"11.4 Special Council Meetings.
Special Council meetings may be called
by the Chief upon provision to each member of Council of twenty-four (24) hours' notice and a specific agenda relating to the special meeting.
Special meetings may be called by the Chief on his or her own initiative, or by the Chief at the request of a majority of Council
