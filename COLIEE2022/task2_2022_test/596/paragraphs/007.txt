In its decision, the Board also found no basis on which a claim could be sustained under section 97 of the IRPA and, accordingly, concluded that the applicant was not a person in need of protection. As the Board held at pages 1-2 of its decision:
... The panel finds that the claimant is not a person in need of protection in that his removal to Ethiopia would not subject him personally to a risk to his life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and that there are no substantial grounds to believe that his removal will subject him personally to a danger of torture. ...
It is this finding that the applicant seeks to have judicially reviewed.
