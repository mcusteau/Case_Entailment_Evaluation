In the case at bar, the Board concluded the applicant was not a person in need of protection under section 97 of the IRPA. After concluding that the applicant's lack of credibility and failure to claim asylum before arriving in Canada undermined his well-founded fear of persecution, the Board stated at page 7 of its decision:
For these reasons, the panel finds that the claimant has not established that he will face a serious possibility of persecution upon his return to Ethiopia, nor has he established that, on a balance of probabilities, he would suffer a risk to life, or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture, should he return to Ethiopia.
