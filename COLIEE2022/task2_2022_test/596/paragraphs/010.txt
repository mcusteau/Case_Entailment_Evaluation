[10]
Accordingly, I accept the following finding of Mr. Justice Blanchard in
Nyathi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2003 FC 1119, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1409 (QL) at paragraph 10 that the adequacy of the Board's section 97 analysis should be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness
simpliciter
:
Â¶ 10 ... The second issue is whether the Board erred in its assessment of whether the applicant is a person in need of protection under the Act. I am of the view that this raises a question of mixed fact and law for which the standard of review is reasonableness
simpliciter
....
ANALYSIS
Issue:
Did the Board err in failing to perform a separate analysis under section 97 of the IRPA
?
