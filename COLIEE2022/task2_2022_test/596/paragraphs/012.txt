An analysis under section 97 is different from the Board's determination of whether a refugee claimant is a Convention refugee under section 96 of the IRPA. Under section 96, the claimant must establish the existence of a well-founded fear of persecution tied to a Convention ground. However, under section 97 a claimant must show whether, on the balance of probabilities, their removal from Canada would subject them personally to the dangers and risks stipulated in paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b) of the IRPA. This is a wholly objective analysis, and must be evaluated in light of all relevant considerations and with a view to the country's human rights record: see
