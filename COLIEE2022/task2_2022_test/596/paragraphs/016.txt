The documentary evidence before the Court in this application crosses the threshold where the Board is not required to provide further analysis on the specific elements of section 97. The documentary evidence establishes that ordinary and suspected members of the CUD have been subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention, and abuse at the hands of the Ethiopian government: see the 2005 U.S. Department of State Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - Ethiopia at page 71 of the
Applicant's Application Record
and the letter from Amnesty International dated February 6, 2007 at page 297 of the
Certified Tribunal Record
. Further, the documentary evidence speaks of the possibilities of persecution for ordinary members and sympathizers of the CUD, without regard to levels of activity or leadership within the party.
