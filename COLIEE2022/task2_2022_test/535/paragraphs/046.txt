would then take place as part of an analysis conducted in accordance with subparagraph 113(d)(ii), and if the risk of torture was found to outweigh the nature and severity of the applicant's offence, then any removal order with respect to China would be stayed by paragraph 114(1)(b). Whether these safeguards satisfy the section 7 requirement for fundamental justice is a question for another day. The point to be taken from this discussion is that before the applicant can be removed to China, she is entitled to have the nature and severity of her alleged offence balanced against the risk of torture. The presence of the PRRA protects the applicant's section 7 rights. It is unnecessary for the Refugee Division to conduct the same balancing process as part of its analysis under Article 1F(b).
