The applicable standard of review for cases concerning Article 1F(b) was discussed by Décary, J.A., in
Harb v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)
(2003), 302 N.R. 178; 2003 FCA 39, at para. 14:
"Insofar as these are findings of fact they can only be reviewed if they are erroneous and made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the Refugee Division (this standard of review is laid down in s. 18.1(4)(d) of the
Federal Court Act
, and is defined in other jurisdictions by the phrase 'patently unreasonable'). These findings, insofar as they apply the law to the facts of the case, can only be reviewed if they are unreasonable. Insofar as they interpret the meaning of the exclusion clause, the findings can be reviewed if they are erroneous. (On the standard of review, see
Shrestha v. The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
, 2002 FCT 886, Lemieux, J., at paras. 10, 11 and 12.)"
