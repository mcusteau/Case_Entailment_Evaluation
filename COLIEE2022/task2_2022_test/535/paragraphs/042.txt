As support for her position, the applicant points to a statement from the Supreme Court at paragraph 75 of
Suresh
:
"We conclude that the better view is that international law rejects deportation to torture, even where national security interests are at stake. This is the norm which best informs the content of the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
."
The Court stated that this norm informs the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
, which in turn mandates balancing the risk of torture with the other interests involved before an individual can be deported to a country where they face a risk of torture. At paragraph 78, the Court stated that only in cases with "exceptional circumstances" would deportation to face torture be justified.
