I now turn to the offence at issue in the case at bar. The applicant has not contested the Refugee Division's decision to equate paragraph 380(1)(a) of the
Criminal Code
with Article 382 of the Criminal Law of China. Committing the offence of fraud over $5,000 described in paragraph 380(1)(a) renders an individual "liable to a term of imprisonment not exceeding ten years", meaning it meets the threshold set out by Robertson, J.A., in
Chan
. It also qualifies as a extraditable offence under subsection 3(1) of the
Extradition Act
. No evidence was presented as to whether there is an extradition treaty between Canada and China, but this is of little importance because the offence in question meets all three tests set out in subsection 3(1). As Nadon, J.A., stated in
Zrig
at paragraph 68, this indicates the offence is serious enough to fall under the Article 1F(b) exclusion.
