The Refugee Division found there was more than a mere possibility the applicant would face torture if returned to China while incarcerated during the investigation leading up to the laying of charges. On that basis, the Refugee Division concluded that

The applicant argues the panel erred by not balancing the seriousness of the applicant's alleged offence against the persecution she might suffer upon her return to China as part of its Article 1F(b) analysis.
