Third, commentary concerning Article 1F(b) does not support the view that purely economic crimes should be excluded from the scope of the exclusion clause. In his discussion on Article 1F(c) in
The Definition of Convention Refugee
(Toronto: Butterworths, 2001) at ยง8.532 to ยง8.540, Lorne Waldman makes no distinction between violent crimes and purely economic ones. Instead, he states at ยง8.536 that the analysis should include such factors as "the gravity of the offence, the potential sentence that is likely to be imposed, existence of any previous criminal record, and any mitigating and aggravating circumstances". James C. Hathaway in
The Law of Refugee Status
(Toronto: Butterworths, 1991) at page 224 refers to a serious crime as one punishable by several years of imprisonment. Again, no distinction is made between violent offences and purely economic offences. And Guy Goodwin-Gill in
The Refugee in International Law
, 2nd Ed. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996) at page 107 indicates that purely economic crimes such as embezzlement can constitute serious crimes if the value of the property involved is significant:
"The following offences might also be considered to constitute serious crimes, provided other factors were present: breaking and entering (burglary); stealing (theft and simple robbery); receiving stolen property;
embezzlement
; possession of drugs in quantities exceeding that required for personal use; an assault. Factors to support a finding of seriousness included: use of weapons, injury to person;
value of property involved
; type of drugs involved; evidence of habitual criminal conduct." (Emphasis added and footnotes omitted.)
