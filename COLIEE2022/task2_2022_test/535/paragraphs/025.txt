Somewhat surprisingly, there is no definitive answer on whether a purely economic crime qualifies as a serious non-political crime. The guidance provided by the
UNHCR Handbook
, that a serious non-political crime "must be a capital crime or a very grave punishable act", is of little help in answering this question. While graft is a capital crime in China, that is not the case in this country, and it would be inconsistent with the general approach taken in the
IPRA
to rely solely upon the punishment imposed in a claimant's country of origin in determining whether he or she had committed a crime that justified exclusion under Article 1F(b). As for the second half of the
UNHCR Handbook's
definition, it simply begs the question of whether a purely economic crime qualifies as "a very grave punishable act."
