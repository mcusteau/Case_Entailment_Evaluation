This distinction originated with the
Refugee Convention
. As Hathaway points out at pages 225-226 of
The Law of Refugee Status
, supra, Article 33(2) provides a state the means to expel or return dangerous refugees and sets a more exacting standard of proof than Article 1F(b), which "is designed to afford the possibility of pre-admission exclusion on the basis of a relatively low standard of proof." Individuals caught by Article 1F(b) are excluded from the definition of a Convention refugee and cannot avail themselves of the protection offered by Article 33 or its domestic equivalents. Likewise, while the decision in
