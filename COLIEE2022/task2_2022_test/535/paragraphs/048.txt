[48]
For these reasons, this application for judicial review is dismissed. Both parties proposed questions along the following lines for certification. I agree that these questions warrant certification, and certify the following two questions:
1. Can a refugee claimant be excluded from protection under Article 1F(b) of the
Refugee Convention
for committing a purely economic offence?
2. In light of
Suresh
, is the Refugee Division required to conduct a balancing of the nature and severity of the claimant's offence against the possibility that he or she might face torture if returned to his or her country of origin?
Application dismissed.
