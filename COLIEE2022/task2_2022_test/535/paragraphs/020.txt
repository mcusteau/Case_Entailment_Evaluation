The applicant testified at the hearing that she has been falsely accused of embezzlement because she refused to follow illegal orders from her superiors. This explanation was rejected by the panel due to a number of credibility concerns it had with the applicant's testimony. The applicant submits the Refugee Division erred in its credibility finding and improperly relied upon inadequate evidence when it found there were serious reasons for considering her to have committed embezzlement.
