Furthermore, the surrounding circumstances of this case do not militate against the application of the exclusion clause to the applicant. Unlike the claimant in
Chan
, the applicant did not serve her sentence prior to her arrival in Canada. This case is also fundamentally different than
Brzezinski
as there is no doubt the applicant's alleged offence is a grave one. If the fraud in question was just over the $5,000 threshold, there might be grounds for thinking otherwise. In a case of that nature, one would not expect the maximum penalty to be applied and a plea bargain to the lesser offence of fraud under $5,000 would be a reasonable possibility. But the applicant has been accused of embezzling C $1.4 million while holding a position of public trust. To her credit the applicant does not appear to have a prior criminal record; nonetheless, that the embezzlement is alleged to have occurred over a 20-month period demonstrates that this was not a one-time event. There is no doubt the offence the applicant is accused of qualifies as a serious non-political offence.
