While somewhat more helpful, the jurisprudence of this Court is not definitive on this question either. In deciding that graft constituted a serious non-political crime, the Refugee Division relied upon the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
Chan
, supra. The claimant in
Chan
had been convicted in the United States of "the offence of illegal use of a communication device (a pager) ... an offence defined in connection with offences related to drug trafficking" and received a 14-month sentence. In the process of determining that Article 1F(b) is not applicable to a claimant who has served his or her sentence prior to arriving in Canada, Robertson, J.A., faced the issue of whether the claimant's non-violent offence constituted a serious non-political crime. In that regard, he stated at paragraph 9:
"This part of my analysis begins with the presumption that the appellant's conviction in the United States constitutes a serious non-political crime within the meaning of Article 1F(b). While this presumption is contrary to the appellant's interests, it is consistent with the position articulated by the Board and adopted by the Motions Judge. In this regard, the Motions Judge held that the Board did not err in concluding that the appellant's conviction arose out of an offence involving drug trafficking and that such conduct amounted to a serious non-political crime. This was so despite the fact that the appellant was convicted not for drug trafficking per se but for the unlawful use of a communication device, an offence unknown to Canadian law. Moreover, I am going to presume that, had the appellant engaged in similar conduct in Canada, he would have been convicted of an offence such as drug trafficking for which a maximum prison term of ten years or more could have been imposed.
In other words, for present purposes I will presume, without deciding, that a serious non-political crime is to be equated with one in which a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada.
