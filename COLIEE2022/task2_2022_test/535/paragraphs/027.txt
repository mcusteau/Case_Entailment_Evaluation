As can be seen, rather than linking the determination under Article 1F(b) to the nature of the crime in question, Robertson, J.A., defined a serious crime by reference to the applicable maximum sentence that could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada. Even though Robertson, J.A., did not decide this issue, his approach is a sensible one and I intend to follow it. There are several reasons why I think his approach makes sense.
