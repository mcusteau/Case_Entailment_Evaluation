After impugning the applicant's credibility, the Refugee Division turned to the Minister's application for exclusion. The panel determined that the applicant was excluded from protection "as a person in need of protection" pursuant to section 97 of
IRPA
(see paragraph 14 below) because there were "serious reasons for considering" the applicant to have committed a "serious non-political crime." The serious reasons identified by the panel were the INTERPOL arrest warrant and the applicant's inexplicable wealth. An examination of the arrest warrant showed it to be credible and trustworthy, although the maximum penalty for embezzlement was incorrectly identified as life imprisonment, and not death as is stated in the statute. The panel noted the large sums of money the applicant and her daughter had in their names despite their low incomes. The applicant testified that she has 9 million RMB, which is approximately C $1.8 million, and her daughter, who is a cashier in Canada, had the equivalent of approximately C $900,000 in a Hong Kong bank account. The panel rejected the applicant's claim that the money was her share of investment income earned by her and her ex-husband, because "some of the documents provided to confirm her story were inconclusive or ambiguous." Further, the panel stated it was unclear, given the applicant's personal fortune, why she continued to work in a "relatively low paying job where she was regularly censured, humiliated, and asked to perform illegal acts."
