After an examination of the relevant documentary evidence, the panel concluded there was more than a mere possibility that the applicant would face torture if deported to China while incarcerated during the investigation leading up to the laying of charges. The panel held:
"After reviewing the extensive documentary materials filed in this claim, I am of the view that there is more than a mere possibility that this claimant would face being tortured while incarcerated in the investigation leading up to any charges being laid."
Moreover, the panel was of the opinion that being tortured as a criminal suspect cannot be considered a risk inherent to the application of a lawful sanction. Therefore, if the applicant had not been excluded from the definition of a person in need of protection by reason of Article 1F(b), she would be a person described in paragraph 97(1)(a).
