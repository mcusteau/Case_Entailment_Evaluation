The Refugee Division denied the applicant's claim because she lacked credibility, and was excluded from claiming protection by Article 1F(b). It rejected the applicant's allegation that she was framed by her superiors for refusing to carry out illegal orders. The Refugee Division cited numerous implausibilities, inconsistencies and contradictions in the applicant's version of events and the documentary evidence before the Board. It concluded at page 22 of the decision:
"The claimant never exposed anyone for anything in China. She was not a 'whistle blower.' There was no public political aspect to what she did."
