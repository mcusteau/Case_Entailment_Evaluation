The applicant's story was incredibly complex and the written narrative attached to her PIF stretches to fourteen pages. The Refugee Division's analysis of the applicant's story was extensive and highlighted a large number of implausibilities, inconsistencies and contradictions in the applicant's version of events and the documentary evidence before the Board. In her submissions to the Court, the applicant has challenged most of the inconsistencies and implausibilities identified by the Refugee Division; however, her submissions simply reiterate the explanations she relied upon during her hearing. She has not demonstrated the Refugee Division made its decision in a perverse or capricious manner, or acted without regard for the material before it. In essence, the applicant is asking the Court to re-weigh the evidence that was before the Refugee Division, which is not the role of the Court on an application for judicial review. The credibility and implausibility findings of the Refugee Division are based on the evidence, supported by detailed reasons, and reasonably open to the panel. Accordingly, they are not patently unreasonable.
Issue No. 2: Did the Refugee Division err in law by relying upon the INTERPOL warrant and the letter from the Chinese Government to the Canadian Government describing the applicant's alleged crime as sufficient evidence that the applicant committed a "serious crime"?
