The Refugee Division then examined whether embezzlement constituted a serious non-political crime. It cited
Chan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2000), 260 N.R. 376; 10 Imm. L.R.(3d) 167 (F.C.A.), at p. 173 (C.A.) as authority for equating a serious non-political crime with one where a maximum sentence of ten years could have been imposed had the offence been committed in Canada. The panel also relied on the guidance provided by paragraph 155 of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees'
Handbook on Procedures for Determining Refugee Status
(the "
UNHCR Handbook
"), which identifies a serious crime as one that "must be a capital crime or a very grave punishable act." Based on these sources, the panel concluded: "Article 1F(b) contains no prohibition against serious non-violent economic crimes being the basis for exclusion."
