As the panel correctly stated, the evidentiary standard in immigration proceedings to establish that the applicant committed the crime is not the same as in the arena of criminal or civil law:
Legault
, supra. The evidence of the crime must meet a threshold described as "serious reasons for considering" that the applicant committed the crime. The threshold is something "more than suspicion or conjecture" but less than evidence on the balance of probabilities:
Sivakumar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1994] 1 F.C. 433; 163 N.R. 197 (F.C.A.), at para. 18 (C.A.). The panel was of the view the INTERPOL warrant was trustworthy and stated the applicant's inability to explain her considerable wealth as a corroborating factor. The applicant has failed to demonstrate the panel acted unreasonably in its assessment of the evidence. I am satisfied that the panel did not err by finding there were serious reasons for considering that the applicant committed the offence detailed in the INTERPOL warrant.
Issue No. 3: Did the Refugee Division err in law by considering an "economic crime", not including any violence, to be a "serious non-political crime" for the purpose of Article 1F(b) of the Convention?
