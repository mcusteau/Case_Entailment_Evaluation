In the case at bar, where imprisonment and privilege of parole are involved, I am of the view that the administrative decision must not be interfered with by this court failing clear and unequivocal evidence that the decision is quite unfair and works a serious injustice on the inmate. This being said, I am in full agreement with the following view as expressed by Mr. Justice Strayer in Lathan v. Solicitor General of Canada et al., [1984] 2 F.C. 734, at page 744:
"While parole is not a right but a privilege, and therefore its revocation does not require the judicialtype process more commonly associated with the concept of natural justice, it does require at least an observance of fairness. In determining the requirements of fairness in any given situation I believe it is necessary to consider what the nature of the consequences is for the person who has allegedly been denied fairness."
