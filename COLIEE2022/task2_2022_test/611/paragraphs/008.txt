The fundamental decision that is being attacked by the applicant is a purely administrative one, but there is no doubt that such a decision is still entirely subject to judicial review, its validity in law depending on jurisdictional as well as procedural conditions. In that context, I consider that the rules of natural justice and of fairness are common law rules that are flexible in the sense that they have to be applied on the circumstances of the particular case. (Martineau v. Matsqui Institution Disciplinary Board (No. 2), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602; 30 N.R. 119, at 630. Per Dickson, J.: "The content of the principles of natural justice and fairness in application to the individual cases will vary according to the circumstances of each case ...") With respect to the requirements of fundamental justice referred to in s. 7 of the Charter, La Forest, J., of the Supreme Court of Canada, in R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309; 80 N.R. 161; 82 N.S.R.(2d) 271; 207 A.P.R. 271, at p. 361, expressed the appropriate view as follows:
"It is also clear that the requirements of fundamental justice are not immutable; rather they vary according to the context in which they are invoked."
