At the hearing, counsel for the applicant made four submissions, each based on procedural grounds and related to the hearing that resulted in the original decision made by the National Parole Board pursuant to s. 21.4(4)(a) of the Act. The submissions deal with the recording or transcript of the hearing before the Board, the content of confidential reports considered by the Board, pictures of victim children's injuries viewed by the Board, and the fact that the Board was made up of non-English speaking persons.
