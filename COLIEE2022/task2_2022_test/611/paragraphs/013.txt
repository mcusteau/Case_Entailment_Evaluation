Section 16.2 of the Parole Regulations states that the Board must keep a voice recording or a written transcript of a hearing such as that held on January 6, 1989. While it is important that all the regulations be observed in the course of a detention hearing, including the making of a satisfactory recording (see Okeynan v. Prince Albert Penitentiary and National Parole Board (1988), 20 F.T.R. 270 (F.C.T.D.)). I am not satisfied, here, that the applicant has established any prejudice. A mere broad allegation by the applicant of a poor recording of the proceedings at the hearing does not satisfy me that there is a serious possibility that a gap in the transcript deprived the applicant of a ground of review. In R. v. Hayes (1989), 89 N.R. 138; 89 N.S.R.(2d) 286; 227 A.P.R. 286; 48 C.C.C.(3d) 161 (S.C.C.), a criminal case, Mme Justice L'Heureux-Dub√©, of the Supreme Court of Canada stated, at page 165:
"A new trial need not be ordered for every gap in a transcript. As a general rule, there must be a serious possibility that there was an error in the missing portion of the transcript, or that the omission deprived the appellant of a ground of appeal."
