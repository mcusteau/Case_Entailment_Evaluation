The Board clearly made errors with respect to the year of certain events. Certain misunderstandings regarding the days on which certain incidents occurred can be reconciled by reference to the Applicant's Personal Information Form; however, the years of these dates remain incorrect. Nevertheless, these errors are not flagrant errors of fact. Rather, these errors can be more properly described as clerical errors. The reasons of the Board were not impacted by these mistakes. The reasoning regarding the Applicant's credibility, as well as reasons with respect to state protection and internal flight alternative were not dependant on the dates contested by the Applicant. In my view, these clerical errors do not amount to reviewable errors.
