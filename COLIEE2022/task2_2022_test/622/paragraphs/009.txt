The Board made the following findings:
- Based on the Applicant's Venezuelan passport, the Applicant is a citizen of Venezuela, and has no legal status in any other country.
- There was no travel registered between Columbia and Venezuela on the Applicant's passport, although the Applicant says she moved to Columbia to work and live with her common-law spouse. At the Port of Entry, the Applicant claimed that she never had to use a passport. The panel doubted this, and found that this statement casts doubt on the credibility of all the claimant's allegations.
- The Applicant was inconsistent in relating the alleged visit by FARC to her mother's home on May 8th, 2004, and this inconsistency goes to the credibility and believability of the Applicant. In her Personal Information Form, the Applicant claimed that the men threatened that they would kill both her and her family if she did not collaborate with them. They also told the Applicant that she got herself in trouble with FARC and owed them money. In her testimony, the Applicant claims that she and her mother did not answer the men's loud knocking, and that the men went away.
- Although the Applicant alleged that there are close connections between the FARC and the current ruling Venezuelan government, there is no indication that FARC operates in Venezuela, or that citizens of Venezuela would not be protected by their authorities from the FARC.
- The only evidence in support of such close connections between the FARC and Venezuela was an article from the Economist dated October 6, 2003.
- The Applicant filed a police report, but the Applicant did not follow up on the complaint. Instead, she left the country within a short period of time.
- The Applicant had an internal flight alternative (IFA). She could have relocated to Caracas.
