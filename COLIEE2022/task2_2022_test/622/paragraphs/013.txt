The Applicant submits that the Board's findings with respect to the Applicant's credibility are premised on an unduly restrictive margin of appreciation of perceived flaws in an Applicant's testimony. The Applicant submits that a reasonable margin of appreciation should be applied to any perceived flaws in an Applicant's testimony (Benjamin Attakora v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, Federal Court of Appeal Decision A-1091-87, May 19, 1989). The Applicant argues that while she did not add the details of the death threats to her and her family or of the men's claim that the Applicant owed money to the FARC in oral testimony, this did not contradict her earlier account of the incident. The omission of detail in the oral narrative did not mean that her two narratives were in basic contradiction or inconsistent.
