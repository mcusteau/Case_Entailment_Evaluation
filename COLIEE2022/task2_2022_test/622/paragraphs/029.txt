As the Respondent notes, the Board's finding of doubt regarding the Applicant's story that she never had to use a passport when traveling between Columbia and Venezuela is not discussed in the Applicant's memorandum or affidavit, nor at the hearing before me. It is not specifically challenged by the Applicant. The Board found that this statement casts doubts on the credibility of all the Applicant's allegations.
