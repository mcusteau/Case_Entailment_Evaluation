The Board's multiple errors of fact with respect to the dates of events are flagrant errors of fact. The Applicant submits that the Board erred in fact by finding that the Applicant went to the United States on May 29, 2004, and then went to Canada May 21, 2004. The Applicant submits that the years should have been 2003, and that the Board has developed an impossible chronological order of events. The Applicant also submits that the Board erred in fact by finding that the Applicant referred to the alleged visit to her mother's house occurred on May 8, 2004, when the Applicant alleges that it occurred on May 12, 2003 or May 18, 2004.
