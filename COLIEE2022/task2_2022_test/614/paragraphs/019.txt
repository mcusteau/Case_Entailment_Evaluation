The Board also questioned how Mr. Azam was in a position to write in the letter that “even at present they are threatening his father in various ways and recently his mother was terminated from her job.” Because the Applicant testified that perhaps his uncle, who had acquired the letter on his behalf, had mentioned the information to Mr. Azam, the Board concluded that the letter merely reiterates what was told to Mr. Azam by the Applicant’s uncle. As a result, the Board gave little weight to this letter as corroborative evidence.
