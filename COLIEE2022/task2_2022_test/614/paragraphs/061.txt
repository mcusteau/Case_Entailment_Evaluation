In its reasons, the Board does not point to any omissions, inconsistencies or contradictions in the Applicant’s PIF or in his testimony at the hearing in dismissing the Applicant’s claim for refugee protection. I note also that the Board did not conclude that the Applicant is not a credible witness. Rather, the Board refers to a number of implausibilities and an insufficiency of supporting documentary evidence to justify a finding that the basis for the Applicant’s refugee claim is not credible. Ultimately, the Board did not believe that the Applicant is being persecuted by BNP goons or the police because of his political opinion, or that his life is at risk. The Board determined that, save possibly the incident on December 16, 2002, the alleged attacks against the Applicant and his parents did not happen. Moreover, as the Board concluded that the Applicant had not established a well-founded subjective fear of persecution, it did not go on to consider the objective basis for the Applicant’s refugee claim, namely, the existence of an internal flight alternative and of adequate state protection.
