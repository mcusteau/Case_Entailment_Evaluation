Finally, regarding the issue of delay in claiming refugee status, I am of the view that the evidence does not support the Board’s finding that, essentially, the only reason the Applicant made a refugee claim was because his marks were not good enough to allow him to continue studying at the University of Windsor. Although at the hearing held in August 2004 – eight months after his term at the University of Windsor ended – the Board asked the Applicant whether he thinks the University of Windsor would allow him to return to the school, there is no indication in the record before the Board that the Applicant could not return to the University of Windsor, or that he could not have attended another educational institution on the student visa he possessed. Consequently, I am of the opinion that it was not open to the Board to speculate on the reason for the Applicant not filing his refugee protection claim until January 2004. Moreover, I note that the Applicant did give a reason in his PIF for not claiming refugee status earlier than he did. He stated that since his father could support him financially, the Applicant thought he could study and begin a new life in Canada. However, he added, when problems for him in Bangladesh became worse day-to-day, he felt he had no alternative but to apply for refugee status, which consequently jeopardized his status as a student in Canada. During the hearing, neither the RPO nor the Board questioned the Applicant about the reasons he gave in his PIF for not making a claim for refugee protection when he first arrived in Canada. As to whether the Board breached the principles of procedural fairness in making a finding with respect to delay, I agree that the Board should have given the Applicant and opportunity to respond if the Board did not accept the Applicant’s explanation as to why he waited until January 2004 to file his claim for refugee protection. However, in reading the Board’s reasons, it appears that the Applicant’s delay in making his refugee claim was not determinative of its conclusion that the Applicant has not established a subjective fear of persecution. Rather, the Board reiterated that this conclusion is based on its finding regarding the credibility of the incidents underlying the Applicant’s refugee claim. As such, I find that the Board did not breach the principles of procedural fairness in not questioning the Applicant on the explanation he provided for his delay in claiming refugee protection in Canada.
