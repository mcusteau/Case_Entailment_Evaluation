The Applicant says that the Board erred in drawing an adverse inference from his failure to produce other supporting documentary evidence, especially given that his testimony was “uncontradicted and credible.” In support of his position, the Applicant cites Justice Dolores Hansen’s order in IMM-10509-04, Taramatti Murray, William Howard Murray v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, dated October 31, 2005, in which Justice Hansen states that “…a tribunal may not reject a claimant’s sworn testimony solely on the basis of a lack of documentary evidence supporting the vive voce evidence.” Further, the Applicant states that he testified to making reasonable efforts to obtain other documents and, as a consequence, it was erroneous for the Board to rely on Rule 7 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules and make a negative credibility finding.
