Fourth, regarding the letter from Mr. Saha, a lawyer in Bangladesh, the Board accepted that Mr. Saha had written the letter and that he knew the Applicant’s father. However, with respect to Mr. Saha’s statement that the police would arrest the Applicant under the Special Powers Act (SPA) and would confine him in jail for an indefinite period, the Board concluded that the police are not looking to detain the Applicant under the SPA. The Board noted that the Canadian Embassy was told by a number of police stations in Bangladesh that there was no list of persons wanted under the SPA and that some kind of arrest warrant was needed before the police could determine that a person was wanted under the SPA. Only in “special circumstances” would an arrest warrant be issued, and the Board held that there were no special circumstances in play in relation to the Applicant. The Board stated that an Amnesty International report supported the evidence that an arrest warrant would be required.
