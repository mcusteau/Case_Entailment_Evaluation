The Applicant argues that it is “ridiculous” for the Board to suggest that the Applicant is not at risk because his name was not on the posters or leaflets. In fact, the Applicant states that, given the serious repercussions, it would be surprising to find any names of AL members listed on posters or leaflets critical of the BNP. Additionally, the Applicant argues that the Board’s finding that the AL’s losing the election contradicts his assertion that his posters helped increase the popularity of the AL is erroneous, as there is nothing contradictory between the election results and the impact of the posters.
