Moreover, with respect to Mr. Saha’s letter regarding his investigation into the interest of the Bangladeshi police in the Applicant, I am of the view that the Board did not have a sufficient basis for discrediting Mr. Saha’s letter. The Board acknowledged that it had received confirmation that Mr. Saha is a member of the Bar in Bangladesh and provided no reason to question the genuineness of Mr. Saha’s letter. However, the Board discounts Mr. Saha’s letter on the basis of information it received through the Canadian Embassy in Bangladesh. Based on that information, the Board found it was implausible that the police were looking to arrest the Applicant under the SPA because he did not fall into any “special circumstances” that would warrant his arrest. In my view, the evidence does not clearly invalidate Mr. Saha’s suggestion that the police might arrest the Applicant under the SPA. In fact, the Amnesty International report of September 2002 indicates that the SPA has been used by the BNP, and the AL in the past, as a means to control and silence opposition. Further, I agree with the Applicant that the Board overstepped its jurisdiction by essentially taking judicial notice of the police practice in relation to the SPA. The Respondent states that the Board was drawing on its experience in hearing refugee cases from Bangladesh, but if such were the case it seems likely that the Board would have been able to provide a source for this information. With respect to the source being the Canadian Embassy, I note that it is unclear from the Board’s reasons how the information was communicated by the embassy to the Board. In any event, given the current political situation in Bangladesh, it is plausible that the powers under the SPA are being used in ways beyond what the legislation was originally intended for.
