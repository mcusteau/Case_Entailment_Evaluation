[28]
Under the standard of patent unreasonableness, as long as there is evidence to support the Board’s finding in relation to credibility or plausibility, and no overriding error has occurred, the Board’s Decision should not be disturbed. For example, in relation to an implausibility finding, the Court may intervene where there is no evidentiary basis to support such a finding. This was affirmed by Justice Andrew MacKay in Yada v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 140 F.T.R. 264 at paragraph 25:
25. Where the finding of a lack of credibility is based upon implausibilities identified by the panel, the Court may intervene on judicial review and set aside the finding where the reasons that are stated are not supported by the evidence before the panel, and the Court is in no worse position than the hearing panel to consider inferences and conclusions based on criteria external to the evidence such as rationality, or common sense (see Giron v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (1992), 143 N.R. 238 (F.C.A.)).
However, the Court should not seek to reweigh evidence before the Board simply because it would have reached a different conclusion.
