Essentially, the Board did not accept that BNP goons would be interested in the Applicant as he was not a leader of the AL or presumed to be the author of the posters and leaflets criticizing the BNP. The Board did not believe the Applicant’s explanation that the BNP goons found out it was he who produced the posters and leaflets and that the goons were interested in the Applicant even though he was not the author of the content contained on the posters and in the leaflets. The Board also discounted the documentary evidence – namely, the medical report from Dr. Chowdhury’s in relation to the wound suffered by the Applicant on December 16, 2002, the letter of termination of employment received by the Applicant’s mother, and the letter from Mr. Azam, General Secretary of the Awami Jubo League – provided by the Applicant, which he says supports his contention that he is targeted by the BNP authorities and goons because of his political opinion.
