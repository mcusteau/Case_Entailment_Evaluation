There has been some division of opinion in this court concerning the jurisdiction of the court to make such recommendations. I respectfully agree with those judges who have found that the court has no such jurisdiction. (See e.g.,
Re Akins
(1978), 87 D.L.R.(3d) 93;
Re Boutros
, [1980] 1 F.C. 624; and
Re Aaron
, [1982] 2 F.C. 348) The appeal to this court which is authorized under subs. 14(5) is an appeal "from the decision of the citizenship judge under subs. (2) ...", and the decision referred to in that subsection is a decision of the judge to approve or not approve the application. The power given to a citizenship judge in s. 15(1) with respect to the exercise of discretion on compassionate grounds is that of making a recommendation to the Minister in this respect. This is not a "decision" under s. 14(2).
