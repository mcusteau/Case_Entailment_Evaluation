Section 14(2) provides, however, that as a precondition to making a decision under the subsection, the citizenship judge must consider whether or not to make a recommendation under s. 15(1). While it is not for this court, sitting on appeal, to review the conclusion of the citizenship judge as to whether a recommendation should be made, in a proper case it may be open to this court to refer the matter back to the citizenship judge if this court is not satisfied that relevant factors have been taken into account in the exercise of that discretion. That appears to be the rationale for the decision by my colleague Rouleau, J., in
Re Hanne H. Hokayem
(September 19, 1990, F.C.T.D. File T-583-90, 37 F.T.R. 49). In that case he referred the matter back to the citizenship judge and "urged" that judge to consider certain factors outlined in the reasons of Rouleau, J. Similarly in this case I have ordered that the matter be referred back to the citizenship judge for reconsideration as to whether the discretion under s. 15(1) should have been exercised in favour of the appellant before making the decision under s. 14(2), having particular regard to the applicant's apparent lack of ability to become literate in an official language of Canada. Because the exercise of that discretion is uniquely a matter for the citizenship judge, it is of course for her to satisfy herself from the evidence as to the inability referred to, and for her to determine whether such a factor warrants a recommendation on compassionate grounds.
