I am taking this step because it is not apparent from the reasons for the citizenship judge's decision given to the appellant, nor from those given to the Minister, that this obviously relevant factor had been taken into account. Indeed there is no indication as to what factors were taken into account. As the proper exercise of the discretion is a precondition to the exercise of the power to make a decision under s. 14(2), it is important that this court be satisfied on appeal that the discretion has in fact been exercised. It would be particularly helpful that the reasons given by the citizenship judge for refusing a favourable exercise of a discretion be indicated, at least in relation to compassionate grounds specifically urged by the applicant.
Order accordingly.
