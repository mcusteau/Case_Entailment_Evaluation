I believe that this application can be distilled into four general grounds for review. The first ground of review is that the visa officer did not inform the applicant of his concerns. The decision in
Muliadi v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1986] 2 F.C. 205; 66 N.R. 8 (C.A.), states that a visa officer has a duty of fairness to provide the applicant with knowledge of the officer's concerns and an opportunity to respond. However, MacKay, J., noted the following in
Yu v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1990), 36 F.T.R. 296; 11 Imm. L.R.(2d) 176 (T.D.), at p. 187:
"In my view, there is no ground for arguing unfairness in the process merely because the visa officer at the interview of the applicant does not stress all of the concerns he may have that arise directly from the
Act
and
Regulations
that he is bound to follow in his assessment of the application. The
Act
and
Regulations
pertinent to admission are available to applicants whose task is to establish to the satisfaction of the visa officer that they meet the criteria set out, and that their admissions to Canada would not be contrary to the
Act
."
MacKay, J., repeated this opinion in
Parmar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] F.C.J. No. 1532; 139 F.T.R. 203 (T.D.).
