The second issue is whether the visa officer violated the duty of fairness by delegating the hearing of the interview to Ms. Solis. In D.J. Mullan,
Administrative Law
(2nd Ed. 1979), the authors state the following at page 3-112:
"[a] statutory decision-maker may legitimately in some cases delegate the task of collection, sorting, sifting and summarizing of evidence to someone else provided the extent of the delegation is not such that the final decision is in effect taken by the delegate rather than the statutory decision-maker. In other words, the statutory decision-maker is obliged to take the decision personally on the basis of an adequate knowledge of all sides of the matter in controversy." (Footnotes omitted)
The aforementioned statement should also be read in the light of Hugessen, J.A.'s, statement in
Shah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 170 N.R. 238; 29 Imm. L.R.(2d) 82 (F.C.A.), at p. 83 that "the content of the duty of fairness varies according to the circumstances".
