The applicant points to the
Act
and the
Regulations
and states that they require "at most, only that a permanent and ongoing company be in existence in Canada" (see paragraph 13 of the applicant's Memorandum of Argument). I have reviewed the relevant sections of the
Act
and the
Regulations
and I draw the conclusion drawn by applicant's counsel. As the respondent points out, the word "establish" is defined in the
Concise Oxford Dictionary
as "set up on permanent basis ...". Therefore, I would agree with the respondent that the applicant is engaging in pure semantics and this ground of review should fail.
