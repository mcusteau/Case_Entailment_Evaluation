In this case, the applicant states that Ms. Solis relied on information supplied from the applicant's brother but this fact was never brought to his attention. I assume that he is referring to the statement that either Mr. Amir Ali or the applicant would stay in Canada to work. Since the applicant admits making a similar statement, I do not understand the basis of the applicant's complaint.
