Regarding the argument that the immigration officer attached undue weight to the applicant's 1993 misrepresentation of her marital status while excluding consideration of other relevant factors, a review of the record does not support such a finding. The officer considered the applicant's immigration history as a relevant factor. He also considered that the applicant's husband was aware, at the time of the marriage, that there was a deportation order against her. Additionally, he considered that the applicant had no dependants. Finally, he considered that the applicant had not always been truthful with immigration officials. Regarding the last factor, there was more than sufficient evidence, in addition to the 1993 misrepresentation, to support this conclusion. It was open to the officer to consider all of these factors. He additionally considered the applicant's marriage to a Canadian citizen, her long-term employment, the fact that most of her family members reside in Canada, her father's poor health, the community support behind her and the poor living conditions in the Philippines including the gender equality problems associated with finding employment. The weighing of these factors was within his discretion. I note the comments of Iacobbucci, J., in
Ryan v. Law Society of New Brunswick
(2003), 302 N.R. 1; 257 N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207; 2003 SCC 20 (S.C.C.), at paragraph 55, wherein the nature of the standard of reasonableness is discussed.
"A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere (see
Southam
, supra, at para. 56). This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling (see
Southam
, supra, at para. 79)."
Those comments are appropriate in relation to the applicant's second argument. In my view, the immigration officer's decision is supported by a tenable explanation and is therefore reasonable.
