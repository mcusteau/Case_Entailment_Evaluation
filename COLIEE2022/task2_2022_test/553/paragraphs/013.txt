The guidelines next state that a positive sponsorship application
can
be considered as a favourable H & C factor. They do not dictate imperative consideration. While the sponsorship application is obviously relevant and important, the fact remains that an officer is not obliged, by the guidelines, to refer to it as a specific consideration although it is reasonable to assume that it would militate in favour of an applicant. That being said, an allegation that an immigration officer failed to conform to the guidelines by not specifically referring to a favourable sponsorship application, without more, will not sustain an argument of breach of procedural fairness. This is particularly so where, as here, the same officer determines both applications.
Amanfo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.T.R. Uned. 825; 17 Imm. L.R.(3d) 16 (T.D.), relied upon by the applicant is distinguishable because, there, the sponsorship application had not been determined prior to the determination of the H & C application.
