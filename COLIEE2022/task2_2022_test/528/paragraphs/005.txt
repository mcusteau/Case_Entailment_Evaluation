An admissibility hearing took place on May 8, 17 and 24, 2006. One of the principle issues in dispute was whether the Applicant was inadmissible on the grounds of organized criminality under paragraph 37(1)(a) of IRPA. Much of the testimony of the Applicant was inconsistent with his evidence before the officer at the port of entry. Of importance here was his statement that he actually joined MS-13 only in 1995 and that his earlier description of his initiation into the gang in 1992 was not true.
