The Applicant clearly admitted knowledge of the criminal activities. The Panel supported its finding that the Applicant had knowledge of the group’s activities with multiple evidentiary references. For instance, at the port of entry, in his background information the Applicant was asked “Have you ever been associated with a group that used, uses, advocated or advocates the use of armed struggle or violence to reach political, religious or ideological objectives.” The Applicant checked off “yes” in response. He also checked “yes” to the question of whether he “used, planned or advocated the use of armed struggle or violence to reach political, religious or ideological objectives.” He states in the explanatory notes to those statements that he planned violence with MS-13. He also notes that he was detained for being involved in a fight between MS and “18”. He stated outright that he tried to recruit youth and had one person join because of him at the port of entry. Furthermore, his testimony suggests he knew about the physical violence of the gang and the drug crimes. He even admitted he initiated someone into the gang (although stating that he was forced to do so) by hitting the person for 12 to14 seconds with his hands. This suggests that the gang was involved in serious crimes.
