The Panel heavily relied on the testimony of Mr. Hector Alicea. The Applicant submits that the Panel erred in placing so much reliance on his testimony. Mr. Alicea testified that the deportations were taking place in the mid-1980s. The Applicant notes that Mr. Alicea also testified initially on at least two occasions that the civil war in El Salvador ended in 1979. He admitted he was wrong as to the end date of the war only in cross-examination. Thus, according to the Applicant, Mr. Alicea’s timeline was off by a similar period of time, meaning that the deportations to El Salvador happened not in the mid-1980’s but from the mid-1990’s and following. The Applicant notes that this finding is crucial as the Panel relied on Mr. Alicea’s testimony in support of the finding that the gang engaged in criminal activities during the period when the Applicant was involved. Mr. Alicea also testified that the gang was extremely active between 1992 and 1995 in Usulutan, El Salvador, the area in which the Applicant lived. Thus, the Applicant submits that, although the MS-13 may have engaged in the criminal activities that Mr. Alicea alleged, that would have been the activity and presence of the organization at a later date, not the time period when the Applicant was involved.
