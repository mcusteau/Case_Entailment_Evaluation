The Panel dismissed the credibility of the Applicant on the basis he provided two different stories at the port of entry and the hearing, and outlined in detail all of the contradictions in the testimony of the Applicant and vagueness in the testimony. However, the Panel’s credibility finding was related to the Applicant’s attempts to distance himself during the hearing from the content of his testimony at the port of entry. The Panel did not question the truthfulness of the Applicant’s admissions and statements at the port of entry.
