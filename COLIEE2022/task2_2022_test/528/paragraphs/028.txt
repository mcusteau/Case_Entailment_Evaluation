Thus, membership includes a person who merely belongs to a criminal organization. In making this determination, Justice Evans confirmed the finding of the trial judge. At paragraph 25, he restated the trial judgeâ€™s finding as follows:
As for the meaning of "member", the Judge held that, given the policy underlying paragraph 19(1)(c.2), the term "member" was not limited to a person who actively participated in criminal acts, or to one with a membership card whose name appeared on a membership list. Rather, it should be understood more broadly to mean simply a person who "belonged to" the criminal organization in question.
