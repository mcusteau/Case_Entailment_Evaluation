In reviewing the documentary evidence alone, it would appear that the gangs only moved into El Salvador en masse in the 1990s. There are several references to this deportation policy in the documentary evidence. The article by Crime and Justice International notes that the MS-13 street gang was not even formed in the United States until the late 1980s. The article by the National Alliance of Gang Investigators Associations that the gang was formed in Los Angeles in the late 1980s.This is also the testimony of Dr. Valdez, who testified in an earlier Honduran MS-13 case before the Immigration and Refugee Board. Dr. Valdez claims that MS-13 was well established in Honduras and other Central American countries by the middle part of the 1990s. The Maldon Institute states that the Maras originated in Los Angeles in the mid-1980s and that deportations were reported in “mid-1990s”. The Maldon Institute article specifies that the first wave of deportations to El Salvador began in 1993. However, the Immigration and Refugee Board research publication raises the possibility that deportations began during January 1990 (although that statement focuses on deportations of Salvadoran citizens in general). Finally, the article from Crime and Justice International notes that the gang has terrorized El Salvador since the end of the civil war in 1992. None of the documentary evidence provided specifies different dates during which time gangs began operating in different areas of the country, nor does any of the documentary evidence state that when the gangs initially formed they did not commit the same criminal acts as they had committed in the United States.
