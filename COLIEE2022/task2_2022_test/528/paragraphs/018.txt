However, in light of the documentary evidence, there is some concern with Mr. Alicea’s testimony. First, Mr. Alicea, clearly got the end date of the El Salvadoran civil war incorrect twice, a fact he only admitted in cross-examination. [see footnote 1] Second, he identified the wave of deportations as taking place in the early to mid-1980s, which was also clearly at odds with all of the documentary evidence. He admitted in cross-examination that he had no specific contacts in Usulutan, although he has contacts with the El Salvador National Police. He admitted if he needed information from the El Salvador police he would have to request the FBI to make contact with the El Salvador government. He stated he had not made these requests. Thus, Mr. Alicea’s evidence with respect to MS-13 in Usulutan, El Salvador does not seem to be as reliable as the Panel concluded, particularly given the importance of those two facts to the matter in issue.
