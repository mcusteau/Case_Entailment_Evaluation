On the other hand, the Panel found Mr. Alicea, a gang investigator with the New York State Police, who is knowledgeable about MS-13 and who testified at the hearing, to be entirely credible and determined that his evidence about MS-13 in El Salvador was also very probative. With respect to Mr. Alicea’s error in the date upon which the civil war in El Salvador ended, the Panel noted that “ […] he did correct this faux pas before his testimony ended. There was no hint or indication that he was trying to mislead this tribunal.” The Panel concluded that there was credible and trustworthy evidence to conclude that the MS-13 organization was believed on reasonable grounds to have engaged in criminal activities and that Mr. Amaya was a person described in paragraph 37(1)(a).
