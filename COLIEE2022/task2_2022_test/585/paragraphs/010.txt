The respondent's argument hinges on an interpretation of s. 18.1(3) which sees it as more limiting and restrictive, with respect to the court's authority on judicial review, than had existed under s. 52(d) and this limitation would apply not only to the Trial Division but also Appeal Division. I do not think the wording of s. 18.1(3) supports that conclusion. If anything, the wording of s. 18.1(3)(b) is broader than s. 52(d).
