The type of questions which the Court of Appeal asked itself were: is the evidence on the record so clearly conclusive that the only possible conclusion is that the claimant is a Convention refugee; is the sole issue to be decided a pure question of law which will be dispositive of the case; is the legal issue based on uncontroverted evidence and accepted facts; is there a factual issue which involves conflicting evidence which is central to the claim?
