I turn then to the question of when specific directions respecting a decision in a case should be given. The Federal Court of Appeal in
Punniamoorthy v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 166 N.R. 49, recently reviewed the cases in which it had exercised its authority under s. 53(c)(i) and declared an applicant to be a convention refugee. In my view, similar considerations are relevant in acceding to a request to give specific instructions to the C.R.D.D. with respect to an applicant.
