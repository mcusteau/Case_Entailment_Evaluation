In my view, there is jurisdiction pursuant to that provision to issue directions of such specificity that they require the C.R.D.D. to declare an applicant to be a Convention refugee. I note, firstly, that the wording of s. 18.1(3) is essentially the same as the wording of the former ss. 52(c) and 52(d) of the
Federal Court Act
. These stated:
"(former) s. 52 The Federal Court of Appeal may
. . . . .
(c) in the case of an appeal other than an appeal from the Trial Division
(i) dismiss the appeal or give the decision that should have been given, or
(ii) in its discretion,
refer the matter back for determination in accordance with such directions as it considers to be appropriate
; and
(d) in the case of an application to review and set aside a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal, either dismiss the application, set aside the decision or
set aside the decision and refer the matter back to the board, commission
or other tribunal
for determination in accordance with such directions as it considers to be appropriate
