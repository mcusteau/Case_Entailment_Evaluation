The Federal Court of Appeal interpreted s. 52(c) in
Orelien v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 1 F.C. 592; 135 N.R. 50 (F.C.A.) at p. 607:
"... if the court concludes the tribunal erred in any of the ways contemplated by subs. 28(1), by para. 52(c) of the
Federal Court Act
, it can only set aside the decision or set it aside and remit the matter to tribunal for reconsideration with directions. It cannot make the decision it thinks the tribunal ought to have made although,
from a practical point of view, its directions may be so precise as to dictate the result of the reconsideration
." (underlining added)
