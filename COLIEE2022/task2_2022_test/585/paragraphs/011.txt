As I understand the respondent's argument it is that the Trial Division's authority on judicial review has to be contrasted with the authority of the Appeal Division which exists on an appeal. For example s. 52(c)(i) of the
Federal Court Act
specifically provides that on an appeal, the Appeal Division may "dismiss the appeal or give the decision that should have been given". It is argued that there is no corresponding authority on judicial review and to interpret the power to give directions in s. 18.1(3) as including specific directions with respect to a particular decision would be to usurp authority not given under the statute.
