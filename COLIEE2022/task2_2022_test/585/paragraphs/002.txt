On January 18, 1994, I issued an order, on consent, quashing a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board ("C.R.D.D."). That decision had found the applicant not to be a Convention refugee. Counsel for the applicant asked that the matter be remitted back to the C.R.D.D. with specific instructions that the applicant should be declared to be a Convention refugee. The respondent questioned whether this court had jurisdiction to issue such directions. A decision on that issue was adjourned pending written representations from counsel. These were received on February 24, March 24 and April 6, 1994.
