The Board, in coming to its decision that a reasonable IFA existed in Colombo did not consider the reasonableness of the family unit, the applicant and her two children, residing there. The applicant gave evidence that her son and daughter had been accused of being members of the Tigers, when all three were initially detained by the police in Colombo. All three were detained when the applicant attempted to register them without having an I.D. card. The children were accused of having received training from the LTTE and all were accused of being in Colombo to obtain information for the LTTE. Her son was assaulted. Three days later, after they had been released, the son was again arrested, in a general roundup of young Tamil males. He was assaulted again. The Board in reaching its decision that the applicant was not likely to be persecuted in Colombo focused almost exclusively on the applicant's situation. It made the statement that she did not fit into the profile of a young Tamil female LTTE member but did not explain what that profile was. The Board focused its attention on the position of the applicant, particularly her age, and did not assess the likelihood of the children being the subject of persecution. I think this was an error which dictates that the Board's decision must be set aside.
