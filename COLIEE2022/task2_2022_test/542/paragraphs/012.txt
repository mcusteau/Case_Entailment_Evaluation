There is no quarrel with the Board's assertion that the factors identified in the UNHCR letter are not requirements. At the same time, the relevance of the factors which it identified and upon which it relied in reaching its conclusion is not obvious from the record. The relevance of the applicant's age to this second branch of the IFA assessment is not immediately obvious. Is the Board suggesting that she is young enough to establish herself in employment in that city? More importantly, what is meant by the Board when it refers to her social status is not explained. There is no discussion in the evidence, anywhere, of her social status insofar as Colombo is concerned. With respect to the reference to financial support from relatives living elsewhere, again, there is nothing in the evidence which indicates that she would receive financial assistance from others who lived elsewhere.
