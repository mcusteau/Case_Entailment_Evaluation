The applicant gave evidence that once her coconut plantation was confiscated she had no income. She gave evidence that she had never asked her siblings, who were living in Canada, for financial assistance because they were married and had their own families to support. She has no husband and her parents were not employed. It would appear that the Board made an assumption that her parents were wealthy and that they would support her and/or that she had independent wealth from other sources.
