The most important conclusion of the Board was that the two alleged arrests and detention of Mr. Sinan were fabricated by the Applicants. This conclusion, explained in comprehensive reasons, was based on the Board's numerous adverse credibility findings. This conclusion can only be erroneous, in my opinion, if the cumulative effect of the Board's credibility findings on which it is based is patently unreasonable. As noted above, the test is not whether I would have rejected or accepted the testimony of Mr. Sinan, but whether the conclusion of the Board is patently unreasonable. In my view, it is not.
