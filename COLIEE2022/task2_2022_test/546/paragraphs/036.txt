In so concluding, Russell J. relied on a decision made by Mr. Justice Douglas Campbell in the case of
Mahmud v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 167 F.T.R. 309. In that case, the issue was not a complete absence of evidence as in
Mui
but rather a situation like that in the present in which letters submitted by the Applicant contradicted his evidence not because of what they said but because of what they omitted. In deciding
Mahmud
, Justice Campbell relied on
Maldonado v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1980] 2 F.C. 302 (C.A.) and
Ahortor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
(1993), 65 F.T.R. 137 (T.D.).
