I am satisfied that the Visa Officer did not commit a reviewable error in assessing the educational qualifications of the Applicant's spouse, having regard to the combined effect of section 73, subparagraph 78(2)(d)(ii), paragraph 83(1)(a) and paragraph 83(2)(b) of the Regulations. This means that even if she erred in assessing the evidence with respect to the Applicant's father, the Applicant is still short of the necessary number of points to qualify for the issuance of a permanent residence visa.
