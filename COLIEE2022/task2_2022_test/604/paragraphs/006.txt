The Applicant challenges the decision with reference made pursuant to the Act and the IRPA Regulations. He argues that the Visa Officer erred by failing to award units of assessment under the adaptability factor when there was evidence before her to justify the award of points in that regard. In this regard, the Applicant refers to the evidence that his father is a permanent resident in Canada. He argues that this fact should have led the Visa Officer to award 5 points.
