In her affidavit, the Visa Officer said the following:
The Applicant's spouse was not given credit for any education beyond her completion of Grade 12. Her IMM8 application form refers to completion of Grade 12 and two years of study towards a B.A. The Applicant's spouse did not identify any other educational qualifications in her IMM8 form. Partial completion of a Bachelor's degree does not entitle an application [sic] to any additional points. At the interview, I reviewed the IMM8 forms with the Applicant and his spouse to confirm that the education and other information was accurate. The Applicant's spouse did not mention that she had any additional educational qualifications. I have reviewed our file and it does not appear that the Applicant submitted any document showing any additional educational qualifications for his wife. The Applicant did not refer me to any such document during the interview.
