The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the "Respondent") filed an affidavit from the Visa Officer in response to this application for judicial review. The Visa Officer deposed that she was not satisfied with the evidence submitted by the Applicant relating to the presence of his father in Canada. She also deposed that the Applicant's wife was not entitled to credit for any education beyond completion of grade 12 since two years of study towards a B.A. "does not entitle an application [sic] to any additional points".
