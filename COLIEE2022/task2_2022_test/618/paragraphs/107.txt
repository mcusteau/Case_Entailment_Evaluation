Once it has been proven that a tort has been committed by a servant of the Crown, it remains for the plaintiff to establish that the tort was committed in the course of the servant's employment. The jurisprudence with respect to the liability of a master for the actions of its servants is canvassed in the case of
Crown Diamond Paint Co. Ltd. v. The Queen
, [1980] 2 F.C. 794. Dubé, J., states, at page 799:
"Learned counsel for the defendant claimed that a master is not responsible for damage by his servant when the latter is not acting within the scope of duty but on a 'frolic of his own'. She quoted a number of authorities on the subject. As I pointed out to her at the hearing, it used to be that a bailee was not responsible for the loss of property by the theft of his own servant, unless the bailee had given occasion for the theft by his own negligence, or by that of some other of his servants employed to take care of the property. However, the Court of Appeal has now held in
Morris v. C.W. Martin and Sons Ltd.
, [1966] 1 Q.B. 716, at p. 737, that the responsibility of the bailee must depend on whether the servant by whom the theft is committed is one to whom the charge or custody of the thing stolen has been entrusted by his master. In other words, if such a servant steals the thing entrusted to him, he is acting nevertheless in the course of his employment. He is doing fraudulently what he is employed to do honestly. In
Morris v. C.W. Martin and Sons Ltd.
, a firm of cleaners to whom a furrier had sent the plaintiff's mink stole were found liable for the theft of the stole by an employee whose duty it was to clean it.
"It is a question of fact whether the employment merely provided an opportunity for the theft, or was part of the task on which the servant was engaged.
"A master will not get off his liability merely because his servant was temporarily going on a frolic of his own. The question is whether the activity was reasonably incidental to the performance of his authorized duties, or involved so substantial a departure that the servant must be regarded as a stranger vis-à-vis his master."
