The plaintiff viewed this letter as a personal reprimand and a partial blame for the situation. She wrote to Mr. Klaubert on November 14 and stated:
"The purpose of this letter is to express in general terms conditions in the work environment here and to relate some of the affects of these circumstances. I am also asserting here my right to make the most of life and the fact that I am acting in defense of that right.
"The new office arrangements are much improved and very much appreciated. Nevertheless, I am still subject to and vulnerable to harassment and vulnerable to my responses to these pressures. Because I must cope with unexpected and unpredictable adverse behaviour on the part of the liaison officer, because I must be able to record these incidents as accurately as possible, because I have no witnesses (and little other human contact during the day other than with the liaison officer), I find myself chronically in a state of fear and expanded awareness, functioning daily at concert pitch, with corresponding alterations in my personality being manifested in defensiveness and other signs of distress. Another facet of this is the increased vulnerability to pain which I am experiencing; however, I am very resourceful and am getting some help and support. By far not the least of that support has come from you and the actions of your administration and I am indeed grateful. But I remain feeling insecure and overly aroused often for long periods of time because it often appears there is nothing to stop the liaison officer from doing practically anything hurtful he wishes, and I would have no witness to back up my account of the problem, in spite of your assurances that you are watching this situation carefully. I do recognize your faithfulness however. Some difficulties have arisen because I am also dependent for information from you as my supervisor, and I am often not sure where I stand on issues when no results are forthcoming at this end. Negative motives have also been misapplied to me while defensive statements are made on the liaison officer's behalf. I will grant that some innuendo and nuance have affected both sides in our discourse, leaving me with the acknowledgment, which I graciously extend to you, that forgiveness has been generous and genuinely given. Such difficulties are inevitable when trying to cope with these particular circumstances and problems. It is because of the possibility of inadvertent and unintended communications breakdowns and their affects that I am confirming a change in our communication pattern which I discussed with you by telephone. I will therefore recapitulate: Frequently the liaison officer is on the phone making reports which may or may not be associated with a particular incident. He is, however, very quick in calling following
any
encounter with me. His reports must be recorded or at least assessed by you in some manner. Knowing this, I then feel compelled to enter my part in the record, especially if I think there has been a problem or conflict or whatever. It is very unnerving though to have every move monitored when the originator of the report is not a person who's judgment I would trust. (However, if this is necessary, I can live with it.) Also, some of the situations connect to other situations indirectly and/or sequentially by context and there may be a myriad of details which are not included. You have always received my calls fairly and welcomed them, but I am sure this reporting by telephone is destructive to our otherwise very good rapport, having a compounding effect on the problem. I am also sure, despite your brave efforts, this must be extremely difficult to you and hard to deal with. I will, therefore, not be calling you to discuss the difficulties in the future, unless there is an emergency. You will get my reports in writing. Of course I will call every day to discuss other matters, as you suggested, and I hope any distortion in our efforts or apprehensions will be avoided.
"I wish to acknowledge and agree with your emphasis that as much progress as possible must be made on my particular work plan project. There is nothing I would like better than to see an end to the diversions caused by my need to submit reports, to engage in additional communications, to visit the nurse, and to ponder over futile problems which were entirely avoidable. The project you have assigned is interesting, providing me with daily discoveries; it is also peaceful and enjoyable and I am thankful to have it."
