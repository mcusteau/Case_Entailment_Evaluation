Mr. Stalinski struck me as an authoritative man, paternalistic and even military in his approach to those falling under his authority. He repeated on numerous occasions that he would deal with the plaintiff in the same way he would with his children and that she, like them, should accept his authority, experience and wisdom. He was accurately described by counsel for the defendant as "a man who had his problems". He is also a keen and astute observer of human nature and was able to discern plaintiff's emotional fragility from a brief employment interview.
