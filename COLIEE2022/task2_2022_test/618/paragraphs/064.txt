In light of the intensity of this exchange and its potential repercussions, Mr. Stalinski recorded this event. In a memorandum to Mr. Klaubert, he states:
"Boothman was not in the office 84-12-31 during the hours that I am usually here. I received a report that she was in the Passport Office at approximately 16:10 on the second date noted above. At that time she made numerous references to the bruises that she had on her body -- bruises I assume that she obtained as a result of trying to break down doors, while implying that I was the person or think that had inflicted them upon her. She apparently went on to ask if nobody cared what happened in the offices next door, and warned that it was only a matter of time before something terribly serious happened there, and they obviously didn't care.
"Boothman then said something along the lines that she was looking for the nice lady in blue that helped her on the previous Friday. The woman she was referring to was seen hovering solicitously over Boothman after she had begun to calm down on the first noted date. As a result of the solicitousness exhibited by the woman, Boothman recommenced her wailing and extremely abusive behaviour, prolonging the outrage. I entered the area and instructed the woman to leave inasmuch as she was in a restricted area without authorization. The woman did so, but categorically refused to identify herself."
