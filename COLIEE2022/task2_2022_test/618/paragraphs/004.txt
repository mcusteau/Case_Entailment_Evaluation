COGLA is a branch of both the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources (hereafter E.M.R.) and the Department of Indian Affairs. Its administrator reported to the Deputy Ministers of both departments. COGLA was created in 1981 by bringing together employees of both departments (some 120 in total) in order to administer the National Energy Program. The final implementation of COGLA was completed in 1985.
