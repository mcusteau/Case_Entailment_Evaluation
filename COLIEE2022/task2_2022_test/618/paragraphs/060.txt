On December 11, plaintiff wrote to Mr. Klaubert. Plaintiff had not accepted Mr. Klaubert's earlier criticism of her. The letter was written with a view of reestablishing her working relationship with Mr. Klaubert. The body of the letter reads:
"I think it is wrong for us to subtly hurt one another through the use of an official file, especially since this is in blatant contradiction to our verbal interactions.
"If you will forgive me for not being able to attend to my work plan project duties (while reporting harassment and other difficulties) at the Calgary office, I will forgive you for reprimanding and criticising me in writing for the said perceived neglect.
"I do not want or need your sympathy. Our joy will be full in your charity. My compliments of the Season!"
