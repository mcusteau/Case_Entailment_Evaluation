[63]
Later that morning, the plaintiff and Mr. Stalinski got into another heated argument. The plaintiff was approaching Mr. Stalinski's office when he got up and slammed the door in her face, knocking the plaintiff down. When she got up and opened the door, Mr. Stalinksi forced the door closed on her and once again the plaintiff was knocked to the floor. Upon seeing this, a passerby in the hallway came to the plaintiff's assistance, helping her up from the floor. Seeing this, Mr. Stalinski pulled the lady's hand from the plaintiff's arm, told her that she was in a restricted area and ordered her out of the premises. When the plaintiff got up, she went to get the cart. Mr. Stalinski ordered her to leave it alone and grabbed the other end. A tug-of-war ensured and Mr. Stalinski eventually jerked the cart with force from the plaintiff's hands.
