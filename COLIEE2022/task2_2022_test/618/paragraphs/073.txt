In August of 1984, the plaintiff was responsible for bringing to Ottawa's attention a number of serious deficiencies in Mr. Stalinski's management style. These complaints ultimately led to the financial and administrative audit which culminated in findings of impropriety. The seriousness of this investigation and of its conclusions is evidenced by a note entitled "Disciplinary Interview With T. Stalinski Wednesday October 3, 1984", which reads in part:
"... stated that the reason for meeting was to resolve serious problems of carrying on personal business, wilful nonperformance of duties, inflating workload statistics and improper behaviour. T. Stalinski interjected to say that he was willing in general to accept that this was the case.
. . . . .
"D. Sherwin discussed the wilful neglect of duties by T. Stalinski. Specifically he mentioned the failure to put in 7Â½ hours each day and the failure to send 18 boxes of confidential material to Headquarters and actually deny having them. He pointed out that the latter had created embarrassment because the companies had insisted that the information had been sent and we said that it was never received. Now an apology had to be made. T. Stalinski agreed that he had not done what he should have but did not offer an explanation when asked. Later he said he had withheld the information because he was unhappy with the job. When he realized the seriousness of the matter, he could not bring himself to send the material because it was embarrassing. Prior to the formation of COGLA he viewed his job as primarily one of liaising with industry on the technical aspects of the metrification program. He did not see data management as his primary role.
"D. Sherwin also went into detail on the lack of filing of correspondence to which T. Stalinski replied that he did not see any purpose in keeping piles of paper. He added that DIAND had told him to destroy this correspondence. D. Sherwin pointed out that it was essential to keep good records including those on who came to the office and what was examined. T. Stalinski said that he was never asked to keep a log.
"D. Sherwin told T. Stalinski that the operational audit had suggested that the workload statistics had been misleading. T. Stalinski stated that this was not so. He said that there had been far less work lately because there are quiet periods from time to time. As the discussion progressed T. Stalinski admitted that there has been a general fall-off in the workload over the past two years.

"Sherwin also said that in his view T. Stalinski's behaviour was a clear case of harassment. When T. Stalinski asked for instances, he cited the example of T. Stalinski ordering L. Boothman out of the public view room in front of a client. When L. Boothman asked for instructions on how to fill a reader-printer with paper. He also cited the reports of verbal threats. These were not denied but in his defence T. Stalinski stated that L. Boothman took his comments out of context. D. Sherwin gave him the Treasury Booklet on Harassment, asked him to read it, told him that harassment was very seriously and could lead to dismissal."
