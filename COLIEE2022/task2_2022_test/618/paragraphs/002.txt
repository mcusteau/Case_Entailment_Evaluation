In an amended statement of claim filed with leave of this court, the plaintiff also claims that other named and unnamed Crown servants were negligent in failing to take the necessary steps to restrain and prevent Mr. Stalinski from committing or continuing to commit the alleged acts. This latter claim was attacked by counsel for the defendant as being barred by statute. For the reasons which appeal in the last part of this judgment, I have come to the conclusion that the cause of action raised by the amended statement of claim is separate and distinct from that raised by the original claim and was barred by statute at the time it was raised.
