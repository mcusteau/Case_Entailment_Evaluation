On November 26, while the plaintiff was using the photocopying machine, Mr. Stalinski walked up directly behind her and stood there for some time within very close proximity. The plaintiff recorded this event in a note to Mr. Klaubert indicating that she had found this behaviour intimidating. Later, on November 29, Mr. Stalinski was found to have been listening in on the plaintiff's telephone conversations.
