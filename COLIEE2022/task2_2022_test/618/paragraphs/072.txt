The structure of the COGLA office in Calgary and its distance from Ottawa and the senior management allowed Mr. Stalinski almost complete autonomy in the running of the office. Prior to September 1984, visits to the Calgary office from Ottawa management barely took place. The evidence indicates that Mr. Stalinski had come to consider the COGLA office in Calgary as his own and that he used it for his personal locksmithing business. He had very set ways in the manner in which he ran the office and in the performance of his supervisory functions. He cherished his authority and autonomy and he was most concerned about any event which could provoke the intrusion of senior management in Ottawa into his style of management.
