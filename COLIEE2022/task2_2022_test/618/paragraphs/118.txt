It has been authoritatively held in this country that there is jurisdiction to award punitive damages or exemplary damages where a defendant deliberately exposes the plaintiff to risk without justification (See
McElroy v. Cowper-Smith
, [1967] S.C.R. 425;
H.L. Weiss Forwarding Ltd. v. Omnus
, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 776; 5 N.R. 511.). Indeed, it does not appear that exemplary damages need be specifically pleaded in order for the court to exercise this jurisdiction. In
Starkman v. Delhi Court Ltd.
, [1961] O.R. 467 (C.A.), McGillvray, J.A., said:
"In the present case the award was of a lump sum of $5,000. In claims of this nature it is not the practice to allow a separate and distinct sum for punitive damages but such, when the circumstances justify it, may be taken into account in the overall assessment. As they are not to be assessed separately there is no compelling necessity that they should be specifically claimed."
