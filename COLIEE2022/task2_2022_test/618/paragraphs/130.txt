A review of the massive amount of documentary evidence emanating from the plaintiff and generated at the time when the relevant events took place indicates that plaintiff, from the very beginning, held the belief that she had been wronged by the inappropriateness of the actions of senior management. Quite clearly her main contention was with the actions of Mr. Stalinski, but it is clear that she was most mindful of what she viewed as the failings of senior management at the time when the original action was launched in July of 1986. I therefore cannot accept that plaintiff only became aware of this additional cause of action in September of 1992.
