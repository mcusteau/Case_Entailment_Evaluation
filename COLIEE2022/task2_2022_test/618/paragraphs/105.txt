Catzman, J., then went on to postulate the requirements for establishing the tort of intentional infliction of nervous shock. At page 140, he enumerates those requirements as follows:
"(i) An overt act, whether physical, verbal or both by the plaintiff.
"(ii) Intent by the defendant* to do that act or to speak those words.
"(iii) Circumstances which would lead a reasonable person in the position of the defendant to foresee a reasonable likelihood of fear or emotional upset on the part of the plaintiff ...
"(iv) Actual harm amounting to nervous shock - i.e., going beyond the kind of emotional upset needed to satisfy element (iii) ... and going beyond, in many instances, the limits of reasonable prevision."
(* In the reported case the sentence reads: "Intent by the
plaintiff
to do that act or speak those words". It is obvious that this should read "Intent by the
defendant
" and therefore I have taken the liberty of writing it as such in the above quote.)
