On September 12, Mr. Stewart began reviewing the plaintiff's complaint to the Human Rights Commission and came to the conclusion that there had been mismanagement and that instances of harassment had indeed occurred. He was also convinced that the plaintiff had emotional and psychiatric problems. This condition had become apparent to him from the moment he became involved. As a result of these findings, Mr. Stewart recommended that a financial and operations audit be conducted, and that alternative arrangements for the supervision of the plaintiff be implemented.
