Mr. Stalinski was without supervision. He had ultimate authority to hire, and exercised that authority in a wrongful manner. He was the sole authority in a two person office and, after having been placed in that position by his employer, he used that authority to inflict upon plaintiff mental pain and suffering, to harass her, intimidate her, interfere with her, and on occasion assault her. He was placed in this position notwithstanding the fact that Mr. Sherwin and other senior officials of COGLA knew him to be a difficult individual, abrasive in his behaviour, evasive vis-Ã -vis his responsibilities, and prone to losses of temper.
