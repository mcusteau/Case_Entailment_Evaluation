The sole factor militating against that award lies in the fact that, at the relevant time, plaintiff refused to accept the offers of medical assistance extended by the COGLA officials. Plaintiff argued that she was justified in refusing this assistance because she did not trust psychiatrists. This may be so, but, in assessing damages, the court must look objectively at the means which were made available to plaintiff to minimize or contain the damages from which she now suffers. In not responding to the offers of medical assistance, she failed in her duty to minimize her damages.
