The plaintiff began working at COGLA on July 9, 1984. The Calgary office is located in the Harry Hayes Building and is one of many federal public service offices in the building. Throughout the relevant period, plaintiff and Mr. Stalinski worked alone in these premises. The office was at the time in a most squalid state. It was filthy to the point where mouse excrement could be found all over the piles of dirty dishes left in the kitchen. Mr. Stalinski had been content leaving the office in that condition. One of the tasks which plaintiff undertook at the beginning of her term of employment was to bring the office to a reasonable state of cleanliness.
