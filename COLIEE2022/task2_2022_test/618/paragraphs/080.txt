After her experience at COGLA, plaintiff had two other employments, neither of which she was able to hold. She was first a library assistant, a position which she quit when she found that she could not cope with her supervisor. She quit her second job as coordinatory of cultural resources for the City of Calgary after five months. The plaintiff claims that she was subjected to a traumatizing experience of sexual harassment during almost the full period of this last employment. Plaintiff continues to be unemployed to this day.
