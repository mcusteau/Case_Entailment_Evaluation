[122]
In view of all the evidence, I award the following:
1. For damages suffered as a result of the intentional infliction of nervous shock, the sum of $5,000 for pain and suffering and $20,000 for loss of future earnings.
2. For pain and suffering as a result of the assaults on her person, the sum of $5,000.
3. Given the reprehensible conduct of Mr. Stalinski, his outrageous and unacceptable behaviour towards the plaintiff, the fact that the sum of $30,000 is inadequate for the purpose of deterrence, I would add to that amount the sum of $10,000 as exemplary damages.
