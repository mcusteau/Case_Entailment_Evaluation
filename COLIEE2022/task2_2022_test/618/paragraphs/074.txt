Mr. Stalinski was very prone to using violent language and his use of such language towards the plaintiff gradually increased as the plaintiff showed her determination to resist his attempts to control and dominate her. Examples of this type of verbal abuse were related to Mr. Klaubert on several occasions. Indeed, in November 1984, Mr. Stalinski admitted to Mr. Klaubert that "I am so mad at that woman I could kill her", and "I am not putting up with this bitch for one more minute", and again that "I cannot bear much more of this before I will wring her neck gently, between my hands until all life has ceased". Mr. Stalinski also stated on prior occasions that he wanted to shove his fist down plaintiff's throat, that he would break her fingers, that he would rip off her lips, that he would break her arm and that he would bash her head in. Mr. Stalinski's attitude with regard to these threats is that he had no intention to carry them out, but that just uttering them made him feel better.
