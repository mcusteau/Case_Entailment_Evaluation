Mr. Stalinski's language and actions towards plaintiff grew progressively more violent as plaintiff showed her determination to resist his attempts to dominate her. He intentionally assaulted the plaintiff on numerous occasions by wilfully creating an apprehension of immediate harmful or offensive contact and, on one occasion, resorting to direct force against the plaintiff thereby causing bodily harm. In addition, Mr. Stalinski humiliated, insulted, manipulated and harassed the plaintiff at every turn. He exploited her and succeeded in destroying the plaintiff's self-esteem. He intended to cause her harm and succeeded in that attempt. The damage resulting from these actions is psychological in nature and includes depression and anxiety attacks, feelings of suicidal despair and social isolation.
