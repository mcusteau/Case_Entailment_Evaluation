"... that Ms. Boothman's predominant symptoms centre around the following:
(a) A preoccupation and obsession with thoughts pertaining to the work place events that culminated in her dismissal from the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources.

(b) Emotional ability often including tearfulness, despair and anger in response to what she perceives as an unfair situation.
(c) Depressive symptomatology, including elements of hopelessness."
