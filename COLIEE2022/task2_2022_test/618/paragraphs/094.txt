There can be no doubt that the plaintiff suffered from psychological and emotional difficulties prior to her experience with COGLA and during her tenure, she exhibited behaviour consistent with this state. Her emotional insecurity was particularly apparent in her dealings with Mr. Klaubert. Plaintiff seized on Mr. Klaubert's efforts to assist her and made advances to him. As discussed earlier, her letter to him wherein she states, "Our joy will be full in your charity" is evidence of plaintiff's difficulties in relationships.
