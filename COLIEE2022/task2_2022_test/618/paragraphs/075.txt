The most troublesome part of this course of action is that, on occasion, these threats were made while Mr. Stalinski was brandishing a screwdriver in the proximity of plaintiff's face or while a hammer lay sitting on his desk. Mr. Stalinski was well aware of the fact that plaintiff feared for her physical safety and that the presence of tools in the office was having a traumatizing effect on her. In a conversation with Mr. Klaubert which the latter reflected in a subsequent memorandum, he said that he was purposely leaving tools around the office, such as a utility knife, to irritate plaintiff.
