In
Rahemtulla v. Vanfed Credit Union
(1984), 29 C.C.L.T. 78 (B.C.S.C.), Madame Justice McLachlin, while sitting as a Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, accepted the rule laid down in
Wilkinson v. Downton
as the foundation for the tort. In that case, the plaintiff was a bank teller who, as a result of being wrongfully accused of stealing money, suffered mental suffering.
