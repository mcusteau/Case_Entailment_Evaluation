In the case at hand, Mr. Stalinski was placed by his employer in a special position of trust. As Mr. Sherwin, Director General, Resource Evaluation Branch, stated in the disciplinary letter written to Stalinski on October 26, 1984:
"You must realize that, due to the fact that the Calgary Office is removed from direct Headquarters supervision, you are in a special position of trust in terms of doing your job and conducting yourself in a manner that reflects well on COGLA, and on you as an employee."
