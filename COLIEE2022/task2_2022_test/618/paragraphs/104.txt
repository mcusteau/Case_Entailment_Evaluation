In
Timmermans v. Buelow et al.
(1984), 38 C.C.L.T. 136 (Ont. H.C.J.), the court found that the rule in
Wilkinson v. Downton
applied where the defendant, who had knowledge of the plaintiff's fragile emotional state, assisted in obtaining his unlawful eviction. As a result, the plaintiff suffered serious psychological trauma. In this case, Catzman, J., thoroughly canvassed the rule in
Wilkinson v. Downton
and distinguished the tort of intentional infliction of nervous shock from that of assault. At page 138, he states:
"To start with, the
Wilkinson
principle is clearly distinguishable in function from the tort of assault. While this is no place for an exhaustive catalogue of the distinctions, I would offer the following:
(a) In assault, the apprehension felt by a plaintiff must be of imminent and unwelcome physical contact to
himself
. In
Wilkinson
cases, that
may
be so, but typically is not. Thus, Mrs. Wilkinson was afraid only for her husband's safety, as was Mrs. Purdy in her case: while Mademoiselle Janvier's fear was not of physical contact at all, any more than Miss Rahemtulla's was; and poor old Mrs. Bielitski was stricken with unnecessary grief for her supposedly dead son, rather than any fear for herself.
(b) Assault is commonly held, upon the somewhat shaky authority ... to be an essentially physical tort, necessarily involving some physical gesture and thus incapable of being committed by words alone. In contrast, the tort committed in
Wilkinson
cases is typically ... entirely verbal ...
(c) In one respect, the
Wilkinson
tort, generally complementary to assault, is narrower that the latter tort. For in assault, a plaintiff need only show 'apprehension', the slightest emotional disquiet or annoyance being apparently enough. In
Wilkinson v. Downton
cases, by contrast, the plaintiff is compelled to show a devastating trauma to the nervous system sufficient in law to amount to that unscientific notion of 'nervous shock'."
