[45]
It was decided that, given the fact that no prior documented evidence of misbehaviour existed with respect to Mr. Stalinski, the only appropriate action was to give him an oral reprimand. Mr. Stewart and others travelled to Calgary for the purpose of giving the oral reprimand and to apologize to the plaintiff. This was done on October 3, in the course of separate meetings. Both the plaintiff and Mr. Stalinski were also informed that a new financial, operational and supervisory arrangement was being implemented.
