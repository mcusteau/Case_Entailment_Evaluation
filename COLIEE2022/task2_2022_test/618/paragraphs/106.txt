[106]
In the case at hand, Mr. Stalinski, as had the defendant in the
Timmermans
case, acted in the knowledge of plaintiff's condition, but the distinguishing feature is that he deliberately exploited her condition with the view of bringing her to collapse mentally and quit her job. Not only was there general wilful injuria of the
Wilkinson
type, but there was also the malicious purpose to cause the plaintiff to breakdown mentally. There is accordingly no issue of remoteness or foreseeability in the present case, nor is there any question as to whether the actions of Mr. Stalinski would have caused nervous shock to a normal person. When a person knowingly exploits another's emotional and mental vulnerability thereby causing a severe and lasting mental breakdown, it is no answer to state that a normal person would not have been so adversely affected.
