In the case at hand, the actions of Mr. Stalinski took plaintiff from a fragile emotional state, which was noted by Mr. Stalinski at the time she was hired, to a state of mental collapse and severe nervous depression, the impact of which she continues to exhibit some seven years after the fact. In terms of damages, it matters little, in the circumstances of this case, that plaintiff had a predisposition as it has been shown that it is the wilful exploitation of that predisposition which caused the damages for which she is now seeking compensation.
