It is my opinion that the Board did not err by determining that the applicant did not face a particularized risk upon his return. Because section 97 does not require a nexus between the fear and Convention grounds, it may appear to be a more promising route by which the applicant may be granted asylum. However, as discussed above, the risk faced by the applicant is generalized. The risk of violence is one which every person in Haiti faces. The documentary evidence submitted in support of this case indicates that there is a serious risk to the personal safety of all in Haiti. The High Commissioner of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) has recommended the suspension of forced returns to Haiti.
