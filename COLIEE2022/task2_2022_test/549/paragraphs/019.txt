The harm feared is criminal in nature, and has no nexus to the Convention refugee definition. In a recent decision
Étienne v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2007] F.C.J. No. 99 (QL), 2007 FC 64, Justice Shore dealt with the argument that wealth constitutes a particular social group:
[15]
Mr. Étienne's allegation, that the Board erred when it determined, that his claim provided no nexus to a Convention ground as required under section 96 of IRPA, is unfounded. The Board was justified in concluding that gaining wealth or winning a lottery does not constitute membership in a particular social group.
[16] In
Moali de Sanchez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2001 FCT 183, [2001] F.C.J. No. 375, Justice Yvon Pinard rejected the extended interpretation of the concept of a social group:
[6] I also find that the RD's second conclusion is free of error. In
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the extended interpretation of the concept of a social group.
The status of a landed proprietor does not in any way fall within the "general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination"
(
Ward, supra
, at 739) and is not a "characteristic of personhood not alterable by conscious action and in some cases not alterable except on the basis of unacceptable costs" (
Ward, supra
, at 738). The tribunal also referred to
Wilcox v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, November 2, 1993, [1993] F.C.J. No. 1157, A-1282-92, in which Reed J. found as follows at paras. [3]:
I interpret the Tribunal's decision as finding that there was no evidence that the Peruvian upper middle class is subject to any greater level of (what the Tribunal referred to as) depredation than others in Peruvian society generally.
I interpret the Tribunal's decision as finding that the Sendero Luminosa are raining terror on everyone in Peru. While the type of danger which the applicants fear (extortion) may only be operative against the rich, this does not mean that the applicants have been or will be subject to persecution in the convention refugee sense.
