While I appreciate the additional dimension that the applicant has brought to the submission by arguing that a person's past cannot be changed, I cannot accept the applicant's argument. The passage from
Ward, above
relied upon by the applicant, is discussed in the context of social groups being limited and informed by anti-discrimination notions. The Supreme Court also writes in
Ward,
above at para. 64:
[...] In distilling the contents of the head of "particular social group", therefore, it is appropriate to find inspiration in discrimination concepts. Hathaway,
supra
, at pp. 135-36, explains that the anti-discrimination influence in refugee law is justified on the basis of those sought to be protected thereby:
The early refugee accords did not articulate this notion of disfranchisement or breakdown of basic membership rights, since refugees were defined simply by specific national, political, and religious categories, including anti-Communist Russians, Turkish Armenians, Jews from Germany, and others. The de facto uniting criterion, however, was the shared marginalization of the groups in their states of origin, with consequent inability to vindicate their basic human rights at home. These early refugees were not merely suffering persons, but were moreover persons whose position was fundamentally at odds with the power structure in their home state. It was the lack of a meaningful stake in the governance of their own society which distinguished them from others, and which gave legitimacy to their desire to seek protection abroad.
