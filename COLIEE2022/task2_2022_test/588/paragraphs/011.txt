The applicant also takes issue with the assessment of the facts by the IRB. After reviewing the evidence, I am of the view that the panel provided clear and unequivocal reasons regarding the lack of credibility of the applicant's story and the rejection of his claim for refugee protection. Generally, the decision of the IRB is based on the evidence adduced, draws reasonable inferences from it and respects the relevant legal principles. None of the applicant's submissions establish that the IRB made a patently unreasonable error, or made erroneous or arbitrary findings of fact or disregarded the evidence before it. Therefore, the intervention of this Court is not warranted.
