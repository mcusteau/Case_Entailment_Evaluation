It was clearly within the Applicantâ€™s control to know or find out whether his 2012 visa had been refused. He says now that he completely forgot to mention this application but is certain about the dates when he did follow up on it and the information he was given in 2013 and 2014. The Applicant is a sophisticated businessman and had experience with immigration procedures in Canada and elsewhere. He could have followed up on the status of the 2012 visa application again, or mentioned in his TRV application that he was unsure of its status. It is difficult to accept that in 2017 and 2018 he could have believed that the application was still in progress.
