As a preliminary matter, I would note that the Applicant submitted an affidavit for the purpose of this judicial review that contains information that was not before the Officer when he made his decision. I accept that the affidavit is admissible under the test in Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada v Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 FCA 22 at paras 19â€“20. It provides context regarding the Applicant's knowledge (or lack thereof) of his prior US visa refusals which is therefore relevant to his arguments that his misrepresentation was innocent and that he was denied procedural fairness.
