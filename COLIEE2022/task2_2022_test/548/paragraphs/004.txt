In December 2017, the Officer sent the Applicant a procedural fairness letter indicating that he had been untruthful when he declared in his application that he had never been refused a visa to any country. The letter asked that the Applicant provide information related to this allegation and advised that he could face a five-year ban for misrepresentation. In his response, the Applicant first explained that he had forgotten to declare that he mistakenly crossed into the United States at the Niagara border after taking a wrong turn in 2016. The Applicant indicated that he was uncertain whether this constituted a “refusal.” Shortly thereafter, he sent a second response stating that he had just remembered he was refused a US visa in 2015 due to “insufficient ties in Canada.”
