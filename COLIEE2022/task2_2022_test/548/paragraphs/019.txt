The test for the innocent misrepresentation exception is whether an applicant can show that they honestly and reasonably believed that they were not withholding material information. This involves (i) a subjective test, where the decision-maker must ask whether the “person honestly believed that he is not making a misrepresentation”; and (ii) an objective test, where the decision-maker must ask whether “it was reasonable on the facts that the person believed that he was not making a misrepresentation”: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Robinson, 2018 FC 159 at para 6.
