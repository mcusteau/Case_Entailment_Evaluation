As for whether the Officer’s reasons for decision were sufficient, a visa officer has a minimal duty to give reasons for a denied TRV application, as long as the reviewing court can understand why the officer made the decision: Zhou v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 465 at para 21; Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 621 at para 9. In this case, the reasons, while succinct, are adequate to explain why the application was denied.
