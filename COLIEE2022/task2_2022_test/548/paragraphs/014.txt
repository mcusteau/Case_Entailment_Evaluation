As stated by Justice LeBlanc in Tuiran v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 324 at paragraph 14, the duty of procedural fairness owed to a TRV applicant is on the lower end of the spectrum, even if the TRV is sought in conjunction with an application for permanent residence or concerns of misrepresentations were raised during the processing of the application. This is so, Justice LeBlanc explained, because the person affected – a non-citizen – has no right to enter or remain in Canada and faces neither detention nor removal from Canada. Also, decisions dismissing TRV applications filed from abroad by foreign nationals are highly discretionary and the consequences for failed applicants, although they may be serious, do not normally engage their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982, c 11.
