The Applicant submits that he falls under the innocent error exception. His situation, he argues, is similar to the applicants in Punia at para 6 and to those described in Berlin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1117 [Berlin]. As he only learned of the 2013 refusal when he received reasons in this judicial review application, he could not have declared the refusal on his forms or in his response to the procedural fairness letter. Similar to Medel, the Applicant contends, he honestly and reasonably believed that he was not withholding information regarding his US visa refusal in 2013.
