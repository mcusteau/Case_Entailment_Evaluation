Section 76(3) contemplates a two-part assessment, the first of points and the second relative to settlement funds or an award of points pursuant to section 82(2) of the Regulations. It authorizes an officer to exercise a discretion "whether or not the skilled worker has been awarded the minimum number of points", pursuant to section 76(1) [emphasis added]. I reject the Respondent's arguments that the exercise of discretion, or in current parlance a "substituted evaluation", is held only relative to the assessment of points.
