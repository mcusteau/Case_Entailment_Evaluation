In the present case, the Visa Officer was cross-examined upon his affidavit that was filed as part of the Respondent's application record. He was later questioned by counsel for the Respondent about his failure to consider settlement funds and said as follows:
"Q. And in that paragraph, you talk about how you didn't consider the issue of settlement funds prior to refusing the application. And that along with RPRF and settlement funds, those are some of the last things requested by a visa officer.
Can you tell me why you didn't require any sort of proof of settlement funds in order to make your decision on August 5th?
A. To repeat what I've written, yes, I usually assess proof of funds at the end of the process of assessing an application for immigration to Canada or for permanent residence in Canada.
The reason it takes place at the end of the assessment - - the end of the process than at the beginning is because most people - - most applicants simply do not have sufficient liquid assets - - cash, available to them at the beginning of the process. And quite often, for many of our applicants, they are required to sell property, sell a vehicle, sell a house, even, in order to show that they have sufficient liquid assets.
Now, it would be unfair of me to require that they do so, that they sell their property at the beginning of a process that may or may not result in visa issuance.
And for that reason, I will assess everything else, essentially, ensuring the person, the applicant and their family are admissible to Canada and that they meet the eligibility requirements before asking them whether they can show proof of sufficient settlement funds. And that challenge will take place usually within two months of planned visa issuance."
