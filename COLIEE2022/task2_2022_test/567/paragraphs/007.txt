On October 9, 2003, the Applicant received a letter from the Canadian Embassy stating that the decision to refuse his application had been made on August 5, 2003 and the refusal letter was mailed on September 1, 2003. That refusal letter sets out the basis for denying his application in the following terms:
"You have obtained insufficient points to qualify for immigration to Canada, the minimum requirement being 75 points. You have not obtained sufficient points to satisfy me that you will be able to become economically established in Canada.
"Section 76(3) of the regulations permit an officer to substitute their evaluation of the likelihood to become economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded are not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada.
"As a result of your request for consideration under subsection 76(3) of the regulations, I have considered whether the number of points awarded is a sufficient indicator of whether you may become economically established in Canada. I have determined that the points that you have been awarded are a sufficient indicator of whether you may become economically established in Canada. The information and the explanations you have given me have not satisfied me that you will be able to become economically established in Canada despite obtaining insufficient points. As a result, I am not substituting my evaluation pursuant to subsection 76(3)."
