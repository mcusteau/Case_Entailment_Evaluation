The Respondent also notes that in the affidavit of the Visa Officer, filed in this proceeding, he specifically stated that he did not take the question of settlement funds into account and further said that he usually assessed the issue of funds at the end of the process.
"A review of the refusal letter and CAIPS notes confirms that I did not consider the issue of settlement funds prior to refusing the Applicant's application. As for the RPRF (formerly the Right of Landing Fee), payment of this is also postponed until we have completed the eligibility and admissibility assessments. Along with settlement funds, it is one of the last things requested by a visa officer."
