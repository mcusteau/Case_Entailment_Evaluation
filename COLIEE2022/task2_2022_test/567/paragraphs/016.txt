Section 8.2 of the OP6 Manual is also relevant as it provides that the requirement to provide "all information and documents" as stipulated by section 10(1)(c), must be carried out before an officer will undertake any substantive consideration of an application. In the event that an application does not meet this requirement, the officer is to advise the applicant that no further processing shall be completed until all supporting documents have been submitted.
