[2]
The designation of the Applicant in the style of cause to these reasons and in these reasons is not, of course, the designation in the style of cause on the application for leave and for judicial review. The Applicant relies on very sensitive personal information in seeking protection against his or her return to his or her country of origin. To protect against disclosure of such sensitive personal information, at the close of hearing of this application for judicial review, the Court and counsel agreed to the re-designation of the Applicant as "A.B.". Throughout these reasons, where it is more convenient to use personal pronouns than to repeat the designation "A.B.", masculine personal pronouns will be used. The use of such pronouns should not be interpreted to indicate that the Applicant is male as opposed to female.
