A draft of these reasons was distributed to counsel only and an opportunity was provided to counsel to comment on the formatting of the reasons for the protection of sensitive personal information and on whether a question for certification arises. Neither counsel expressed any concern about the formatting of the reasons and neither counsel recommended certification of a question. The Court itself is satisfied that no serious question of general importance here arises that would justify certification of a question. Accordingly, these reasons, somewhat modified from those distributed to counsel, will now issue. At the same time, an order will issue allowing this application for judicial review. The Order will direct the registry, for privacy reasons, to seal the Court's file herein and to maintain it sealed unless and until a judge of this Court orders otherwise.
