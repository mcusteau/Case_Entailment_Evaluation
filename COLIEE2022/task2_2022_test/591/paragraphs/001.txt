Gibson, J.
: These reasons follow the hearing of an application for judicial review of a decision, dated the 12th of June, 2007 made by a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment Officer (the "Officer"), wherein the Officer determined that the Applicant ("A.B.") "...has not demonstrated more than a mere possibility that [A.B.] will be at risk of persecution, and that [A.B.] has not demonstrated on the [sic] balance of probabilities, that [A.B.] would be in danger of torture, or at risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or at risk to life, if [A.B.] is returned to [A.B.'s country of citizenship]."
