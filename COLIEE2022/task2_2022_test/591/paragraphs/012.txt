[12]
A few paragraphs from the majority judgment delivered by Justices Bastarache and Lebel are of interest here. At paragraph [51], the Justices wrote:
Having dealt with the nature of the standards of review we now turn our attention to the method for selecting the appropriate standard in the individual cases. As we will now demonstrate, questions of fact, discretion and policy as well as questions where the legal issues cannot be easily separated from the factual issues generally attract a standard of reasonableness while many legal issues attract a standard of correctness. Some legal issues, however, attract the more deferential standard of reasonableness.
I read the foregoing paragraph as justifying the continuation of the past practice of this Court in identifying the standard of review of a pre-removal risk assessment decision, when viewed generally, as "reasonableness".
