The Court did not address paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the
Federal Courts Act.
[see footnote 5] The relevant portions of subsection 18.1(4) reads as follows:
18.1
(4) The Federal Court may grant relief under subsection (3) if it is satisfied that the federal board, commission or other tribunal
...
(d) based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it;
...
18.1
(4) Les mesures prévues au paragraphe (3) sont prises si la Cour fédérale est convaincue que l'office fédéral, selon le cas:
...
d) a rendu une décision ou une ordonnance fondée sur une conclusion de fait erronée, tirée de façon abusive ou arbitraire ou sans tenir compte des éléments dont il dispose;
...
I am satisfied that it remains clear that, where this Court is called upon to review a finding of a federal board, commission or other tribunal, the decision of which is under judicial review by this Court, this Court is still entitled, and indeed obliged, to grant relief if it determines that the finding is indeed a finding of fact and that it was made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the federal board, commission or other tribunal. This "standard of review" has been interpreted as akin to the now abolished standard of "patent unreasonableness". [see footnote 6]
