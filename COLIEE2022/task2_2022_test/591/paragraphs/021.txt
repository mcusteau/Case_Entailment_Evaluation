Finally, the Officer had good reason to be concerned about the honesty of A.B. in dealing with him or her. Those concerns could well have extended to a concern that A.B. might have manipulated his therapist, his spiritual advisor, his friend of longstanding and his partner or former partner in the provision of supportive letters. But for the Officer to so summarily dismiss those letters after A.B. was essentially invited to provide them, with an assurance that the Officer might well wish to verify information provided in the letters or to otherwise question the letter-writers, constitutes, I am satisfied a reviewable error. The Officer's decision is of great significance to A.B. It is essentially the last step prior to removal of A.B. from Canada after many, many years in this country and with the removal being to a nation with which A.B. apparently has had very little, if any, connection since his childhood. Violence is apparently endemic in that nation. Persons who are or are alleged to have a particular characteristic of A.B. are apparently at particular risk in that country.
