On Friday, the 7th of March, the world changed. In
Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick,
[see footnote 2] the Supreme Court merged the "patent unreasonableness" and reasonableness
simpliciter
standards of review and reduced the standards from three (3) to two (2), those being "correctness" and "reasonableness". The Court further re-identified the concept "pragmatic and functional analysis" with the same process now to be referred to as "standard of review analysis". [see footnote 3]
