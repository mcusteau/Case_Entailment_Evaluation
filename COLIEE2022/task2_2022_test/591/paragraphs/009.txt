The Officer adopted neither of the foregoing alternatives. Instead, he summarily dismissed A.B.'s referees' evidence in the following terms: first, with respect to a letter from A.B.'s therapist:
According to a letter from [the therapist] dated ..., [the therapist] stated that he did not present the applicant's [sensitive personal information] to the IAD, nor did he encourage [A.B.] to present this evidence to the I.A.D. He stated that he "as [A.B.'s] therapist had no information that this would be a relevant area that would impact on [his] possible deportation to [A.B.'s] [country of origin]." However, in the same letter [the therapist] later states "the likely prospect of being discovered as a [person of [sensitive personal information] ] would present serious threats to [A.B.'s] personal safety." When this inconsistency was raised with the applicant, [he] stated that [the therapist] must have become aware of the risks faced by [[sensitive personal information] individuals in [A.B.'s country of origin] ] during his research
after
the IAD's hearing. However, [the therapist] states that his practice is "targeted at [persons of the same heritage and ancestry" as A.B.] and as such, would have been familiar with the treatment of [[sensitive personal information] individuals in A.B.'s country of origin.] ] I find that [A.B.] has not provided me with a reasonable explanation why [his] evidence, in the form of [the therapist's] letter, contains such a significant inconsistency. As a result, I assign [the therapist's] letter dated ... little weight.;

secondly, with respect to a letter from A.B.'s spiritual community leader, the Officer wrote:
The applicant has provided a letter from [A.B.'s spiritual community leader ...]. According to the letter, [A.B.] disclosed to him that [he] is a [person of [sensitive personal information] ]. The writer of the letter has not provided me with sufficient evidence to show when this disclosure was made to him. In addition, I find that it is written by a person who may have an interest in the outcome of this application. Specifically, the writer states that [A.B.] is a dedicated and practising member of his church. I find that the writer does not show that it is not in his interest for [A.B.] to continue attending his church. I find that his statements regarding risks that [A.B.] may face in [A.B.'s country of origin] are speculative. The writer of the letter has not shown me that he is an expert on country conditions in [A.B.'s country of origin]. I also find that the writer is simply repeating what [A.B.] told him. For these reasons, I assign this letter little weight.;
thirdly, the Officer wrote with respect to a letter provided by a long-term friend of A.B.:
[A.B.] has provided a letter from [a friend]. [The friend] states that he has been [A.B.'s] friend for the last 20 years. He states that he has always known [him] as a [sensitive personal information]. However, I note [A.B.] did not state his name when asked who is aware of [his] [sensitive personal information]. Considering that they have been friends for two decades and have had "long discussion (sic) on the subject" of [A.B.'s] [sensitive personal information], it is unreasonable that [the friend] was not mentioned by [A.B.]. I find that [the friend] may also have an interest in the outcome of this application; he is [A.B.'s] friend. I also find that [the friend] has not shown me that his opinion of [A.B.'s] [sensitive personal information] is based on more than just what [A.B.] told him. For these reasons, I assign this evidence little weight.;
and finally, with respect to a letter provided from a partner, or perhaps now former partner of A.B., the Officer wrote:
[A.B.] provided a letter from [the partner]. [The partner] states that [he/she] has been in a ...relationship with [A.B.] since ... . Considering that this evidence states that [A.B.] and [the partner] have been "soul mates" for the last few years, it is unreasonable that there is no mention of [the partner] during [A.B.'s] IAD hearing, [A.B.'s] PRRA application or [his] original submissions. [A.B.] did not present any evidence regarding [the partner]
until the day of
[his] PRRA hearing. I note that [the partner] did not attend [A.B.'s] PRRA hearing. I note that the letter does not show that [the partner] does not have an interest in the outcome of this application. For these reasons, I assign this letter little weight.
