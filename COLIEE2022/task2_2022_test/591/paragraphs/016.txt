As earlier noted, the Officer, in convoking the hearing or interview with A.B., assured A.B. that, at the Officer's discretion, he or she might choose to verify information provided by third parties or to question third parties. A.B. was not requested to ensure that the persons on whose reference letters he relied would be available at the convoked hearing or interview. Thus, it was not surprising that A.B. did not bring those who provided letters on his behalf to the hearing or interview.
