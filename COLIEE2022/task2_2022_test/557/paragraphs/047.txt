[47]
If this Court had any lingering doubts about the lack of impartiality of this tribunal, they were dissipated upon reading this brief passage. The tribunal once again speculates without evidence by stating that the applicant intended to live and work illegally in the United States. Moreover, the tribunal's statement that the applicant "doubtless heard" about the movement of Czech Roma to Canada is difficult to accept given that the applicant is Bulgarian, not Czech, and that there was absolutely no evidence before the tribunal which would allow such an inference. In the absence of evidence, to characterize the applicant as opportunistic and untrustworthy was patently unreasonable. Seven weeks was a not unreasonable time within which to get the applicant's bearings in a strange country, on first impression, where he did not know the language. Some claimants might have taken less time, but this applicant is not "some claimants"; he is an individual whom the tribunal did not sufficiently particularize.
