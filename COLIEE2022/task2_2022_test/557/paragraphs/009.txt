In
Bains v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 63 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.), at 314, Mr. Justice Cullen quashed a decision of the tribunal after concluding that it erred because its plausibility findings were made without referring to the documentary evidence, and because they were made based on Canadian paradigms:
"[4] ...
However, in making a finding of what was plausible or implausible the Refugee Division made no reference to the documentary evidence filed in support of the applicant, namely the Amnesty International reports.
According to the reports, the events described by the applicant were not an unusual occurrence and constant harassment of members or former members of Akali Dal was the norm, not the exception. Therefore, in my view, the failure to comment on the evidence filed, either in a negative or positive manner, seriously weakened the Refugee Division's decision and conclusions. Further, the applicant's contention is wholly consistent with the documentary evidence filed and is probably the only source of evidence sustaining the applicant's case; or is the only clue to determining if the applicant's evidence is plausible. This documentary evidence was the only gauge available regarding the conduct of authorities in Indian vis-Ã -vis Sikhs and the reports referred to these occurrences as "routine".
"[5]
Moreover, the events as described by the applicant may have seemed implausible and therefore not credible to the Refugee Division, but as counsel for the applicant points out 'Canadian paradigms do not apply in India'.
Torture, unhappily, is real, as is exploitation and revenge, often resulting in killings." (emphasis added)
