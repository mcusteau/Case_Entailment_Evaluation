The tribunal incorrectly remarked that the applicant had blue eyes, and does not appear to accept his assertion that many Bulgarian Roma have green eyes. Further, the tribunal admits to having no experience regarding the Bulgarian Roma, yet is quick to dismiss his claim in part because of his appearance. In
Pluhar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 174 F.T.R. 153 (T.D.), at 155, Mr. Justice Evans stated the following regarding appearance:
"[10]
In my opinion the Refugee Division erred in law by effectively basing the decision on its assessment that Ms. Pluharova was not dark skinned, especially since it claimed no relevant 'expertise'.
It is inherently dangerous for Board members to base a finding on whether people in another country would regard a claimant as of particular ethnicity solely on the basis of the members' observation of the person concerned.
"[11] There may, of course, be some situations in which it will be quite obvious from a person's appearance that the person is not of a particular ethnicity. However, since Ms. Pluharova had black hair and a 'sun tanned' appearance, the panel's 'common sense' was an insufficiently reliable basis for the panel's assessment of such a sensitive matter. Skin tone cannot be categorized simply as either 'light' or 'dark': there is a broad spectrum between these polarities. Racists may be able to identify a person as a member of a minority group by physical characteristics that would not necessarily be apparent to people in other countries." (emphasis added)
