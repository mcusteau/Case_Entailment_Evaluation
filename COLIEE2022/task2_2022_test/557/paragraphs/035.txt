The second document which is reviewed by the tribunal at page 9 is a letter dated January 30, 1997, from the mayor of Kurdzhaly which certified that the applicant was a "Bulgarian citizen of the Roma (Gypsy) ethnic group." The tribunal analyzed this letter and accorded it low probative value because the applicant was not personally known to the mayor.
