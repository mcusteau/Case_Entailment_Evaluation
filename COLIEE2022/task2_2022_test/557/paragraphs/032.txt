Once again, the tribunal mis-characterizes the evidence. As recorded at page 15 of the transcript of the proceedings, the applicant did not state that he did not know of the whereabouts of the baptismal certificate, but rather that his parents had lost the original and that he had needed a new one. The tribunal continued at page 8:
"The claimant was also asked whether he had ever possessed a birth certificate issued by district authorities and he replied that he did not have such a document and added that such registrations were 'purely discretionary' on the part of parents. Later on in his evidence he seemed to indicate that district registrations were mandatory for all, but somehow this process had not been followed in his own case.
The panel has no precise information surrounding birth registration requirements in Bulgaria during the period in which the claimant was born, but notes from its experience with other claims that it would be a decided departure from normal communist government practice to permit secular birth registrations to be made on a 'discretionary' basis.
This was particularly the case during the period in question as church attendance and church record-keeping at that time were both proscribed, according to the claimant." (emphasis added)
