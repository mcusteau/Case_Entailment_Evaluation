[11]
Despite this account, the tribunal concluded that the applicant's testimony was not credible in its entirety because the tribunal perceived his story to be implausible. For example, regarding the applicant's testimony that he was being pressured to sign a form which would terminate his apartment lease, the tribunal asks the following rhetorical question at page 11:
"...
Why would a regime that was so arbitrary and lawless in its basic character so as to repeatedly beat and abduct the claimant, be fastidious about having him sign an apartment release
, or ask him to fill and complete his own summonses and subpoenas? This makes no sense at all ..." (emphasis added)
Was that tribunal falsely applying Canadian paradigms?
