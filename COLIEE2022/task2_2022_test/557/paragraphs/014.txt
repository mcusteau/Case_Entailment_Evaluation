After rejecting the applicant's testimony, the tribunal offers its own version of events at page 12:
"
The panel believes that the most reasonable explanation is that the seeds of the claimant's conflict probably had their origin in a deteriorating mental condition on the part of the claimant's mother that, in turn, caused her to become a danger to herself and to her neighbours.
This would explain the 'fire' episode that apparently led to her hospitalization.
In the panel's view, it beggars belief that a neighbour would have deliberately started a blaze in order to wrongly [sic] blame the claimant's mother. Why would anyone risk their [sic]own life [sic] or their neighbours' lives in such a mad endeavour?
Why would they need to, if prejudice against a Roma family, in the complex was so strong that eviction could move forward on that basis alone?
Further, it seems probable to the panel that intemperate (possibly defamatory) accusations by the claimant concerning his mother's hospitalization and death, expressed in strongly-worded letters to Ministers, set the stage for further conflicts with neighbours and civic officials.
