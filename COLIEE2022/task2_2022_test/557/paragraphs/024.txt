In assessing the credibility of the evidence, a tribunal can evaluate the general demeanour of the applicant as he or she is testifying. This involves assessing the manner in which the witness replies to questions, his or her facial expressions, tone of voice, physical movements, general integrity and intelligence, and powers of recollection. However, problems may arise in interpreting the demeanour of refugee claimants from different cultural backgrounds. Moreover, persons who have suffered persecution may experience problems in relating their testimony.
