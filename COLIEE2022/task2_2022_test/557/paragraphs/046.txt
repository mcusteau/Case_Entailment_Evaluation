On page 16, the tribunal once again attempts to explain the actions of the applicant without evidence:
"The panel believes that the claimant went to the United States
intending to live and work there illegally
for reasons not attached to fear but of economic advancement. Once in the United States,
he doubtless heard about the movement of Czech Roma to Canada
- a phenomenon that attracted world-wide publicity -
and decided to test the waters with a claim built upon the same foundation.
When his delay in claiming is coupled to the other elements in his story that are also strongly wanting in credibility, a picture emerges of an
opportunistic and untrustworthy witness
." (emphasis added)
