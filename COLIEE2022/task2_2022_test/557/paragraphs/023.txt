The tribunal evaluated the applicant's demeanour while testifying at page 10 of the decision:
"The panel found the witness to be
verbose
and often
overly assertive
in manner. He tended to
shout to emphasize
points; often
rambled,
had to be frequently cautioned about
'out-running' the interpreter
, and much of his oral testimony consisted of
wooden
,
declamatory
rhetoric displaying a
rehearsed
and
unspontaneous
character. At times his answers were
prolix
in the extreme,
off-centre,
and
evasive.
In fairness to the claimant, the panel also sensed that he did seem to have a festering sense of anger that may have had its origins in some form of injustice or what the claimant perceived to be injustice. Given the claimant's
voluble
and
bombastic
testimony, the panel found it necessary to discriminate closely between the claimant's perceptions of reality and objective reality when evaluating and weighing his evidence." (emphasis added)
That it is solely for the tribunal to assess the claimant's testimony is a principle which is sometimes stated with almost religious zeal
