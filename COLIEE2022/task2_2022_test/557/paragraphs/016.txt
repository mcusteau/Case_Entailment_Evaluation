The tribunal questions the plausibility of the applicant's evidence once again at page 14 when it asks him to explain the actions of the authorities who interrogated his children, and once again rejects his answer:
"
He was then asked what he felt the authorities sought to achieve by interrogating his daughter and he said that the prosecutor insisted she 'sign a paper.'
Did the claimant know what was in the paper? He testified that he did not, neither did his daughter, and that, in any event, they had not really discussed it. After stating that his family were co-defendants and victims of persecution along with the claimant and that all the persecution had 'shifted to the shoulders of my son,' the claimant was asked whether any effort had been made to evict them since his departure."
