The test for a reasonable apprehension of bias is whether an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through would conclude that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the tribunal members (see
Committee for Justice and Liberty Foundation et al. v. National Energy Board et al.
, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369; 9 N.R. 115; 68 D.L.R.(3d) 716). It is not difficult to conclude that the test has been met here. The following factors were significant in coming to this conclusion:
a. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding the pressure faced by the applicant to sign a release form;
b. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding the searches of the applicant's home;
c. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding how the fire started near the applicant's home;
d. The tribunal's findings of implausibility regarding the interrogation of his children;
e. The tribunal's speculation, without evidence, regarding the events surrounding his mother's commitment to a mental hospital;
f. The tribunal's speculation, without evidence, regarding the events which led the applicant to travel to Canada from the United States;
g. The mis-characterization by the tribunal in relating the manner in which the applicant answered questions regarding his minor daughter's interrogation;
h. The mis-characterization by the tribunal in relating the manner in which the applicant answered questions regarding his baptismal certificate;
i. The contradictory statements regarding the applicant's demeanour while testifying;
j. The assignment of blame against the applicant as being the cause of his conflict with the authorities;
k. The material error of fact regarding the apartment card; and
l. The omission from the analysis, without explanation, of documents which appear to support the applicant's claim, at least one of which was specifically requested by the tribunal.
