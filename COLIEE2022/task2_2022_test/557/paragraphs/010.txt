The applicant alleged that the Bulgarian police and civic officials were trying to evict him and his family from their apartment in Sofia because they were Roma. He testified that he was unwilling to leave his apartment because he and his family had previously been evicted and had waited four years to secure new accommodations. The applicant testified that in the attempt to evict him, his mother was improperly incarcerated in a mental asylum where she died, and that he was abducted, savagely beaten, jailed without legal authority, and pulled back from a work assignment abroad in Russia. Further, he stated that his apartment was rigorously searched, and that his family were repeatedly interrogated while his lawyer's efforts to secure justice were brushed aside. Throughout this campaign, there was a continuing effort to compel the applicant to sign a statement voluntarily relinquishing his lodgings, while a parallel effort was underway to seize copies of all of the applicant's complaints to various government officials.
