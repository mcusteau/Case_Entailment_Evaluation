[45]
In reviewing the transcript of the proceedings, this Court finds that there was nothing fuzzy or unclear in the applicant's response on page 23: he stated that he is convinced that Canada accepts refugees more easily. Moreover, there is nothing implausible about the applicant's obtaining a job in the United States to pay for his visa to come to Canada. Finally, to characterize a seven-week delay as painting a picture "of an opportunistic and untrustworthy witness" again implies dishonesty on the part of the applicant, and amounts in the circumstances, to speculation made of whole cloth by the tribunal.
