Throughout this decision, the tribunal asks the applicant to explain the actions of the authorities, and then categorically rejects his answers. The applicant testified that the officials sought to evict him because his family was Roma, and, as shall be seen, there was evidence to support this claim. What more could he say? The tribunal itself reviewed the entrenched discrimination and persecution against the Roma in Bulgaria starting at page 16 of the decision, yet rejected the applicant's explanation that he was being pressured to sign a document which would force him from his apartment because he was Roma. One cannot understand how the tribunal expects the applicant to explain logically the illogical actions of the authorities. It was not implausible that the authorities needed his signature to terminate the lease, but, without evidence to support its findings, the tribunal was in no position to contradict the applicant's testimony.
