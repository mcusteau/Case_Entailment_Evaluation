[48]
The applicant urged this Court to hold that the tribunal demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of bias when it described his demeanour while testifying. Although one cannot agree with the assertion that a negative description of an applicant's demeanour, per se, constitutes a reasonable apprehension of bias, this Court infers that in this instance it is merely one aspect of a pattern which raises the Court's reasonable apprehension of the tribunal's probable bias against this applicant.
