[35]
The Applicant relied on Mr. Justice James Russell's decision in
Mui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2003 FC 1020, 31 Imm. L.R. (3d) 91. The Board reached a negative conclusion about the applicant's credibility because her mother and her husband's mother, who were friends and played an important part in her marriage, had not been called as witnesses. However, the Court concluded at paragraph 35 of the decision that adverse credibility findings cannot be based on a lack of evidence.
