THIS COURT ORDERS THAT:
This application for judicial review is allowed, the PRRA decision dated October 15, 2004 is set aside, and the PRRA application is to be redetermined by another PRRA Officer as soon as possible after providing the applicant with a hearing (i.e. an interview) so that the PRRA Officer can assess the credibility of the applicant's allegations.
