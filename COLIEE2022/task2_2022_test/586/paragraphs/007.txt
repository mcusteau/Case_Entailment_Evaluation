The applicant filed an application for judicial review of the PRRA decision on October 22, 2004. On November 9, 2004, Mr. Justice Mackay issued a stay of deportation pending resolution of this judicial review, and he held at paragraphs 12, 13 and 14 of his decision:
12. In my opinion circumstances of this case give rise to concern about procedural fairness in considering the PRRA application of the applicant. Here a specific request was made for an oral hearing with reference to subsection 113(b) of IRPA and section 167 of the IRPA Regulations. The latter sets out factors to be considered when determining whether or not a hearing is required.
Those factors relate to whether there is a serious issue of the applicant's credibility in regard to evidence central to the decision with respect to the application for protection
. The decision of the PRRA officer makes no reference to those factors, or to any other factors that led to the decision not to have an oral hearing despite the written request for one. There is no evidence in the decision that consideration was given to the appropriateness of an oral hearing apart from indicating that none was held. Moreover, the timing of the decision, which stresses the lack of objective and supportive evidence, despite an indication that such evidence was being sought, a decision made within seven days of the receipt of the application, effectively precluded the attempt to provide information or evidence with respect to the applicant's circumstances after his deportation to Iran. This precluded consideration of any new evidence apart from the representations made by him and in writing by his agents. (Emphasis added)
13. I do not suggest that if an oral hearing is requested that request must be granted. Yet here one was requested and the circumstances supporting that request were advanced but no reference was made in the PRRA decision to consideration of the request, to the circumstances advanced, or the factors set out in the regulations to be weighed in considering the request. Moreover, the essence of the decision is that the applicant's story and professed fears are given no weight, effectively rejecting the applicant's evidence as not credible even though no specific reference is made to credibility as an issue. That process of decision making was ultimately unfair, particularly, where the timing of the process effectively foreclosed a reasonable time for presentation of supporting evidence.
14. That unfairness in my view warrants intervention of the Court to stay the removal of the applicant pending the determination for leave and for judicial review of the PRRA decision, without prejudice to consideration of the leave application by a judge, when the application is perfected.
Mr. Justice MacKay has thoroughly examined the underlying issue, and concluded that the PRRA process was unfair to the applicant.
