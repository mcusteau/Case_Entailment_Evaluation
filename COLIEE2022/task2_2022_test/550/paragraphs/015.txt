The test under rule 419(1)(a) for determining whether a pleading discloses a reasonable cause of action is whether the facts, if taken as proved, disclose a cause of action having "some chance of success" (
Hirsch Co. v. Minshall et al.
(1988), 89 N.R. 136; 22 C.P.R.(3d) 268 (F.C.A.)). The power of the court to strike out a pleading, or portions thereof, as disclosing no cause of action should be exercised only in plain and obvious cases (
Burnaby Machine & Mill Equipment Ltd. v. Berglund Industrial Supply Co. Ltd. et al.
(1982), 64 C.P.R.(2d) 206 (F.C.T.D.)).
