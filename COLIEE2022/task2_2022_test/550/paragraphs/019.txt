I am of the view that paragraphs 6, 7, 8 and 23 of the Amended Statement of Defence should be struck because these paragraphs do not allege facts which, if proven, could possibly constitute a valid challenge to the presumption of ownership. No factual foundation is found in these paragraphs (
Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Babcock Allatt Ltd.
, [1983] 67 C.P.R.(2d) 135 (F.C.T.D.); affd. (1983), 72 C.P.R.(2d) 286 (F.C.A.)). This is done without prejudice to the right of the defendants to seek leave to further amend their Amended Statement of Defence.
