NoÃ«l, J., stated the following in
Samsonite Canada Inc. v. Costco Wholesale Corp.
(1993), 62 F.T.R. 278; 48 C.P.R. 5 (T.D.):
"Part of the claim which the defendant purports to meet by its thrice further amended statement of defence is based on a challenge of the plaintiff's asserted ownership of the copyrights in issue. The plaintiff's position in this regard stands by the presumption of ownership which arises from the certificate of registration issued in its name. It is open to the defendant to challenge this presumption by its pleadings provided that it is in a position to allege facts which, if proven, can have the effect to rebutting the presumption of ownership.
. . . . .
"In order for the defendant to go behind the certificate of registration, it must be in a position to allege facts which, if proven, could possibly rebut the presumption of ownership.
. . . . .
"In reaching his decision, Peter Giles, A.S.P., was obviously of the view that the defendant was aware of no fact which would allow it to rebut the presumption of ownership of the copyrights in issue which in this instance operates in favour of the plaintiff by virtue of the certificate of registration issued in its name. This presumption has been held to be sufficient to establish ownership of a copyright in the absence of evidence showing that title lies with someone else: see
