On August 13, 2012, Mr. Zheng learned from his spouse, via a telephone conversation, that Mr. Gao had been arrested by the Chinese Public Security Bureau [PSB] because of his unlawful activities as a Falun Gong practitioner. Mr. Zheng’s spouse apparently told him not to return home, not to go to work and to immediately enter into hiding. As a result of the conversation with his spouse, Mr. Zheng boarded a bus to the countryside and hid at his uncle’s home. Fearing that his presence would eventually implicate his uncle, Mr. Zheng decided to leave China. Through his uncle, Mr. Zheng was introduced to a smuggler who assisted him in obtaining a visa to leave China. On November 12, 2012, Mr. Zheng left China. He arrived in Canada on November 13 and on November 20, 2012, made a claim for refugee protection.
