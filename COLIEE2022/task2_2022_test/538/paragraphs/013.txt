It is well-established that the standard of review applicable on matters of credibility and fact finding is that of reasonableness (Cambara v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1019 at para 13; Scott v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1066 [Scott] at para 26; Aguebor v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration) (1993), 160 NR 315, [1993] FCJ No 732 (FCA) at para 4). When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with “the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law” (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir] at para 47; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 [Khosa] at para 59).
