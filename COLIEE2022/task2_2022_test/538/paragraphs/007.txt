The RPD began its analysis by outlining the issues it considered to be determinative, namely: credibility, specifically whether the Applicant is a genuine Falun Gong practitioner, whether he is wanted by the PSB, and in the alternative, whether he has an Internal Flight Alternative [IFA] within China. Given my conclusion that the RPD made reasonable findings in relation to both Mr. Zhengâ€™s practice of Falun Gong and his alleged pursuit by the PSB, I need not address the issue of the IFA.
