Mr. Zheng contends the RPD failed to assess his sincerity, focusing instead on its own unreliable objective criteria. I readily accept that it is the genuineness of beliefs that matter and not whether those beliefs are theologically sound (Gao v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1139 at para 26). That said, it is reasonable for a decision-maker to expect a rudimentary knowledge of one’s faith (Wang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 668 at paras 29-39). In this case, lack of knowledge of the location of the “law wheel”, failure to know karma is to be eliminated, not acquired, and failure to understand the concept of cultivation and the role exercises play in reaching different levels of cultivation were properly considered by the RPD. These factors were part of the credibility matrix considered by the RPD. It is not the Court’s role to reassess the evidence for purposes of substituting its own view for that of the RPD (Khosa, at paras 59, 61).
