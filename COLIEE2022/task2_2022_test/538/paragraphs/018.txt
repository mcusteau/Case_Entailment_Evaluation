The sincerity of Mr. Zheng’s beliefs cannot be divorced from his lack of basic knowledge of Falun Gong. The RPD, through its questioning of Mr. Zheng was not seeking an epistemological evaluation of his religious knowledge. It is reasonable to conclude that his answers to some basic questions would influence an assessment of his sincerity. If I were to accept the assertion that the RPD placed too much emphasis on Mr. Zheng’s personal knowledge rather than a careful assessment of his “sincerity”, I would fall into the trap of hunting for error and looking for a reason to substitute this Court’s view for that of the RPD.  Reviewing courts must not engage in a treasure hunt for error (Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd., 2013 SCC 34 at para 54). Furthermore, it would be erroneous to suggest that subjective sincerity cannot be evidenced by objective knowledge. If tribunals are prevented from using objective knowledge to assist in the determination of sincere beliefs, I rhetorically ask, how is a tribunal or court to assess the veracity of someone saying: “I am Falun Gong”, “I am Christian”, “I am Muslim”, “I am Jewish” or any one of hundreds of other faith groups across the planet.  While I am not suggesting that objective knowledge is determinative of the question of sincerely held beliefs, it is certainly an evidentiary factor to be considered by the RPD.  As such, it is a factor which this Court should avoid re-assessing.

Reasonableness of the conclusion that Mr. Zheng is not sought by the PSB
