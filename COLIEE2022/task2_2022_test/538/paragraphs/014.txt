Although the RPD concluded Mr. Zheng testified in a credible fashion, it also concluded he lacked credibility with respect to his practice of Falun Gong and his assertion that he is being pursued by the PSB. Mr. Zheng contends the RPD erred by finding him credible, yet lacking credibility in certain matters. With respect, I disagree. The RPD’s observations are not mutually exclusive. One may testify in a credible fashion, yet be disbelieved with respect to assertions essential to one’s claim. Similarly, one may be credible but simply lack proof of the essential elements to be established.
