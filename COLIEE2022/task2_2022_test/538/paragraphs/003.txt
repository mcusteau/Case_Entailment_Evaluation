In June 2010, Mr. Zheng suffered a back injury that, according to him, “changed his life”. Following the accident, a doctor recommended back surgery. After learning about the risks associated with the surgery, Mr. Zheng chose not to undergo the procedure. In October 2010, one of his friends [Mr. Gao] introduced him to the practice of Falun Gong. With the help of Mr. Gao, Mr. Zheng began practising Falun Gong exercises at his home. In December 2010, given the positive effects on his health, Mr. Zheng joined a practice group organized by Mr. Gao.
