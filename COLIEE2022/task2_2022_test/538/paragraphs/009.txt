After finding that Mr. Zheng is not a genuine practitioner of Falun Gong, the RPD undertook an analysis of whether he is sought by the PSB. On this issue, the RPD noted that the PSB did not leave any document, such as a summons, during their alleged visits to Mr. Zhengâ€™s home. In light of the documentary evidence available, the RPD was of the view that this was not in accordance with the normal procedure. The RPD considered the lack of a summons, the fact Mr. Zheng left China with a visa in his own name, the fact his spouse lives unmolested in Shandong Province and receives a government pension and the fact his son left China with no difficulties, in arriving at its conclusion he is not being pursued by the PSB. The RPD also referred to country condition information regarding the effectiveness of the computer network of policing known as the Golden Shield Project, in concluding Mr. Zheng is not sought by the PSB.
