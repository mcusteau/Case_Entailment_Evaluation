The RPD candidly acknowledged there were weaknesses in its observations about Mr. Zhengâ€™s ability to leave China with a visa in his own name and the efficacy of the Golden Shield Project given that Mr. Zheng was assisted by a smuggler and given that exit controls were not fully implemented at the time he left China. Regardless, given the totality of the evidence, the RPD reached the following conclusion:
The panel finds that there is no evidence that the claimant is wanted by the PSB. Given the documentary evidence demonstrating the aggressive actions of the Chinese government in pursuing Falun Gong practitioners and their families, the panel finds that the claimant has failed to meet the burden of proof to support his claim that he is wanted by the PSB.
