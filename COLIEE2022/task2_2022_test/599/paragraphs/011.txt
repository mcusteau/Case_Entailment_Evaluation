It seems to me that the permitted sub足ject-matter of an application for judicial review is contained in s. 18.1(3), which provides that on an application for judicial review the Trial Division may order a federal agency to do
any act
or
thing
that it has unlawfully failed or refused to do, or declare invalid or set aside and refer back, prohibit or restrain "a decision, order,
act
or
proceeding
of a federal board, commission or other tribunal". The words "act or pro足ceeding" are clearly broad in scope and may include a diverse range of administrative action that does not amount to a "decision or order", such as subordinate legislation, re足ports or recommendations made pursuant to statutory powers, policy statements, guide足lines and operating manuals, or any of the myriad forms that administrative action may take in the delivery by a statutory agency of a public programme: see
