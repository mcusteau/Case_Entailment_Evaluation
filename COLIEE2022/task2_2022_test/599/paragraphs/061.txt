No doubt statutory remedies of the kind contained in the
Income Tax Act
were not what the Legislature primarily had in mind when it defined "action" to include "any exercise of a self help remedy". However, when included as an alternative to "any proceeding in court", self help remedies should be regarded as including the statutory remedies available to assist Revenue Canada in recovering tax debts by unilateral means that do not include resort to litigation. Otherwise, there would be a gap in the law that cannot be justified in light of the policy of the
Limitation Act
.
