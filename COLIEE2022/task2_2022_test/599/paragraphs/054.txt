More recently, however, in
Gingras v. Canada
(1994), 165 N.R. 101; 113 D.L.R.(4th) 295 (F.C.A.), Décary, J.A., considered (at 319) whether the Crown's obligation to pay a language bonus to the plaintiff as a member of the R.C.M.P. arose under federal or provincial law. If the latter, then it would be subject to the limitation period prescribed in the
Civil Code of Lower Canada
. Décary, J.A., pointed out that it would be somewhat incongruous if the enforceability of the right created by a federal statute depended on the province in which the member happened to live. On the facts, however, it was not necessary for him to express a definitive view on whether the statute created a federal cause of action.
