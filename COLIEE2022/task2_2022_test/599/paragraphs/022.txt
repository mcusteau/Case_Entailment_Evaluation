[22]
There are two methods by which the Minister may seek to collect a debt that is owing as a result of an unpaid tax liability under s. 222 of the
Income Tax Act
. First, the Minister may institute legal proceedings by way of a statement of claim for the recovery of a debt in the Federal Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Second, the Minister may employ one of the statutory collection methods that do not require the institution of an action. These include registering a certificate of indebtedness with the Federal Court under s. 223 of the
Income Tax Act
and issuing to third party creditors a requirement to pay under s. 224 of the
Act
.
