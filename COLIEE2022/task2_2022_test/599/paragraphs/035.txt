[35]
The opening words of s. 32, "Except as otherwise provided in this Act or any other Act of Parliament", limit the scope of its application. The respondent's argument is that the
Income Tax Act
contains its own limitation periods that apply to various aspects of the assessment, reassessment, review of assessments and collection of tax. In other words, the statute is a complete code and is not subject to limitation periods prescribed in general legislation dealing with proceedings to which the Crown is a party, or to civil litigation as a whole.
