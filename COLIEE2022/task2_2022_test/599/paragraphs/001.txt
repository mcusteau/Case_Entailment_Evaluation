Evans, J.
: The
Income Tax Act
imposes no limitation on the time within which the Minister of National Revenue (hereinafter "the respondent" or "the Minister") may seek to collect unpaid tax for which a taxpayer has been duly assessed. In the absence of any express provisions in the
Income Tax Act
itself, the principal question raised in this case is whether the Minister's exercise of the statutory collection powers is subject to a limitation period, whether that contained in the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50, s. 32 or in the relevant provincial limitation statute. The applicant contends that it is, while the Minister says that it is not.
