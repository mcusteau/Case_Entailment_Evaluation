A difficulty with this argument is that, in distinguishing ss. 38(1) and (2) in
E.H. Price Ltd.
, Clement, D.J., emphasized the presence of the words "in the court" (or "in court" as he also sometimes incorrectly put it) in s. 38(1). This is what he seems to have regarded as preventing him from concluding that registering a certificate of indebtedness fell within that subsection, but permitted him to decide that it did fall within s. 38(2), where the operative words were "proceedings by and against the Crown", with no "in the court" limitation. In view of this, I am unable to conclude that
E.H. Price Ltd.
is as damaging to the applicant's case as the respondent contends.
