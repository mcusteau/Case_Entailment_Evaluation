Although they will be broken into several more specific components, the principal issues raised by this litigation are as follows.
1. Does s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
apply to the exercise by the Minister of National Revenue of the statutory power to issue requirements to pay with respect to a duly assessed tax liability under the
Income Tax Act
?
2. If it does, is the applicant's liability under the
Income Tax Act
one that "arises in a province", or "otherwise than in a province"?
3. If it arises in a province, is the issue of a requirement to pay a "proceeding in a court" or an "exercise of a self help remedy" within the definition of "action" in s. 1 of the British Columbia
Limitation Act
?
4. Regarding the requirement to pay issued with respect to unpaid taxes under the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
:
i) does the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
exclude the application of the British Columbia
Limitation Act
from governing the time within which the Minister must exercise the power to collect the tax?
ii) if it does not, does the British Columbia
Limitation Act
apply to the exercise of powers by a Minister of the federal Crown pursuant to the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
?
