However, since there were words in the statutes in these cases that related to the very measures invoked and alleged to be subject to the limitations statute, the decisions do not bear directly on the problem in the case at bar. However, counsel for the respondent also pointed out that when
E.H. Price Ltd.
, supra, and
Bri√®re
, supra, were decided, s. 38(2) of the
Federal Court Act
stated that it applied unless another act
expressly
provided otherwise. The word "expressly" no longer appears in s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
, thus making it easier for a court to infer from the overall scheme created by the statute that its limitations provisions are exhaustive.
