Section 29 of the
Interpretation Act
defines "government" to mean "Her Majesty in right of British Columbia". Therefore, "government" does not include a Minister of the federal Crown, even when acting on behalf of the Crown in right of the Province. Since the statutory presumption does not apply here, the common law presumption does. Therefore, in the absence of express words or necessary implication, the British Columbia
Limitation Act
does not apply to measures taken by a Minister of the federal Crown to enforce the British Columbia
Income Tax Act
. In my opinion the
Limitation Act
cannot be said as a matter of necessary implication to apply to the federal Crown.
