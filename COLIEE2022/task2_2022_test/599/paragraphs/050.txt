In the event that my conclusion on both parts of the above issue are wrong, then the final question relating to the interpretation of s. 32 of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
is whether the British Columbia
Limitation Act
applies. It will apply only if the failure to pay tax owing is a "cause of action arising in a province". If, on the other hand, the cause of action arises "otherwise than in a province", then the six years' limitation provision contained in s. 32 for proceedings by and against the federal Crown will apply.
