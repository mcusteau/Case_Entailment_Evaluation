In principle there is much to be said in favour of the proposition that the
Income Tax Act
should be applied uniformly to taxpayers across the country to the greatest extent possible. Of course, as Mr. Worland pointed out, there are situations in which taxpayers' liability on the same facts will inevitably vary depending on the province where they reside. Thus, whether or not a tax is payable, or an expenditure deductible, may depend on the legal consequences that the law of contract of the province where the taxpayer resides ascribes to a particular transaction.
