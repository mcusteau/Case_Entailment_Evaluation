First, it is a hypothetical consideration in the context of this case, and there may be reasons that have not been canvassed here for concluding that the Crown's right to pursue an action for debt is subject to a statutory limitation period, even though the statutory collection methods are not. Second, the respondent's statutory duty to assess "with all due dispatch" the tax owing provides protection against most of the mischiefs at which statutory prescription periods are aimed. Third, to regard the respondent's ability to collect tax as subject to the
Crown Liability and Proceedings Act
for this reason alone would give insufficient weight to the difficulties that importing general limitation periods would cause to the fair and effective collection of tax arrears.
