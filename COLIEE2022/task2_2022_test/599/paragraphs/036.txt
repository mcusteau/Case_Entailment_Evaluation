Two cases were brought to my attention where this issue was explicitly raised. In
E.H. Price Ltd.
, supra, it was held that the limitation statutes did not prescribe the time within which a certificate of indebtedness must be registered with the court under the
Excise Act
. The court drew this inference from provisions in the
Excise Act
to the effect that sums payable under it were recoverable "at any time".
