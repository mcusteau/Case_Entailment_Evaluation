Nonetheless, the special nature of tax legislation, and in particular the reliance placed upon its provisions by those planning their affairs in order to minimize or avoid tax liability, has meant that the broad and purposive approach applied to legislation in general is not applied to the same extent to the interpretation of tax statutes. The "plain meaning" rule retains a vigour in this area that it does not have elswhere: see, for example,
Antosko v. Minister of National Revenue
, [1994] 2 S.C.R 312; 168 N.R. 16, at 326-327 [S.C.R.]. And in
2747-3174 Québec Inc. v. Régie des permis d'alcool du Québec et autres
, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 919; 205 N.R. 1, 1013-1014, L'Heureux-Dubé, J., said that, for these reasons, and because business practice has often contextualized the meaning of words used in tax statutes, the "plain meaning" rule should be given priority over the purposive or "modern" approach with which courts generally approach the interpretation of legislation.
