With all respect, I do not share this rather limited view of the scope of the subÂ­ject-matter of this court's judicial review jurisdiction. The words "decision or order" are found in s. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, which provides that an application for judicial review of a "decision or order" must be made within 30 days after the time that the decision or order was first communicated by the decision-maker. In my opinion, this subsection simply provides a limitation period within which an application for judicial review of a decision or order must normally be made. It does not say that only decisions or orders may be the subject of an application for judicial review, nor does it say that administrative action other than decisions or orders are subject to the 30 days' limitation period:
