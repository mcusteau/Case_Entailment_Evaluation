I turn now to the issues argued in relation to the plaintiff's application for an interlocutory injunction. In so doing I note for the record that as recited in the order of Mr. Justice Muldoon on March 19, counsel on behalf of both the plaintiff and the defendants invoked "the provisions of the
Indian Act
(R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, as amended) and this court's jurisdiction in regard thereto". Nothing I heard in Calgary has given me a different sense of this basic position of both parties.
