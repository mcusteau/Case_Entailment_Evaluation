In support of his application for an interlocutory injunction the plaintiff urges that the requirements for award of such relief are met. There is a serious issue to be tried, the plaintiff and the Tribe will suffer irreparable harm if the relief now sought pending trial is not granted, and the balance of convenience favours the award of an injunction at this stage, weighing the possible harm to the plaintiff against possible harm to the defendants if the relief is granted and ultimately found not to be warranted.
