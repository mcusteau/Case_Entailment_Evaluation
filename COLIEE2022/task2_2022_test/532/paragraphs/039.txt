Here the plaintiff seeks an interlocutory injunction, presumably pending trial of the action. When asked, counsel for the parties could not realistically anticipate trial of the action before the next anticipated general election of the Tribe for the offices of the Chief and Councillors, now some 18 months away. Unless they were able to agree upon facts which would permit trial of the action without the usual pretrial preparations, counsels' expectations seem realistic. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to consider an injunction pending trial of the action, which would restrain the parties from seeking to depose one another from office, and to maintain the legal status of each as duly elected officers of the Tribe, maintaining the status quo until an uncertain date in future. Nor, in my view, is it realistic to consider an injunctive order extending until the next anticipated general election.
