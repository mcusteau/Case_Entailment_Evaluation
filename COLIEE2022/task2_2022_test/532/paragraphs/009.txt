This summarizes the developments up to the time of the hearing fixed by the order of March 29 for hearing the plaintiff's application for an interlocutory injunction, except for one other matter. Following the order of March 29 it appears the defendants received a petition, said to be signed by some 1,200 members of the Tribe urging that the plaintiff be removed from office. The validity of the petition is apparently questioned by the plaintiff, both in the manner in which it was perceived as promoted by the defendants, and in relation to some, at least, of the signatories. The petition was referred to in passing, by counsel for the defendants, during the hearing of this matter which extended through morning sittings from June 21 to 23, but it was not a matter of discussion, submissions or argument at the hearing. Following the hearing, I am advised that on June 22, the defendants sitting as the council, received the petition and directed a hearing of the matters it raised to be held on June 28, and the plaintiff was served notice of that hearing. Counsel for the plaintiff, in submissions about terms of the order I might issue to extend an interim injunction, urged that council be enjoined from conducting the proposed hearing, but since this had not been argued before me I declined to provide specifically for this matter in the order issued.
