MacKay, J.
: Before the court in this proceeding is an application by the plaintiff dated March 26, 1993, for an interlocutory injunction and other orders. The motion was originally heard, as a matter of urgency, by telephone conference by my colleague Mr. Justice Teitelbaum on March 26. As a result of that hearing he issued an order dated March 29, 1993, which enjoined the parties from certain activities until June 21, 1993 or such later date as may be directed by the court. On June 21 after hearing on this application commenced but before it was concluded, with consent of counsel for the parties, an order was issued extending the application of the order of March 29 until further order. Following conclusion of the hearing an order issued on June 25 extending the application of previous interim orders, modified to meet circumstances at that date, until November 2, 1993 when the plaintiff may again apply for extension or further interim or interlocutory injunctive relief.
