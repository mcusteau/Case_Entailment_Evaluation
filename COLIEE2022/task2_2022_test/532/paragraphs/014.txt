The defendants acknowledge decisions of this and other courts which have already held that a council of a Tribe or band is a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" within s. 2 of the
Federal Court Act
. Yet they seek to distinguish those cases as dealing with circumstances where the council concerned was a council constituted under s. 74 of the
Indian Act
. (See
Sault v. Mississaugas of the New Credit Indian Band Council
(1989), 25 F.T.R. 241;
Whitefish et al. v. Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development et al.
, [1985] 5 W.W.R. 664 (Sask. Q.B.);
Rider v. Ear et al.
, [1979] 6 W.W.R. 226 (Alta. T.D.).) In the alternative it is urged that the band council was treated as a "federal board" where the activity of the council which gave rise to the proceedings was undertaken pursuant to the
Indian Act
within the powers that may be exercised under that
Act
by a council. Thus, it seems acknowledged by the defendants that the council in this case may be a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" subject to jurisdiction of this court where it exercises authority provided by the
Indian Act
, but it is said not to be such a body where it exercises authority under customary law of the band in relation to Tribe elections.
