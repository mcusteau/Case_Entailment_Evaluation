[26]
The plaintiff urges that if no injunction is awarded at this stage he will suffer irreparable harm pending trial of the serious issues raised by the action, and implicitly that harm will be caused to the Tribe if lawful processes established by the Custom Election Bylaw are not followed. As to the former the defendants say that any harm to the plaintiff is not irreparable since it is redressable by damages by action for wrongful dismissal or for damage to the plaintiff's reputation, but these are said by the plaintiff not to provide redress in a situation where, if he is removed from office unlawfully, he will be precluded from service to the Tribe not merely for the balance of the term to which he was elected but effectively for future services since his reputation will be tarnished in such a way that he could not expect to stand again for election as Chief of the Tribe. The position of Chief is one of great honour within the Tribe and wrongful removal from that office is not compensable in money damages.
