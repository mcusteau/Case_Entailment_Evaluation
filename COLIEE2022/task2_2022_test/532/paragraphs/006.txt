On March 17 a meeting of the council was held to deal with the matter. The plaintiff did not attend but his representative, who was present, indicated that the plaintiff did not attorn to the jurisdiction of council. That meeting adjourned without reaching a decision. Without delay thereafter both parties approached this court, each proposing to seek an interim order enjoining the other from certain activities. After discussion between their counsel with the court, it was resolved that matters would proceed by application by the plaintiff for interim relief by way of an order enjoining the parties from certain activities, and the plaintiff would also file a statement of claim to initiate action in the court. The application for an interim order was heard by telephone conference call by my colleague Mr. Justice Muldoon on March 19 as a result of which he issued an interim injunctive order to preserve the status quo of the parties as the situation was before the steps were initiated to remove the plaintiff from office. The order provided that each of the parties, the Chief and council, remain in office unless deposed by due process of law, or unless he or they resigned of their own free will, and each of the parties was enjoined from deposing or purporting to depose the other except by due process of law. The order included other provisions designed to preserve the status quo, to preserve records of the Tribe, to restore to employment certain staff members whom the Chief had purported to suspend from office or to fire, and to maintain the Shot Both Sides Administration Centre, with its stores, services and facilities, open to the public as well as to the parties. The building had been occupied briefly by the Chief and his supporters after the council had directed his exclusion, and thereafter it had been occupied by the defendants. Locks were said to have been changed at least once and for a time even members of the public had been excluded from this Centre, operated by the Blood Tribe, which contains facilities and stores to serve the general public, in addition to Tribe offices. The situation on the Reserve was said to be volatile between supporters of the parties, with risk of violence and property damage.
