In some respects the exploration of possible resolution of differences by other means has already begun through discussion and agreement on the possibilities of a referendum concerning the continuing status of the plaintiff, and possibly of the defendants. Direction for advice on a referendum process was included in the order of June 7, 1993, and reconfirmed by the order of June 16, a direction that has not yet elicited response. The parties have an opportunity yet to respond to that direction. I urge that they seriously consider all other processes that will assist in the resolution of the differences between them at least insofar as those differences affect the ongoing operations which govern and support the people of the Blood Tribe.
