The issue concerning the court's jurisdiction is said to arise because the defendants' actions here complained of were taken pursuant to the Blood Tribe Custom Election Bylaw, enacted by the Blood Tribe Council in 1982 to state custom of the Blood Tribe respecting elections. In acting under the bylaw it is said the defendants do not constitute a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" within s. 2(1) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 as amended, in relation to which this court has jurisdiction, under s. 18, to grant the relief here sought.
