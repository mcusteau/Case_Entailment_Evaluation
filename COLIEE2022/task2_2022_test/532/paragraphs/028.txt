I am persuaded that if the removal of the plaintiff from office is not restrained for a further period pending resolution of differences between the parties, or a future regular election of Chief and council, or trial of the action here commenced, the plaintiff will indeed suffer irreparable harm in the sense that harm will not be redressable in money damages. Without determining the issues which are not before the court, in my view, he would have no claim to damages for wrongful dismissal and probably no realistic monetary claim for loss of reputation.
