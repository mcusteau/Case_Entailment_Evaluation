If it be considered that continuing the injunction order will accomplish little, the same may be considered to be the case if the order is not continued. The differences between the parties will not disappear and to this stage neither appears prepared to abandon the positions they have respectively adopted. Granting an injunction preserving the status quo in terms of the legal relationship of the parties prior to the events in March 1993 does provide time for the parties to reflect upon their responsibilities and their interests, shared in common, in serving the Blood Tribe through the offices to which they were duly elected. It provides time for them and those who may represent them to explore the interests they share in common, the differences between them and possible compromise of some of those differences. It also provides time for a more thorough consideration of means and procedures that may be acceptable to both to resolve differences between them that concern ongoing operations for the Tribe's affairs, leaving the basic issue giving rise to their dispute, the respective powers of the Chief and the council, to evolve with appropriate involvement of the members of the Blood Tribe.
