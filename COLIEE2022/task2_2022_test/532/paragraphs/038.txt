I sum up my conclusions. The Tribe Council is a "federal board, commission or tribunal" within the
Federal Court Act
and this court has jurisdiction under s. 18 of that
Act
to award the relief here claimed. The court also has jurisdiction to award interim orders in the interests of justice, now under s. 18.2.
