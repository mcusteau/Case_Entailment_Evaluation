[40]
My conclusions about the terms of an injunctive order, after providing opportunity for counsel to comment on the terms, which opportunity I note for the record counsel for the defendants declined, are that
1) An order in the nature of an injunction to preserve the status quo as it was at the beginning of March, in terms of the status of the parties in their respective elective offices should issue, and, after consideration of representations for the plaintiff, for a period until November 2, 1993.
2) General terms of previous orders of the court which are still applicable in the circumstances should be consolidated with modifications appropriate to current conditions, and should be reaffirmed as terms of the interim order now issued, with specific terms of previous orders reaffirmed so far as those are not inconsistent with the terms now issued.
3) The parties are to be directed to consider all possible means of identifying differences that relate to the ongoing administration and governance of the Tribe and to consider all possible means for resolving those differences, for example, by agreement, through the involvement of third parties, perhaps Elders of the Tribe, in processes such as mediation, conciliation or arbitration, or through a referendum or even new elections for all parties.
4) The position of the third party, as Chief of the Tribe Police, should be supported in recognition of his responsibilities for direction of peace officers whose responsibilities are to maintain peace and order, and to protect life and property on the Reserve.
5) Costs of this motion, though requested by the plaintiff, should be costs in the cause.
