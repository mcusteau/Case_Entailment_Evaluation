On March 23, a statement of claim was filed by the plaintiff. On March 25, the Council again met and further considered the process it had initiated to remove the Chief from office. The plaintiff was not present but his representative indicated again that he did not attorn to Council's jurisdiction. It is said that the statement of grounds for removal of the plaintiff from the office of Chief, the statement of March 9, was read, no further presentation was made and no evidence led and council adopted a resolution purporting to remove Chief Frank from office. This led to a further urgent hearing by telephone conference call on March 26, as a result of which my colleague Mr. Justice Teitelbaum issued, on March 29, a further interim order. That order suspended the removal of the plaintiff from the office of Chief until June 21 then scheduled for hearing of the application by the plaintiff for an interlocutory injunction; it enjoined the parties from actions to depose one another from offices; it enjoined all persons, whether parties to the action or not from demonstrations in or within 100 feet of the Shot Both Sides Building on the Reserve at Standoff, Alberta; it included several other provisions to preserve the status quo and to preserve peace on the Reserve.
