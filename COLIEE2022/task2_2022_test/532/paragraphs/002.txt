The proceedings arose in an unfortunate ongoing dispute between the parties, all of whom, except the third party, were duly elected to positions of trust and responsibility, the plaintiff as Chief and the defendants as members of the Band Council of the Blood Tribe. All were elected to a two year term of office at a general election conducted in November 1992 in accord with the Blood Tribe Custom Election Bylaw. I am informed that the Blood Tribe is one of the largest bands of native Indian people in Canada and that its reserve lands, located in southern Alberta, are the largest in the country.
