Continuance of the injunction against the plaintiff's removal from office, pending determination of the validity of the action of the defendants, does not, in itself, do more than maintain the legal status of the plaintiff attained as a result of his election under the Custom Election Bylaw. Continuing arrangements for governance of the Tribe's affairs in the circumstances as they have developed is not directly in issue before the court. It is not unusual for there to be differences of view and even of objectives among members elected to offices who are expected under the law to work together. Expressions of those differences ought not to be interpreted as unwillingness to work together in future in relation to their common interest. In this case that common interest is the good governance and welfare of the Blood Tribe, and each of the parties here implicitly acknowledges that basic interest.
