Subsequently there were further hearings by this court, one by personal appearance and three telephone conference calls, all dealt with by my colleague Mr. Justice Joyal, in May and June in Vancouver. At the oral hearing on May 19 in Vancouver, when the defendants or at least some of them were present, the defendants proposed that there be a referendum on the Reserve to seek to clarify the support of the electorate for continuing the plaintiff, and perhaps the defendants in office. When the plaintiff subsequently agreed through counsel to proposing terms for such a process the defendants, apparently reversing their position, on May 27, acting as council, adopted a resolution, purporting to act under the Custom Election Bylaw, to schedule a byelection for the office of Chief, to take place June 30, and then or subsequently to propose nominations for the office, excluding the plaintiff. On June 7 an order of Mr. Justice Joyal prohibited further action in relation to the resolution providing for a byelection for Chief and it made the agreement respecting holding of a referendum an order of the court, directing the parties to submit draft proposals for a referendum for endorsement by the court. Thereafter, counsel for the plaintiff sought directions in relation to the position of the defendants to schedule a byelection for the office of Chief and not to hold a referendum. Counsel for Wayne Hamby, originally joined as a defendant, sought clarification of his role. As a result on June 16, Mr. Justice Joyal ordered on June 16 that the order of June 7 was reconfirmed, thus restating the direction to the parties to propose terms for a referendum upon which they had earlier agreed, and as earlier noted he ordered that Mr. Hamby be joined as a third party.
