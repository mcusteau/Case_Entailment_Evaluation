In the case of the Blood Tribe its council was elected in accord with the provisions of the
Indian Act
, then applicable, from 1965 until 1976 when, on behalf of the Minister of Indian Affairs, by order, elections to council and the office of Chief were recognized to be thereafter made in accord with the custom of the Tribe. That custom was codified by the Blood Tribe Custom Election Bylaw, adopted in 1982.
