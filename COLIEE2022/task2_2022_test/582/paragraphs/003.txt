Samson plaintiffs in one of the other actions (T-2022-89) have already proceeded with examination for discovery, in relation to oil and gas issues, of a deponent named by the Crown, Mr. James Eickmeier. It is in anticipation that Mr. Eickmeier will also be named by the Crown as its deponent for examination in any discovery by the Ermineskin plaintiffs in regard to oil and gas issues, that those plaintiffs now move for an order that Mr. Moore be named by order of the court to represent the Crown. Their anticipation about the likelihood of the nomination of Mr. Eickmeier by the Crown was not disputed in argument. I note that in argument on this application, the plaintiffs were supported by the Samson plaintiffs and by the Enoch plaintiffs engaged in the parallel actions.
