Mr. Eickmeier was an employee of the Crown who worked with senior responsibilities in the Indian Oil and Gas unit from 1987 to 1991. Like Mr. Moore, he is now retired from the public service, but he also continues to work from time to time under contracts with the Crown. Since January, 1994 he has been engaged on contract in relation to this litigation, primarily in the preparation for, attendance at, and follow-up in fulfilling undertakings arising from his examination for discovery by Samson plaintiffs as the deponent of the Crown in relation to oil and gas issues. In some early sessions of that examination Mr. Moore reportedly attended with Mr. Eickmeier and the latter sought advice from Mr. Moore before responding to some questions but that practice did not long continue.
