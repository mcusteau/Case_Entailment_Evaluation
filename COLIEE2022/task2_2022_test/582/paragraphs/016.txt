In my opinion, those cases must be read in light of rule 465(1)(c) as it then applied, which provided for "questioning any departmental or other officer of the Crown nominated by the Attorney General ... or by order of the court". Rule 456(3) now provides for naming of the deponent by the Crown, and under rule 456(4) for the court "on the application of a party entitled to examine the person selected under paragraph ... (3) [to] order that some other person be examined". It seems clear to me that this means a two step process, a determination about who shall be nominated as deponent for the Crown to be made by the Attorney General or his deputy, and only thereafter possible intervention by the court. It is unlikely that intervention would be exercised unless it were to be demonstrated that the nominee of the Crown is not informed, or capable of being informed, of the facts essential to the issues upon which discovery is pursued.
