It is of passing interest in this case that neither Mr. Moore, nor Mr. Eickmeier qualify as an "officer, servant or employee" of the Crown in a strict or narrow sense, both having left full-time employment in the public service some years ago. Yet each continues to serve the Crown on a contract basis, and each has a measure of experience from his former service which would qualify him as a deponent. The one difference in current contract arrangements would appear to be that while both are retained for assistance in preparation for the trial in this litigation, only Mr. Eickmeier appears to have a contract under which he is to serve as the Crown's deponent in examination for discovery. That role, it is said in argument, Mr. Moore is unwilling to assume.
