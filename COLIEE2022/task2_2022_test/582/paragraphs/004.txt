The basis of the plaintiffs' application arises from the comparative lengths of service with the Crown's management of oil and gas reserves of Messrs. Moore and Eickmeier, from a general similarity in terms of the ongoing relationships of both men to the Crown's operations, and from the pattern said by the plaintiffs to have evolved in the discovery of Mr. Eickmeier as conducted by Samson plaintiffs. While they are plaintiffs in the concurrent action, T-2022-89, the examination for discovery of Mr. Eickmeier is to serve all three bands, though both Ermineskin plaintiffs and Enoch plaintiffs expect to ask questions in discovery on oil and gas issues particular to their respective claims in their concurrent actions.
