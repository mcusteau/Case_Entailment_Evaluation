In the only analogous case to which I have found reference, dealing with the comparable provisions of current rule 456 concerning naming of deponents for corporations under para. (2) and the possible intervention of the court under para. (4), Mr. Justice Muldoon construed the process as a two-step process:
Richter Gedeon Vegy√©szeti Gyar RT v. Merck & Co. et al.
(1994), 87 F.T.R. 230 (T.D.). He dismissed an application by defendants for an order naming certain persons to be deponents of the plaintiff corporation essentially on the ground the motion was premature, where plaintiffs offered to name two representatives as deponents and there was no evidence that those nominees would be ineffective or unsuitable. In his view, the defendants in that case
"... must be content with the plaintiff's first selection, or in this case the generous two selections, unless they can persuade the plaintiff, without compulsion, to reconsider. The plaintiff is not obliged to do so. If the persons whom the plaintiff initially selected turn out to be uninformed or only poorly informed, then the defendants would be entitled to invoke rule 456(4). The defendants' motion here is premature. It will accordingly, be dismissed. Another time, the defendants will require cogent evidence that some person, other than one selected by the plaintiff is really needed. ..." (authorities omitted)
