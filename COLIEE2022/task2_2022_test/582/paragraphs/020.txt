I am persuaded in the circumstances of this case that Mr. Moore, from his direct experience from 1965 to 1981 may be expected to be the better informed, of the two persons here considered as possible deponents, about oil and gas issues arising in those years. Undoubtedly even he must have to review documents to refresh his memory of facts and events as long as 30 years ago. I would urge that the Crown here give serious consideration to seeking arrangements with Mr. Moore for him to be deponent of the Crown in relation to those issues in the years 1965 to 1981. They are not the only issues or the only years of significance in these actions and another deponent or deponents would obviously be required. If this could facilitate the process of examination for discovery to any significant degree, that would assist all parties in this case.
