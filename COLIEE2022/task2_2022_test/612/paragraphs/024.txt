The NEB is clearly a named federal board, commission or tribunal within s. 28(1)(f). Therefore, should there be a judicial review application of any of its decisions, it must be in the Federal Court of Appeal. This court has no jurisdiction to hear the application T-8-99 insofar as the applicant, Rocky Mountain, seeks an order to set aside or quash the decision of the NEB. Application T-8-99 is bereft of any chance of success.
