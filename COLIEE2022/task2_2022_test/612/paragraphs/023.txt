The power of the Trial Division contemplated in the s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
is specifically subject to s. 28. By s. 28 the jurisdiction to hear judicial review applications against specified federal boards, commissions or other tribunals lies only with the Federal Court of Appeal. Section 28(3) expressly provides that the Trial Division is deprived of jurisdiction in respect of judicial review against federal boards and tribunals over which the Federal Court of Appeal entertains jurisdiction. Section 28 reads in part:
"28(1)
Judicial Review
- The Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for judicial review made in respect of any of the following federal boards, commissions or other tribunals:
. . . . .
(f) the
National Energy Board
established by the
National Energy Board Act
;
. . . . .
"(3)
Trial Division Deprived of jurisdiction
- Where the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction to hear and determine any matter, the Trial Division has no jurisdiction to entertain any proceeding in respect of the same matter."
