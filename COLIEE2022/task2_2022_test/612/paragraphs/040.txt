[40]
Mandamus is appropriate only when there was a "proper" demand and when that demand was refused. For example, if the applicant fails to comply with all the conditions necessary for performance of a duty or if it demands a performance of otherwise appropriate duty through incorrect procedure, mandamus will not be granted.
