The public hearing commenced on 6 January, 1998 and went on for 77 days primarily at the NEB's offices in Calgary. There was also occasion for some regional hearings to facilitate the participation of the persons living in the areas directly affected by the project. Rocky Mountain, a non-profit organization with a mandate to preserve environmental integrity, registered as an interested party. It actively participated, conducting cross-examinations and making submissions to the NEB panel.
