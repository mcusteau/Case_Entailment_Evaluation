The extent of the project is substantial: just the Canadian portion of the project encompasses construction of approximately 1565 km of main pipelines, 770 km of lateral pipelines (the latter reaching north of Fort St. John, B.C.) and related facilities. The Canadian portion of the main line extends from a location near Gordondale in Northwestern Alberta to a point near Elmore, Saskatchewan where it joins the American portion of the system. The pipeline crosses over 500 streams and rivers. The entire pipeline system is estimated to cost $3.7 billion with the Canadian portion being allotted $2 billion. The system is scheduled to be in service by the second half of the year 2000, and once completed, it will be capable of delivering 37.5 million cubic metres of natural gas per day.
