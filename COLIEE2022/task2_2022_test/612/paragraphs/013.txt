Rocky Mountain says the exchange of information between DFO and Alliance, outside the hearing process, effectively precluded the NEB panel from obtaining relevant and important information for the purpose of making a decision. Rocky Mountain requested the NEB to require Alliance to produce witnesses with knowledge of the discussions with DFO, but its request was denied on the basis that Rocky Mountain should have asked DFO and PFRA to make available the specific witnesses for the hearing first, and only when that request was denied, would they have been entitled to come before the panel for issuance of subpoenas. Not having done so, the NEB advised that it was in no position to intervene (AGC's record Vol. II, p. 516).
