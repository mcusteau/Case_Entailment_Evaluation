"The presence of a discretion to act or not, or to act in one of a number of ways, will preclude the issue of mandamus since there will be no specific duty to act in a particular way.":
Brown and Evans
, supra, at p. 1-39. Mandamus cannot issue where the complaint involves the manner in which a minister performs his or her duties. This is especially so if the statute vests a discretion in the minister with respect to performance of those duties. In other words, the decision of the ministers must be purely "ministerial" and not "administrative," the difference there being the discretionary capacity. The AGC referred the court to
Distribution Canada Inc. v. M.N.R.
, (supra). The Federal Court of Appeal in
Distribution Canada
decided that the word "shall", as used in the
Customs Tariff
, was indicative of the Minster's discretion and, as long as the Minister was not in dereliction of his general duty to impose tariff, mandamus could not issue to compel the minister to decide on a particular manner of imposing a tariff. The same reasoning is applicable here. In the event that DFO and PFRA are federal authorities with expert information, the
CEA Act
leaves open how the information is to be provided to the NEB. Alternately, if the NEB, DFO and PFRA are all responsible authorities, each capable of setting up a commission to review the project, the
CEA Act
by its wording leaves open the manner in which responsible authorities are to cooperate in the assessment of a project: they cannot be forced by mandamus to decide this in any particular way. All of this is purely discretionary. Rocky Mountain is essentially asking for an order compelling DFO and PFRA, despite their discretion, to act or to cooperate in a very particular manner.
