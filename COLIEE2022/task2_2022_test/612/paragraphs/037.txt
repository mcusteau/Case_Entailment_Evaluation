The outcome might have been very different had the NEB requested information from DFO and PFRA. The wording of s. 12 indicates that DFO and PFRA owe a duty to the NEB to make expert information available. However, the NEB did not request the information. The NEB in its ruling indicates to Rocky Mountain that it is in the NEB's discretion to conduct a hearing as long as there is sufficient material and information to proceed with it. The NEB specifically expressed that it does not require every piece of relevant information to be submitted before a hearing can proceed. If Rocky Mountain has any difficulties with this view it should take up the issue by way of review of the NEB decision and not by way of a proceeding seeking mandamus against DFO and PFRA.
