To further emphasize the point, I would note the decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in
Oil, Chemical & Atomic Workers International Union, Local 9-649 et al. v. Nicol
(1965), 52 W.W.R.(N.S.) 434 (Sask. C.A.). In
Nicol
the Chief Justice, writing for the court, considered whether a labour board constituted to investigate dismissal of a union worker should have, by writ of mandamus, compelled the employer to produce certain privileged documents at the hearing. The court rejected the applicant's contention on the basis that a provision in the
Trade Union Act
and related
Regulations
gave the Board discretion to "accept, admit and call for such evidence as in equity and good conscience it thinks fit, whether strictly legal evidence or not," and that the refusal to produce the privileged documents did not constitute a violation of fundamental natural justice in that case. (p. 438) As applied here, DFO and PFRA had a certain degree of discretion as to how they might, as responsible authorities, cooperate in the hearing procedure. Section 12 of the
CEA Act
also allows similar discretion to DFO and to PFRA as federal authorities with specialist information, in that they need only produce information in their possession upon request. The question of how they cooperate in relation to the general assessment hearing process was clearly in their discretion. Mandamus will not issue in such an instance.
