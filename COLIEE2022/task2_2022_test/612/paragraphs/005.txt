The AGC submits in respect of the second application, T-9-99: (1) that this court has no jurisdiction to hear Rocky Mountain's application since it does not seek to review a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal as defined in the
Federal Court Act
; and (2) that the relief sought by Rocky Mountain is in the nature of mandamus to compel a public authority to make a particular decision, but that this court cannot provide such relief in reviewing discretionary decision of the public authority, such relief not being available at law. I have decided this motion on the second issue, the availability of mandamus.
