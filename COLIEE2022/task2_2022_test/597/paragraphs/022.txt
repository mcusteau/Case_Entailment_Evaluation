There was evidence both before the citizenship judge and before me that the appellant had been an active promoter of Canadian interest in Hong Kong - acting as a contact person there for Canadian businesses and politicians. He had also been involved, in Canada, in helping lobby the Canadian government to obtain changes in the tax laws and thereby make it more attractive for international shipping companies to locate in Vancouver. Such tax changes were in fact implemented in 1991 and at least one Swedish shipping firm has relocated to Vancouver. One moved from Long Beach, California too. In 1991, the appellant was appointed to the Advisory Board of the Canada-Asia Transportation and Trade Forum. This is part of the Asia Pacific Foundation and has as its objective the fostering of business opportunities from the Pacific Rim.
