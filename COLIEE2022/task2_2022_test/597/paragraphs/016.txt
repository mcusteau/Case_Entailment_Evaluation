Prior to their arrival as landed immigrants, the appellant's wife bought a residence in West Vancouver. She bought the house in December of 1986 and moved into those premises in July of 1987. Ownership of this property was transferred, approximately one year after the appellant and his wife had been landed in Canada, to joint ownership by the appellant and his wife. This was the first time the appellant had personally owned real estate anywhere. In Hong Kong, he and his family lived in rented accommodation provided by the family-owned shipping company, of which the appellant is the chief executive officer. The appellant continues to live in this accommodation when in Hong Kong.
