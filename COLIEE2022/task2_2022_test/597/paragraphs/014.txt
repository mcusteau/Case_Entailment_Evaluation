I have reviewed carefully much of the jurisprudence respecting the residence requirements of the
Citizenship Act
because this appellant very much wants to become a Canadian citizen. He and his family fled to Hong Kong from mainland China (Shanghai) in May of 1949. This was a result of the political upheaval which was taking place in that country at that time. Many of the assets of his family's shipping business were lost when they fled. The family rebuilt their business in Hong Kong. The appellant does not have a passport but travels on a Certificate of Identity issued by the Hong Kong government. He and his family are clearly concerned about what 1997 might bring.
