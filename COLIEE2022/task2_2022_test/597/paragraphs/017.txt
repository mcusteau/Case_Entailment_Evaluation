[17]
Subsequent to May 10, 1987, the appellant's wife spent the requisite 1095 days physically present in Canada and has now been granted Canadian citizenship. She and her husband have recently sold the West Vancouver residence and purchased a condominium in Kerrisdale. I note in passing that because the appellant's wife did not have business responsibilities abroad similar to those of her husband she was able to fulfil the 1095 day residence requirement and is now free to spend as much time abroad as she wishes. The appellant has an uncle, an aunt, a cousin, his mother-in-law and his younger brother living in Vancouver.
