A review of the cases reveals that a number of different formulations of the appropriate test have been set out. In
Re Leung
(1991), 42 F.T.R. 149, at p. 153, it was said that:
"... an applicant who has established a residence in Canada, even if only a rented room, leaves Canada, even for extended periods, to complete studies abroad, because of business transfers, or, as in the case of missionaries or people in the foreign service, temporary postings abroad ... periods so spent abroad can be counted to fulfill [sic] the residence requirements ...
but when
on the [other] hand,
the absences are for purely personal reasons and of a voluntary nature they cannot be so counted
." (underlining added)
The applicant was held not to have fulfilled the residence requirement because she had chosen to go abroad, because she had:
"followed a business strategy that required me to work outside of Canada [as a public relations consultant] in order to provide me with better opportunities in Canada." (At p. 5 of the decision.)
The applicant was held not to have fulfilled the residence requirements even though the judge did not "have any doubt that it is her intention to make Canada her home." He also noted, at p. 9:
"Many Canadian citizens, whether Canadian born or naturalized must spend a large part of their time abroad in connection with their businesses, and this is their choice. An applicant for citizenship, however, does not have such freedom because of the provisions of s. 5(1) of the
Act
."
