In some decisions it has been suggested that the changes in the
Citizenship Act
which were made in 1978 lead to the conclusion that Parliament intended that physical presence for the whole three year period was not required. This is said to be related to the removal from the
Act
of qualifications based on domicile. I have read the Parliamentary debates and committee proceedings of that period and can find nothing to substantiate that conclusion. Indeed, quite the contrary seems to be the case. The requirement of three year residence within a four year period seems to have been designed to allow for one year's physical absence during the four year period. Certainly, the debates of the period suggest that physical presence in Canada for 1095 days was contemplated as a minimum. In any event, as has been noted above, the jurisprudence which is now firmly entrenched does not require physical presence for the whole 1095 days.
