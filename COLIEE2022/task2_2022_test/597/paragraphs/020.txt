The appellant employed a consulting firm to assist with his application for citizenship. The citizenship judge commented on correspondence which had been received from this firm and then described some of the factors which exist in the appellant's case: factors relevant in considering the quality of the appellant's connection with Canada; factors relevant for determining whether or not an individual will be considered to be resident within Canada even though physically absent. I will quote from the citizenship judge's decision since much of the same evidence was presented before me:
"Your consulting company, following the initial interview, provided the court with further documentation as well, as requested by Mrs. Glover, the Officer handling this application.
"You travel with a certificate of identity, issued by the Hong Kong Government because you are stateless. The certificate of identity presented to the court expires November 4, 1992.
"You entered Canada under the NV3 category through Employment and Immigration Canada.
"Prior to your arrival in Canada, you had opened an account with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce at 1502 Marine Drive, West Vancouver, B.C. Mrs. Anna Koo, even previous to this date, had purchased property in West Vancouver, B.C. on December 6, 1986, five months prior to your initial landing in Canada. This property remained in your wife's name, Mrs. Anna Koo, until a Transfer of an Estate and Fee Simple was processed on May 6, 1988 (one year after landing) to you, Mr. David Koo and your wife, Mrs. Anna Koo, as Joint Tenants.
"You applied for and obtained upon entry, a Social Insurance Card, B.C. Medical coverage, B.C. Driver's License, Visa and Mastercard through Canadian Plus.
"I was informed by you that you are an individual member (since 1987) of the Canadian Plus President's Club (which you said was because of your extensive travelling). Also, you are a member of the B.C.A.A. You have held a Corporate membership since July of 1990 with the Hong Kong Canadian Business Association and attend these meetings in Hong Kong, not Vancouver. For your children, you took out an individual membership in the West Vancouver Tennis Club (October 1990) and an individual membership in the Terminal City Club. You and Mrs. Koo also obtained membership cards for the West Vancouver Memorial Library in 1991. [Tennis club and library cards have now expired or become not useful with the appellant's move to Kerrisdale. The appellant stated that a new library card would be sought in Kerrisdale.]
"In regard to your business investments in Canada, documentation was provided showing that on September 29, 1987, you incorporated Erindale Holdings Ltd., with yourself as President. On March 25, 1988, there was an investment in joint venture between Park Georgia and Erindale Holdings Ltd. Corporate income tax returns were filed with the real estate market. Two and a half years after the initial entry as a Landed Immigrant, on October 27, 1989, incorporation of No. 66 Taurus Ventures Ltd. (named [sic] changed to Sureness Holding Inc., March 7, 1990) transpired. You have been the Secretary of this company since November 13, 1989. You informed me at your hearing that this company is a 'family' company and owns an office building in Burnaby, B.C.
"On November 27, 1989, (two and a half years after initial landing) Valles Steamship (Canada) Ltd., was incorporated with you as the Secretary since December 28, 1989. This is a shell company of your family business Valles Steamship Company Ltd., you informed me.
"You have purchased numerous Retirement Savings Plans, through the Canadian Imperial Bank of Canada, since 1988. Income tax returns have been filed by you for the years 1987, 1988 and 1989 [as well as 1990 and 1991].
"Seven letters in support of your application for citizenship were reviewed. They were from Mr. Derril T. Warren, Q.C., Executive Director of the Vancouver Centre for Commercial Disputes; Mr. Richard H. Vogel, President, Western Opportunities Ltd.; Mr. L.M. Little, Q.C., Thorsteinssons; Mr. Cecil O.D. Branson, Q.C., Edwards, Kenny and Bray; Mr. Peter D. Larlee, Edwards, Kenny and Bray; Mr. R.E. Lawless, President and CEO, Canadian National, and Mr. Richard H. Vogel, Director, Secretariat - Overseas Shipping Ltd.,
"Each writer acknowledged the work done by you, Mr. Koo, in promoting interest in shipping companies relocating in Canada, rather than other deep sea ports somewhere else in the world and also credited you for assisting the lobbying process to have the Income Tax Law rewritten with our Canadian parliamentarians. Each writer stated they felt that you would have much to offer Canada as a Canadian and you would make an excellent citizen.
"Newspaper articles and clippings from papers, magazines and such from publications in Hong Kong and Canada were reviewed. They dealt with the proposed changes in the Canadian Income Tax Law."
