As has been noted, the appellant was credited by the citizenship judge with having been physically present in Canada for 232 of the required 1095 days. I will adopt that calculation although it is not immediately apparent that it accurately reflects the actual time spent in Canada. The calculation prepared by the Department of the Secretary of State, for example, states that his absence from February 2, 1990 to April 28, 1990 comprised 49 days. That absence in fact would seem to have exceeded 80 days. Another example of the troublesome calculations is found with respect to the November 2, 1990 to February 11, 1991 period. This was assessed as an absence of 73 days. It would appear to be closer to 110 days. I did not raise these discrepancies with counsel, when counsel were before me, and thus for the purpose of my decision have used the 232 day figure. As has been noted, this number of days was accumulated by numerous short periods of time spent in Canada, most being not much longer than a week in duration.
