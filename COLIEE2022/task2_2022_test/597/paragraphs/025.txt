Counsel for the appellant argues that, in any event, the citizenship judge erred because she did not make a recommendation to the Minister pursuant to s. 5(4) of the
Citizenship Act
("5(4) In order to alleviate cases of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Governor-in-Council may, in his discretion, direct the Minister to grant citizenship to any person and, where such a direction is made, the Minister shall forthwith grant citizenship to the person named in the direction.) that the appellant should be granted citizenship "to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada". There is jurisprudence which discusses the jurisdiction of both citizenship judges and judges of the Federal Court to make recommendations to the Minister in this regard. In my opinion, it is open to either a citizenship judge or a judge of the Federal Court to make such a recommendation. That being said, however, I do not see how a reviewing court could censor a citizenship judge for failing to recommend to the Minister that citizenship be granted pursuant to s. 5(4).
