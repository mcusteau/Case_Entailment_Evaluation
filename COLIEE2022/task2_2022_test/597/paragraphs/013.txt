I have reviewed some of the residence requirements which exist in the citizenship legislation of some other countries (United Kingdom, United States and Australia). While these are not directly relevant to the interpretation of the Canadian Act, I was interested to ascertain whether other members of the international community have adopted a test of residency for citizenship which allows what might be called dual residence (equal connection in two countries). While the legislation in some of these countries differs from Canada's in that the grant of citizenship is discretionary and not a right following upon certain qualifications having been met, I did not find a dual residence concept in use.
