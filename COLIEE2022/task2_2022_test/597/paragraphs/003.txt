Reference was made in
Re Papadogiorgakis
to the Supreme Court decision in
Thomson v. M.N.R.
, [1946] S.C.R. 209. In that case the concept "ordinarily resident" was discussed for tax purposes, at pp. 224-225:
"It is held to mean
residence in the course of the customary mode of life of the person concerned, and it is contrasted with special or occasional or casual residence
. The general mode of life is, therefore, relevant to a question of its application.
"For the purposes of income tax legislation, it must be assumed that every person has at all times a residence ...
"But in the different situations of so-called 'permanent residence', 'temporary residence', 'ordinary residence', 'principal residence' and the like, the adjectives do not affect the fact that there is in all cases residence; and
that quality is chiefly a matter of the degree to which a person in mind and fact settles into or maintains or centralizes his ordinary mode of living with its accessories in social relations, interests and conveniences at or in the place in question
. It may be limited in time from the outset, or it may be indefinite, or so far as it is thought of, unlimited. On the lower level,
the expressions involving residence should be distinguished
, as I think they are in ordinary speech,
from the field of 'stay' or 'visit'
." (underlining added)
