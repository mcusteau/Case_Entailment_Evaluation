I have difficulty with that admonition. If it means that the requirements of the
Act
are to be interpreted differently for a person about whom the judge has formed a good opinion (as a potential citizen) from that which applies to a person about whom the judge has not formed this opinion, then, I find I have to reject the rule of interpretation. The same criteria are required to be met by all applicants regardless of the judge's opinion on the individual's qualities as a potential citizen. The law should be applied equally to all.
