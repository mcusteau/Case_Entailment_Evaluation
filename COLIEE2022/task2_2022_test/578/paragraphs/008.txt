During this period the Band was experi­encing internal problems. A new Chief had been elected on February 28, 1992; the Band Manager, Mr. John Joe had been dismissed in late April; Mr. Bob Sam was asked by the Chief to perform the duties of Band Man­ager in the interim; Mr. Sam was on leave of absence during May; Mr. Joe launched legal proceedings and was reinstated in early June; during the intervening period there were misunderstandings between Mr. Sam and Mr. Joe; all in all the management of the Band and the Council was chaotic.
