On June 12, 1992, a facsimile communi­cation was sent to the Band office advising that the hearing was to take place on June 24, 1992. Having received no reply, on June 17, 1992, the Band was served with a sub­poena instructing it to produce documents and other essential information. The Chief, who had been away, was made aware of its contents on June 19, 1992. He instructed Mr. Sam to contact lawyers and arrange to have the matter postponed. He would be unable to attend the hearing since he was on his way on June 21st to New Brunswick to attend a summit Assembly of First Nations Chiefs to discuss the impending Charlottetown accord.
