Following a hearing on June 24, 1992, and in a decision dated July 8, 1992, the Adjudicator ordered that the respondent be re-instated to his position. Following receipt of this determination, no one having appeared on behalf of the Band, a request was submitted by the Band, seeking both a re-opening of the hearing or an opportunity to submit evidence of the dismissal they alleged was for cause. A second decision was rendered in January of 1993, in which the Adjudicator refused to re-open the matter and found, among other things, that she was functus officio.
