In light of the solicitor for Mr. Charlie having been awarded costs in the first arbi­tration and in view of the fact that this application for Judicial Review was actually brought about because of the negligence of the applicant, and though they have met with success, I nevertheless find that the re­spondent's counsel should be awarded costs. Pursuant to Rule 1618 costs may only be awarded for special reasons. I am satisfied, that because of the conduct of these appli­cants, costs should be allowed.
