Because the "issue" regarding the divergence of opinion in Federal Court jurisprudence with respect to the residency requirement of the
Act
inevitably surfaces during argument on citizenship appeals, I believe that it is beneficial to distinguish between the instances when that issue has relevance and when it does not. In my view, the "issue" regarding the divergence of
opinion in Federal Court jurisprudence is not relevant to the issue of whether an appellant has established a residence in Canada. In
Goudimenko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] F.T.R. Uned. 286; [2002] F.C.J. No. 581 (T.D.), 2002 FCT 447, the appellant argued that his absences for school ought to have been deemed residence. At paragraph 13, I stated:
"The difficulty with the appellant's reasoning is that it fails to address the threshold issue, his establishment of residence in Canada. Unless the threshold test is met, absences from Canada are irrelevant;
Canada (Secretary of State) v. Yu
(1995), 31 Imm. L.R.(2d) 248 (F.C.T.D.);
Re Papadorgiorgakis
, supra;
Re Koo
, supra;
Re Choi
, [1997] F.C.J. No. 740 (T.D.). In other words, a two stage inquiry exists with respect to the residence requirements of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the
Act
. At the first stage, the threshold determination is made as to whether or not, and when, residence in Canada has been established. If residence has not been established, the matter ends there. If the threshold has been met, the second stage of the inquiry requires a determination of whether or not the particular applicant's residency satisfied the required total days of residence. It is with respect to the second stage of the inquiry, and particularly with regard to whether absences can be deemed residence, that the divergence of opinion in the Federal Court exists."
