I do not regard the reasoning in
Re Koo
, supra, as a deviation from that basic premise. In my view,
Re Koo
stands for the proposition that absences may be deemed residence if an individual has centralized his or her existence here. The phrase "centralized his existence", of necessity, requires that an individual has
established
his or her residence in Canada. If so, the phrase may also be relevant with respect to whether the individual has maintained his or her existence in Canada. The factors enunciated in
Re Koo
were offered as guidelines to assist in the determination of whether absences during the relevant time period can be deemed residence. They do not constitute a test that requires an exhaustive analysis of each and every segment of each and every factor.
