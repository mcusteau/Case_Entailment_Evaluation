I turn now to the appellant's argument that the citizenship judge's reasons and analysis are insufficient and inadequate. The requirement to provide reasons, in the specific context of citizenship applications, was described by Lutfy J., as he then was, in
Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 164 F.T.R. 177 (T.D.), as an obligation to give "clear reasons which demonstrate an understanding of the case law". In
Lai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2000), 188 F.T.R. 113 (T.D.), Pelletier, J., as he then was, adopted the reasoning of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in
Boyle v. Workplace Health, Safety and Compensation Commission (N.B.)
(1996), 179 N.B.R.(2d) 43; 455 A.P.R. 43 (C.A.), wherein it was held that merely listing the evidence considered was not sufficient. Reasons must explain to the parties why the tribunal decided as it did and must also be sufficient to enable the appeal court to discharge its appellate function.
