Dr. Ahmed filed an application for citizenship on December 3, 1999. He was interviewed by the citizenship judge on April 30, 2001 and by correspondence dated May 15, 2001 the citizenship judge refused the application on the basis that the appellant had not met the residence requirements under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 (the
Act
). Paragraph 5(1)(c) requires that a person applying for citizenship accumulate, within the four years immediately preceding the date of the application, at least three years of residence in Canada. In short, a person requires 1095 days of residence in the four year period preceding the application.
