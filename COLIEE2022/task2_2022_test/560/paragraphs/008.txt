The visa officer found that the applicant did not meet the definition of self-employed person, because she was not satisfied the applicant had the ability to establish a business in Canada, and thereby, to become self-supporting. The visa officer said that the extent of the applicant's self-employed experience was not clear. With respect, as I have said, I think it was the visa officer who may have misunderstood. The information provided by the applicant as to her self-employed status is quite clear.
