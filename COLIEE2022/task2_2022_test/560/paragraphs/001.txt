Rothstein, J.
: This is a judicial review from a January 29, 1997 decision of a visa officer refusing the applicant's application for immigration to Canada on the grounds that the applicant does not meet the requirements of the self-employment category. The applicant applied for immigration as a "medical acupuncturist". Apparently no licence to practice acupuncture is required in Ontario where the applicant intended to reside.
