In the material before me, there were three versions of the Rehabilitation Centre's letter of August 12, 1996. Apparently, the first two versions were sent to the visa officer in error. Applicant's counsel advised that the first two versions were drafts and the third is the one that should have been considered by the visa officer. The first version states "we would be glad to employ her" (the applicant). The second version states "we would be glad to retain her as a freelance acupuncturist". The final version states "we would be glad to refer her some patients". Applicant's counsel advised that the revisions were made by his office. The visa officer had the first two versions of the letter. The final version was not forwarded to the court as part of the tribunal record, although applicant's counsel says it should have been before the visa officer. In her affidavit the visa officer states:
"Given the close relationship the applicant had established with the Sheppard Rehabilitation Centre, I had doubts as to whether the applicant was in fact planning to rely on employment through the Sheppard Rehabilitation Centre, rather than intending to set up her own self-employed business. However, this letter from the Sheppard Centre was the only evidence presented by the applicant indicating any sort of business plan in Canada. It was ambiguous."
