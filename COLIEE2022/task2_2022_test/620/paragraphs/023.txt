With respect, the proper inquiry is whether an applicant has the ability to establish himself or herself in his or her occupation or business in Canada. Inherent in the requirements of subsection 8(4) of the Act and the definition of self-employed person, when read together, is that the successful establishment of the applicant in his or her occupation or business will create an employment opportunity for the applicant and make a significant contribution to the economy and the cultural or artistic life of Canada.
