[35]
In my view, absent a request by an applicant, or facts that suggest some good reason why a unit of assessment determination would not properly reflect the chance of an applicant's successful establishment in Canada, a visa officer has no general duty to consider the exercise of positive discretion under subsection 11(3) of the
Regulations
