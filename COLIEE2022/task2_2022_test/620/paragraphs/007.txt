In the refusal letter the officer wrote:
"I have not awarded you the 30 unit bonus because you were unable to demonstrate that you meet the definition of a Self-Employed person. According to Canada's
Immigration Regulations, 1978
, a Self-Employed immigrant is 'a person who intends and has the ability to establish or purchase a business in Canada that will create employment opportunity for himself or herself and will make a significant contribution to the economy or the cultural or artistic life of Canada'. Specifically, you were unable to satisfy this officer that you have the intent and the ability to open a business in Canada or that it would create a significant contribution to the economy.
"You claimed at interview that you have worked as an insurance agent here in the United States since 1998, working for MetLife. Your tax returns from this period confirm your employment and salary with this company which was listed at $25,000 per annum. You confirmed at interview that you were employed with this company on a commission basis and your business plan for Canada was to work as an insurance agent in the same capacity as you have worked in the US. You claimed you would be based in your employer's office and be provided with the necessary tools to conduct your business, such as phone lines, prospective clients, etc. You intend to work for several companies thereby enabling you to provide different plans to your customers.
"You were unable to show how you had the intent to establish yourself in Canada as a self-employed person as described in the Canadian Immigration Act. You do not have any intention of establishing or purchasing a business, but rather you intend to work as an employee of an insurance company and work on a commission basis. If the expected salary in Canada would be similar to your earnings in the US, and there is no indication it would be significantly higher, in my opinion, that would not constitute a significant benefit to the Canadian economy."
