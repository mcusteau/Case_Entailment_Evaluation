The applicant had given the visa officer some evidence that he had relevant experience. His computer-related experience consisted of over one year with Arksystems Inc. and over one year with Panama Goldencare Foundation Inc. Evidence relating to one or both of these jobs must have provided the visa officer with a sufficient basis to award the applicant 10 points for the occupational factor for NOC 2162. To conclude that the same evidence did not prove that he had at least one year of experience related to NOC 2162 makes no sense.
