The central issue raised by the state­ment of claim and the defence is whether the plaintiff is entitled to a monopoly in Canada in the use of the word "eco" in connection with permeable concrete paving stones. This will depend on whether the word, which has a meaning in ordinary speech, is associated in the construction industry with the plain­tiff's paving stones, so that if it is used by the defendant in connection with theirs it is likely to cause confusion, even if other parts of the marks are quite difficult.
