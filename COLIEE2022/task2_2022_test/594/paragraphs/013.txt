It seems to me that the dominant trend in the jurisprudence of this court has been to interpret liberally the rules governing sumÂ­mary judgment, so that a motions judge must subject the evidence to a "hard look" in order to determine whether there are factual issues that really do require the kind of assessment and weighing of evidence that should properly be done by the trier of fact.
