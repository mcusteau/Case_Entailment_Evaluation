In regard to procedural issues:
1) In my opinion it is not inappropriate to consider an application for judicial review of a report and conclusion of the SIRC arising from its investigation following a report under s. 39(2) of the
Act
, especially where, as in this case, the decision of the Governor General-in-Council that a certificate be issued under s. 40(1) of the
Act
is based on the SIRC report and conclusion.
2) On the basis of written submissions of the Attorney General of Canada on behalf of the respondents named in IMM-2197-94, i.e., the Governor General-in-Council and the Solicitor General of Canada, submissions not pressed or responded to at the hearing, but which seem to this court appropriate, the parties named as respondents are struck off the record and the Attorney General of Canada is substituted as the proper respondent in that application. The order issuing directs that the style of cause be so altered, as it is at the commencement of these reasons. I note that in the application in IMM-4557-93 the order issuing includes the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration now responsible for the
Immigration Act
, in place of the Minister originally named by an earlier title.
3) I find that the issue of alleged contravention of s. 15 of the
Charter
, referred to briefly in written submissions of the applicant and of the respondents in IMM-4557-93 prior to the hearing of these applications, was not here raised in the applicant's case as presented at the hearing of these applications and in those circumstances, it may not be raised by an intervenor. Moreover, in this case I also find that no adequate evidentiary basis was made out to support a challenge to s. 19(1)(g) based on s. 15 of the
Charter
.
In regard to administrative law issues:
4) I am not persuaded that the SIRC report and conclusion erred in its findings of fact or erred in law in any manner warranting intervention of the court. In my opinion, SIRC's consideration of the evidence did not significantly misunderstand, misstate or ignore evidence presented, nor were its primary conclusions unreasonable on the basis of the evidence.
5) In my opinion, SIRC did not err in law in its interpretation of s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
, in regard to the words "member" or "likely", or in regard to the standard of proof implied in that provision.
6) In my opinion, no principle of fairness was breached by the determination of the Governor General-in-Council that a certificate be issued under s. 40(1) of the
Act
without providing an opportunity for the applicant to make further submissions, particularly as in this case the Governor General-in-Council expressly acted on the basis of the SIRC report and conclusion.
In regard to constitutional issues:
7) In my opinion the argument raised that the SIRC process here followed contravenes s. 7 of the
Charter
is not open to consideration by the court in view of the determinations by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Chiarelli
, and by the Court of Appeal in
Canepa
and in
Hoang
. Further, in my opinion, the particular aspects of SIRC's processes objected to in this case do not significantly abridge the principles of fundamental justice at common law aside from the
Charter
, in the context of this case. Thus, the decision not to disclose all the evidence presented, the refusal to arrange for counsel for the applicant to have appropriate security clearance and to be admitted to hearings determined by SIRC to be in camera and ex parte for receiving certain evidence of CSIS officers, and the SIRC rules and policy for circulation of a draft report, before it is adopted in final form, to all members of the committee including those who did not participate in the investigation, these practices do not violate fundamental principles of justice in the context of this case. That context includes the nature of the investigation, involving security interests of Canada, the need for the fairest possible process, consistent with those interests, for the individual involved. In that balancing of interests in this case there was provided to the applicant sufficient information of the concerns of CSIS to be met, with reasonable opportunity to respond by his own evidence, and the evidence of others called on his behalf, to be heard by SIRC.
8) Finally, in relation to s. 2 of the
Charter
, it is my opinion that s. 19(1)(g) does not raise considerations relating to contravention of s. 2(b), the freedom of expression. On the other hand, it is my opinion that s. 19(1)(g), insofar as it relates to "persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe ... are members of ... an organization that is likely to engage in ... acts" "[of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada]", contravenes s. 2(d) of the
Charter
which ensures, to everyone, freedom of association. I find it is not established that this limitation of that freedom under the impugned portion of the paragraph in issue is a reasonable limit demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. I note that this determination does not relate to other classes of persons described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
.
