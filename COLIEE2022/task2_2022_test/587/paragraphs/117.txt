As Mr. Justice Sopinka found in
Chiarelli
, so I find in this case, the applicant had sufficient information to know the substance of the allegations against him and to be able to respond. Fundamental justice in the context of security reviews, does not require disclosure of full details of the intelligence sources or techniques or the bases of conclusions reached. In my opinion failure to provide full disclosure of all of the evidence adduced to SIRC, failure to provide information about telephone or electronic surveillance results, if any were undertaken, and failure to provide an opportunity for counsel for the applicant to obtain security clearance and to attend hearings determined by SIRC to be in camera and ex parte, did not violate principles of fundamental justice in the context of the SIRC hearings in this case.
