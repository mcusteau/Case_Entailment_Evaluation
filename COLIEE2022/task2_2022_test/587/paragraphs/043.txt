[43]
In any event, as I have indicated, in my opinion the record does not provide an evidentiary base for a conclusion that s. 19(1)(g) in its terms or as it was here applied relates to a group of persons in a manner that is discriminatory in its treatment of them compared with its treatment of similarly situated persons, or that it imposed, in a discriminatory fashion, burdens or disadvantages upon the persons affected which are not imposed upon other members of society. CAF's argument that s. 19(1)(g) as applied here treats Palestinian permanent residents differentially on the prohibited ground of national or ethnic origin, by reason of their association with Palestinian organizations or causes, is not supported on the evidence in the record.
