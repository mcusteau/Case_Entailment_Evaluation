In my opinion the duty arising under the principle of fairness does not require a further opportunity for submissions to the Governor-in-Council by the person concerned before action is taken. The case to be answered by the person concerned has already been brought to his attention through the provision of a statement of circumstances at the beginning of the SIRC process, and full opportunity to respond and to make submissions has been provided through that process. The only circumstances where the duty of fairness might clearly require a further opportunity for submissions after delivery of the SIRC report would be where SIRC's report is favourable to the permanent resident and does not recommend the issue of a certificate, but the Governor General-in-Council, not satisfied with that report in light of other material or reports before it, determines, in the exercise of its discretion, that the person concerned is indeed one against whom a certificate should be issued under s.Â 40(1). If that should happen, so that information considered was not before SIRC and thus not part of the circumstances the person concerned has had opportunity to respond to, then fairness demands that before a final decision to issue a certificate is made, the person concerned be apprised of information to be considered and be given an opportunity to respond to that before a final decision. If that were not done, it seems to me that the Governor General-in-Council, ostensibly acting on initiative as an exercise of residual prerogative power, might well be considered to be by-passing the procedure established by Parliament, by legislation, to control the exercise of that power.
