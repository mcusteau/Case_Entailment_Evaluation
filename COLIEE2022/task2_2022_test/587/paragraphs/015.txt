For the record I note that in relation to the application in file IMM-4557-93 counsel for the respondents filed a certificate under the
Canada Evidence Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c.Â C-5, certifying that portions of the record of SIRC proceedings were not disclosed to the applicant or his counsel for reasons of national security. That certificate was not questioned by objection and those portions of the SIRC record to which it refers were not before the court in these proceedings.
