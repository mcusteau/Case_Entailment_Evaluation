The respondents' argument that no adequate evidentiary base is here developed for proper consideration of the issue, an important constitutional issue, is persuasive. Moreover, it would be an exceptional case, if any, in which the court would determine an issue that is not raised in argument by the parties in judicial review but is raised by an intervenor in the proceedings. Counsel for the respondents referred by analogy to the decision of Mr. Justice Mahoney for the Court of Appeal in
International Fund for Animal Welfare Inc., Best and Davies v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans) et al.
, [1988] 3 F.C. 590; 83 N.R. 301 (F.C.A.), rejecting an application by an applicant for standing as an intervenor in an appeal where the applicant sought to raise a constitutional issue not raised at trial, and not anticipated to be raised on appeal, by the parties. While the circumstances here are different, the principle is well established that the parties to an action, or to an application for judicial review, set the issues to be resolved by their pleadings or documents as those are advanced by submissions when the matter is heard. It is primarily the applicant for relief who sets the scope of proceedings in an originating motion for judicial review, ultimately by argument defining the issues, subject only to further issues arising from the response by the respondent, on preliminary, procedural or defense grounds.
