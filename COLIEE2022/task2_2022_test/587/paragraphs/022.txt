Two of the issues, raised early, were not pursued when the applications were heard. The first concerned the affidavit sworn September 15, 1993 by the applicant in support of his first application for leave and for judicial review (IMM-4557-93) and the relevance, for the court on judicial review, of events, referred to in the affidavit, which occurred after the SIRC decision. The events concerned were primarily developments in then evolving Palestinian-Israeli relations. The issue concerning the affidavit was initially raised at the hearing in May 1994, which was adjourned, but when counsel for the applicant made no particular reference to events referred to in the affidavit in later argument at the hearing of both applications, counsel for the respondents was content not to pursue the issue. In the ordinary course, subsequent events, not constituting part of the record or the context of a questioned decision, in this case by SIRC, are not relevant in the court's assessment in judicial review of that decision. Of course, insofar as the events here included in the applicant's affidavit are matters of general public knowledge and in the public domain, counsel was free to direct the court's attention to them for consideration by judicial notice if they were deemed significant for the applicant's case, but this was not done.
