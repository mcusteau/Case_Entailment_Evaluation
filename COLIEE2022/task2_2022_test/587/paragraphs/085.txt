No question is raised in regard to two of the classes of persons included in s. 19(1)(g), that is, "persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe will engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada or ... [who] are likely to participate in the unlawful activities of an organization that is likely to engage in such acts of violence". The argument arises, and is dealt with by all counsel, as relating to the second class of persons within s. 19(1)(g), the class which SIRC found included Mr. Al Yamani, that is "persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe ... are members of ... an organization that is likely to engage" in the described acts of violence.
