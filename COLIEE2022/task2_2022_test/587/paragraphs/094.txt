In my opinion that view does not fairly express the issue here raised. That issue is whether s. 19(1)(g) does restrict freedom of association for a permanent resident. I note, if it needs emphasis, that the freedoms assured by s.Â 2 of the
Charter
are for "everyone", for the permanent resident as for the citizen in Canada. Deprivation of an opportunity under the law for a citizen because of his or her membership in or other association with an organization, not otherwise defined, likely to engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada, in my view, could hardly be said not to restrict the freedom of Canadians to associate as members of organizations. The fact that s. 19(1)(g) does not apply to citizens, but only to foreign nationals whether they have become permanent residents or not, does not render the provision constitutional. In the class of persons which SIRC found to include Mr. Al Yamani, it is membership in an organization generally described that is the basis for his inclusion, and for his probable deportation.
