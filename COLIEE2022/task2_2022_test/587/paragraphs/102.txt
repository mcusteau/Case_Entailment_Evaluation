For the Attorney General, argument was made as though the words in issue in s. 19(1)(g) dealt with members of a "terrorist organization", since in the context of this case the applicant had been found to be a member of a terrorist organization. But the paragraph does not expressly limit its scope to members of a "terrorist organization". Moreover, it would not seem appropriate to include a terrorist organization within s. 19(1)(g) since that would overlap or duplicate s. 19(1)(e) which specifically refers, in part, to "persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe ... are members of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe will ... engage in terrorism".
