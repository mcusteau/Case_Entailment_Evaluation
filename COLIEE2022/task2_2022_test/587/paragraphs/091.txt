I accept that for a permanent resident loss of opportunity to acquire citizenship and likely deportation as a result of a negative finding by SIRC in relation to s. 19(1)(g) constitutes a denial of significant opportunity. It is true that the Court of Appeal in
Hurd v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1989] 2 F.C. 594, at 606; 90 N.R. 31, at 37-38 (F.C.A.), dealing with provisions of the
Act
relating to an order of deportation by an inquiry upon finding convictions for criminal offenses, found that deportation was not punishment within s. 11(h) of the
Charter
; rather it was said to be analogous to a loss of a licence or to dismissal from a police force, or to the forfeiture of a right to practice a profession. That deportation is not punishment, when applicable to permanent residents with a criminal record, was affirmed by Mr. Justice Pratte in the Court of Appeal decision in
Chiarelli v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1990] 2 F.C. 299, at 309; 107 N.R. 107; 10 Imm. L.R.(2d) 137, at 146 (F.C.A.), a view with which Mr. Justice Sopinka agreed when he dealt, on behalf of the Supreme Court, with the appeal in that case: see
Chiarelli v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711, at 735; 135 N.R. 161, at 185; 90 D.L.R.(4th) 289, at 305. For Pratte, J.A., in the Court of Appeal in that case, the provision for a deportation order to be issued under s. 32(2) of the
Act
to a permanent resident who is found to be a member of an inadmissible class, including persons described within s. 19(1)(g), was "the necessary corollary of the limits imposed ... on the right of a permanent resident to come and remain in Canada ... Deportation is the only practical means of forcing a foreigner who is illegally here to leave" (at [1990] 2 F.C. 309). Nevertheless, while deportation may not constitute punishment within s. 12 of the
Charter
, in my view it does constitute a deprivation of significance for a permanent resident.
