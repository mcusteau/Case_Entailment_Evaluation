At the time of the commencement of hearings in regard to IMM-4557-93, in May 1994, an inquiry under the
Act
had been initiated and was scheduled to be continued and concluded before this matter was able to be dealt with at the dates finally set for hearing the two applications, in August. Upon application by the applicant heard in Toronto on May 30, 1994 by appearance of counsel and by telephone the following day from Ottawa with counsel in Toronto, I ordered on May 31, 1994 that no removal or deportation order be issued against the applicant pending determination of these applications for judicial review then before the court. Reasons for order in regard to that order were filed June 20, 1994 [see 80 F.T.R. 307].
