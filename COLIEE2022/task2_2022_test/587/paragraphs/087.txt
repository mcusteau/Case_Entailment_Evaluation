In addition, however, the applicant argues in relation to s. 2(b) of the
Charter
that his varied activities in association with or in support of PFLP causes and purposes were peaceful exercises of free expression in support of a free and democratic Palestine. The applicant relies on the concept of free expression set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Procureur général)
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927; 94 N.R. 167; 24 Q.A.C. 2; 58 D.L.R.(4th) 577; 25 C.P.R.(3d) 417, and the method of assessing in a given case whether assured freedoms are restricted by government action (per Dickson, C.J., Lamer and Wilson, JJ., at pp. 966-979 of [1989] 1 S.C.R.). It is here urged that freedom of expression is restricted by the effect of s. 19(1)(g) as it applies to persons who are members of organizations likely to engage in acts of violence, for the ultimate effect of classification within the paragraph is to exclude, or remove, from Canada persons who are engaged simply in exercise of basic freedoms and who are not themselves likely to participate in acts of violence. I note that the CAF, intervening, supports the applicant in this approach and argument.
