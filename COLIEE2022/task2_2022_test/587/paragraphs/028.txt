The question of the court's jurisdiction was again dealt with in argument between the parties at the later hearing in relation to both applications. In essence, the Attorney General for the respondents, urges that the decision and report of SIRC is not a final decision in the statutory process established for dealing with cases like the applicant's. In this case his right as a permanent resident to remain in Canada is subject to be terminated by a deportation order upon inquiry where he is found to be a person within s. 19(1)(g) and a certificate has been issued under s. 40(1) of the
Act
. It is urged that the SIRC decision and report is only an intermediate step, which in effect results in a recommendation to the Governor-in-Council. It is not disputed that the SIRC decision is one made by a federal tribunal, but since it is not a final decision it is suggested it ought not to be subject to judicial review. Parliament, by the process established under the
Immigration
and
CSIS Acts
has established a process which it intended to be reasonably expeditious in dealing with situations where a permanent resident in Canada is seen to present a security risk to the safety of people in Canada, and it would be inappropriate to entertain judicial review proceedings at every step in a process involving three or more steps. The appropriate place for judicial review in this staged process, the Attorney General suggests, is following the decision of the Governor-in-Council, when complaints about the underlying considerations for that decision, including the decision and report of SIRC, could be subject to review in reviewing the decision of the Governor-in-Council. Moreover, it is urged that, since Parliament provided ultimately for an appeal of any deportation order made after an inquiry, following issue of a certificate under s. 40(1) of the
Act
, it would here be inappropriate for judicial review of any decision of SIRC, which is an early stage in the process that may ultimately lead to a deportation order, which order is then subject to appeal.
