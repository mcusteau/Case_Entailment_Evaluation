[58]
A further submission on behalf of the applicant concerning the findings of fact in SIRC's report relates to its final finding, the most significant one for purposes of s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
, that the PFLP is a terrorist organization that is likely to engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. It is urged that finding is unreasonable in light of the evidence presented to SIRC. The argument is based on the principle enunciated by Mr. Justice Lamer (as he was then) in
Davidson v. Slaight Communications Inc.
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; 98 N.R. 183; 59 D.L.R.(4th) 416; 26 C.C.E.L. 85; 89 C.L.L.C. 14,031; 40 C.R.R. 100, at 1076 S.C.R., that
"Whether it is the interpretation of legislation that is unreasonable or the order made in my view matters no more than the question of whether the error is one of law or of fact. An administrative tribunal exercising discretion can never do so unreasonably."
Referring to his earlier comments in
Blanchard v. Control Data Canada Ltd.
, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 476; 55 N.R. 194; 14 D.L.R. (4th) 289; 89 C.L.L.C. 14,070; 14 Admin. L.R. 133, Lamer, J., noted that an administrative tribunal may make a mistake but it may not be unreasonable in its findings whether of fact or law. An unreasonable finding justifies intervention by a reviewing court.
