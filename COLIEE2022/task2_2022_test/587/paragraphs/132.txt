In
Liyanagamage v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1994), 176 N.R. 4 (F.C.A.), Mr. Justice Décary said, in part (at p. 5):
"In order to be certified pursuant to s. 83(1), a question must be one which, in the opinion of the motions judge, transcends the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation and contemplates issues of broad significance or general application (see the useful analysis of the concept of 'importance' by Catzman, J., in
Rankin v. McLeod, Young, Weir Ltd. et al.
(1986), 57 O.R.(2d) 569 (H.C.)) but it must also be one that is determinative of the appeal. The certification process contemplated by s. 83 of the
Immigration Act
is neither to be equated with the reference process established by s. 18.3 of the
Federal Court Act
, nor is it to be used as a tool to obtain from the Court of Appeal declaratory judgments on fine questions which need not be decided in order to dispose of a particular case."
