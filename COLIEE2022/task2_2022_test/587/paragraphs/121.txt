I do not agree that no policy aspects are involved in the SIRC process though any that are involved may be procedural. SIRC's investigations relate to a variety of circumstances, by no means limited to those arising under the
Immigration Act
. All of its investigations have in common that they involve considerations of national security. Its investigations apparently are reasonably few, yet for the member or members involved, who are all part-time in terms of commitment to SIRC's overall functions, including investigations, it is appropriate that all members be kept abreast of work carried on in the name of the committee, on an ongoing basis. In my view, the process of keeping members informed, with an opportunity to comment on matters other than the substance dealt with in a report, must inform committee members for their complementary responsibilities, particularly in review and comment upon the work of CSIS. In this case I also note there is no reasonable suggestion that the report provided to the applicant was not the report of the presiding member who heard the evidence presented by CSIS officers and on behalf of the applicant.
