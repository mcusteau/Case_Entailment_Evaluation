MacKay, J.
: These are two applications for judicial review in relation to a decision of the Security Intelligence Review Committee ("SIRC"), made August 3, 1994, and a decision of the Governor General-in-Council made August 25, 1994, based upon the decision and report of SIRC. Both decisions relate to the applicant. Respectively, the decisions were: in IMM-4557-93, the SIRC report and conclusion that the applicant is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 as amended (the "
Act
"), and its resulting recommendation that a certificate to that effect be issued under s. 40(1) of the
Act
; and in IMM-2197-94, the decision of the Governor General-in-Council made August 25, 1994 that it was satisfied the applicant is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
and directing the Solicitor General to issue a security certificate under s. 40. Subsequently, on September 28, 1993, the Solicitor General of Canada issued a certificate pursuant to s. 40(1) certifying that the applicant is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
.
