The only evidence referred to by the Attorney General in support of s. 1 is that previously referred to, the briefing note to the Minister of the day at the time the bill introducing s. 19(1)(g) was before the House of Commons. I accept argument based partly on that note, and the words of the paragraph in question that support the conclusion that, as enacted, Parliament did intend the
Act
to embrace persons who are members of the organizations as generally defined within the statute. The provision, in the statutory context of related legislative provisions for excluding or removing noncitizens deemed to present a risk to persons in Canada because of security or criminal activities, I accept as directed to the purpose of Parliament to protect persons in Canada from violent acts. Such a purpose, a basic purpose of the state, may override
Charter
protected freedoms under s. 1 of the
Charter
