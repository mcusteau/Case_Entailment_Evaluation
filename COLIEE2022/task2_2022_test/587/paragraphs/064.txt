In my opinion, the ordinary standard of proof in civil, as opposed to criminal, actions was properly considered as the basis of the findings by SIRC, that is, those findings were based on a balance of probabilities. In my view, that standard is implied in the findings of the SIRC report. I note in passing that the report refers briefly to the question of the burden of proof. First, in reviewing the submissions of the Attorney General, the report notes that "the Service [CSIS] believes that it must demonstrate only that there are reasonable grounds showing that Mr. Yamani is a person described in paragraphs 19(1)(e) or (g) of the
Immigration Act
". Second, in review of Mr. Al Yamani's legal arguments the report notes his submission that the words "reasonable ground to believe" in s. 19(g) "import an objective standard against which the belief must be measured. He submitted that the Attorney General has the burden of proving the evidence on a balance of probabilities". Apparently no suggestion was there made that the burden of proof required should be a high degree of probability, though the report notes that the applicant urged that the test of "reasonable grounds", based on a balance of probabilities, be rigorously applied.
