In relation to the word "member" the applicant's submission is in essence that SIRC erred, in light of the perceived purpose of s. 19(1)(g), in its construction. The word is not defined in the
Act
or in the section. The purpose of the paragraph, it is suggested, is to deal with persons who might engage in violent activities exposing persons in Canada to harm, for the provision assumes that persons will engage in harmful activities by virtue of their membership in certain groups. Rationally, in light of that assumption, the groups in question, it is submitted, are those which have exclusively illegal violent aims and methods, or those with both legal and illegal aims and methods, in which members of the organizations are duty bound to commit illegal acts. Here on the evidence PFLP was in the second category, a multi-purpose group, but there was no evidence that a member was bound to commit illegal acts.
