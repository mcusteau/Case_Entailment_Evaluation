In reviewing the background of these applications I referred to the request by counsel for the applicant, by letter of August 19, 1993, that the Governor General-in-Council not act upon SIRC's report, before determination of the application for leave and for judicial review in relation to SIRC's report and conclusion, or alternatively before opportunity for the applicant to make submissions to the Governor General-in-Council in regard to that report. By the time the letter was dealt with the Governor General-in-Council had already acted under s.Â 40(1) of the
Act
to direct the Solicitor General to issue a certificate.
