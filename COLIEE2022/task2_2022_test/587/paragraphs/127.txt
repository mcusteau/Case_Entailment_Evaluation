[127]
I find that the applicant has not established that conclusions of fact or applications of the law included in the SIRC report were in error in any way that would warrant intervention by the court. The sole ground for setting aside the conclusion of SIRC is that it is based on a portion of s. 19(1)(g) which I find is not constitutional. In completing its investigation in relation to the report under s. 39(2) of the
Act
by the Ministers concerned, made in relation to the applicant, SIRC itself can best determine the appropriate arrangement. In my opinion, the conclusions reached in the report of August 3, 1993 stand, except for the conclusion that the applicant is a person described within the one class of persons described in s. 19(1)(g) which I have found contravenes s. 2(d) of the
Charter
in a manner not saved by s. 1. Whether the investigation by SIRC is to be completed by Mr. Courtois, or is to be undertaken anew by another designated member, is a matter for SIRC to arrange.
