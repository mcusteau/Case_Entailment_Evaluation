The fact that ultimately an appeal may be raised in regard to any deportation order that may issue in future, is not in this case a serious consideration in determining whether the court should exercise its discretion to grant relief in an application for judicial review of SIRC's decision. The ultimate appeal, to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, would relate to the deportation order issued, where the basis of that order is a certificate under s. 40(1) of the
Act
. Since issue of that certificate appears to be a matter within discretion of the Governor General-in-Council under s. 40(1) it may be difficult to seriously question the SIRC decision as the basis of the certificate. In my opinion, SIRC's decision can be dealt with more directly by consideration of an application for judicial review of that decision itself, if leave be granted for hearing that application, as in the proceedings in IMM-4557-93.
