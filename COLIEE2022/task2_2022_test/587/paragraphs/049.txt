A factor linked by SIRC to its decision concerning the question of credibility on membership was the applicant's resort to counter-surveillance tactics and code words, demonstrating "a lack of transparency essential to convey a sense of truthfulness". Here again it is urged that SIRC ignored relevant evidence, including the applicant's upbringing in the family of a founder of the PFLP in circumstances where vigilance was essential for survival, his acknowledged concern about surveillance activities possible by Israeli Mossad agents or inspired by them through Canadian agencies, the evidence of others called as witnesses who testified as to the reality of concern about security measures by Palestinians generally. Further, the tribunal ignored the fact that CSIS appeared to have maintained wire tap or electronic surveillance and monitoring of mail of the applicant for some time in this case, so that his concerns about surveillance were not misplaced.
