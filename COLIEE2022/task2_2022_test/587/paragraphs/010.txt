I complete a summary description of the process, established by statute, of which the action by SIRC and of the Governor-in-Council form a part. Under the
Act
, the Ministers concerned may file a report with an immigration officer or an adjudicator concerning their opinion that a person is a person described within s. 19(1)(g). When charged with conduct of an inquiry on information that a person is within the description of persons described within s. 19(1)(g), if the person is a permanent resident and a certificate has been issued against him or her pursuant to s. 40(1) of the
Act
, an adjudicator shall issue a deportation order (ss. 32(2) and 27(1) of the
Act
). Finally, provision is made, under s. 70(4) for an appeal to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, in relation to a deportation order, on a question of law, or fact, or of mixed law and fact.
