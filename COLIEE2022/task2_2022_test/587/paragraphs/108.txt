I note that in addition to the particular procedures which the applicant contends violate s. 7 of the
Charter
, the intervenor CCLA urges that s. 19(1)(g) violates s. 7 in that it deprives the permanent resident of liberty, freedom, not on the basis of a record of violence by the individual but on the ground that some organization he or she belongs to, perhaps a union they join in Canada, may be likely to commit acts of violence as described, i.e., on the prospect or prediction of future behaviour of an organization of which the permanent resident is a member, whether or not the individual has any tendency to violence and without regard to the individual's capacity to influence conduct of the organization or other members.
