In the course of the hearings four officers of CSIS testified in camera without the applicant or his counsel present. A summary record of evidence, reportedly provided by two of those witnesses, and expurgated versions of the in camera testimony of two of the CSIS officers, were provided to the applicant. Counsel for the applicant was present with the applicant in hearings to examine those officers in regard to matters included within the expurgated record of their testimony made available by SIRC to the applicant. No summary or other record of testimony of two other CSIS officers was provided to the applicant. Mr. Al Yamani testified at the hearing and a number of witnesses also testified on his behalf, including persons with expertise in regard to Middle Eastern Affairs. One other expert in similar matters was called by SIRC. All of those witnesses testified in the presence of the applicant and were examined by his counsel.
