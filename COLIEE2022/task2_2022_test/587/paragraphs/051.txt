In regard to its findings that the PFLP is a terrorist organization, and that it is likely to engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada, it is urged that the tribunal ignored evidence and adopted a simplistic approach without appropriate understanding of Middle East organizations or of the PFLP itself. It relied on certain public statements of the organization's leader, George Habash, in the years 1990 and 1993, supporting violence, a position he had not renounced. It relied also upon the views of a CSIS officer, the Director of Counter Terrorism, who, it is said for the applicant, acknowledged limited knowledge of the PFLP while claiming expertise relating to international terrorism generally. SIRC is said to have ignored the views of scholar-witnesses, specialists on Middle East and Palestinian affairs, that the PFLP had not engaged in terrorist activities since 1972 and that it and its leaders had moved to publicly acknowledge two states, for the people of Israel and Palestine respectively; in summary, that the PFLP was no longer a terrorist organization and that it had no record of, and would not be expected to commit acts of violence in Canada or North America.
