The first is that SIRC did not disclose to the applicant all evidence adduced before the committee. Testimony was heard from two witnesses in the absence of the accused and his counsel, and no summary of their evidence or other disclosure of the nature of their testimony was provided. In addition, for the applicant it is said that evidence adduced from CSIS officers and questions asked of Mr. Al Yamani himself, indicate that telephone or electronic surveillance had been undertaken of him, and no transcript, tape or other record of the conversations monitored was provided.

, while SIRC had heard testimony ex parte, and in camera, a summary of the substance of all that evidence was provided, and in addition a "Summary of Interpretation of Intercepted Private Communications" was also provided. Cross-examination of CSIS officers made available in the case at bar, indicates that information about intercepted communications may sometimes be made available through SIRC hearings, if they are admitted to have been undertaken, and if the information is available and can be revealed without adverse effect upon others or upon CSIS sources, methods or other processes. Here no evidence of intercepted communications was provided. Failure to provide full disclosure of all evidence before SIRC is said to have prejudiced the applicant, hampering his ability to understand the concerns of CSIS officers and to provide explanation in relation to those concerns.
