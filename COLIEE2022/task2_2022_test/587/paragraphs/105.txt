In my opinion, s. 19(1)(g), insofar as it relates to persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe are members of an organization that is likely to commit acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada, restricts freedom of association and that restriction is not a limitation demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society. Thus it contravenes s. 2(d) of the
Charter
and is of no force or effect pursuant to s. 52 of the
Constitution Act, 1982
.
