R. v. Oakes
, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103; 65 N.R. 87; 14 O.A.C. 335; 26 D.L.R.(4th) 200; 50 C.R.(3d) 1; 24 C.C.C.(3d) 321; 19 C.R.R. 308, teaches that where s.Â 1 is in issue the party seeking to uphold the impugned provision has the onus of establishing on a balance of probabilities that, among alternative measures for implementing the purpose, the measure selected by Parliament meets a demand that is pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society, that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified by a proportionality test. The measure must be carefully designed to meet the objective in question - not arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations, but rationally connected to the objective. It must impair as little as possible the freedom in question. Further, there must be a proportionality between the effects of the measure adopted and the objective identified.
