For the Attorney General on behalf of the respondents it is submitted that the applicant does not establish the standard necessary under s.Â 18.1(4)(d) of the
Federal Court Act
for this court to intervene on judicial review in relation to findings of fact of SIRC. In sum the findings challenged are not perverse or capricious or without support in the evidence before the tribunal. Moreover, it is urged that the court owes considerable deference to findings of fact by a specialist tribunal, as SIRC is, in regard to matters of concern in relation to security.
