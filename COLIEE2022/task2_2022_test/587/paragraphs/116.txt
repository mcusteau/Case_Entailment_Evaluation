In my opinion, when one considers the arrangements made in relation to the hearings by SIRC in this case, in light of the context in which the hearings are conducted, and the nature of the issues dealt with, there was no breach of principles of fundamental justice relating to the fairness of the hearing before the committee. A statement of circumstances was provided to the applicant before the hearings commenced. That statement summarized the information on which the joint decision of the Ministers had been made to initiate the process under s. 39(2) of the
Act
. In short, the applicant was advised of the case he had to meet. It is true that certain information was provided to SIRC in camera and ex parte and the nature of some of that was not provided by summary or expurgated transcript to the applicant, but I note again that some of the information provided to SIRC in camera and ex parte was provided to the applicant by way of summary and by expurgated transcripts. In
Chiarelli
, supra, Mr. Justice Sopinka reaffirmed that the scope of the principles of fundamental justice will vary with the context and the interests at stake and
"... the rules of natural justice and the concept of procedural fairness, which may inform principles of fundamental justice in a particular context, are not fixed standards." (at [1992] 1 S.C.R. 743-744)
He further commented at pp. 744-745:
"In the context of hearings conducted by the Review Committee pursuant to a joint report, an individual has an interest in a fair procedure since the Committee's investigation may result in its recommending to the Governor-in-Council that a s. 83 certificate issue, removing an appeal on compassionate grounds. However, the state also has a considerable interest in effectively conducting national security and criminal intelligence investigations and in protecting police sources. The need for confidentiality in national security cases was emphasized by Lord Denning in
Secretary of State for the Home Department
, ex parte Hosenball
, [1977] 3 All E.R. 452 (C.A.), at p. 460:
'The information supplied to the Home Secretary by the Security Service is, and must be, highly confidential. The public interest in the security of the realm is so great that the sources of information must not be disclosed, nor should the nature of the information itself be disclosed, if there is any risk that it would lead to the sources being discovered. The reason is because, in this very secretive field, our enemies might try to eliminate the source of information.'

"The
CSIS Act
and Review Committee Rules recognize the competing individual and state interests and attempt to find a reasonable balance between them. The rules expressly direct that the Committee's discretion be exercised with regard to this balancing of interests."
