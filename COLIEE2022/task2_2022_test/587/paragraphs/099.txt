[99]
In this case the Attorney General for the respondents urges that the requirements of s. 1 of the
Charter
are met. The
Act
includes s. 39 and s. 40, under which action was taken in this case, within a group of sections headed "Safety and Security of Canada". They are preceded by s. 38.1 which identifies purposes of the sections here followed. The purposes of Parliament affirmed in s. 38.1 include the removal from Canada of persons who constitute a threat to the security or interests of Canada or whose presence endangers the lives or safety of persons in Canada. That provision, s. 38.1, enacted in 1992, became effective February 1, 1993, after the SIRC committee had commenced its investigation of the Ministers' report concerning the applicant. Nevertheless, the purposes identified by Parliament were evident in the statute before 1993, although their international dimensions may be more apparent from the section now in force. Section 19(1)(g) is incorporated by reference in ss. 39 and 40, and as noted earlier I accept its general purpose is the protection and safety of persons living in Canada, by identifying persons who present a threat to their safety.
