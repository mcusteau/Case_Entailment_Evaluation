Thereafter, on August 19, 1993 counsel for the applicant wrote to the Solicitor General requesting that the case not be considered by the Governor General-in-Council until this court had opportunity to consider the application for judicial review filed on August 18 concerning the SIRC report.

Counsel for the Solicitor General responded on September 3, 1993 that it would not be appropriate for the Minister to intervene, and in any event it was too late to intervene, even if it were appropriate, for the Governor General-in-Council had already made its decision, based on the report, on August 25, 1993.
