SIRC reached three conclusions that are key to its finding that the applicant was a person within s.Â 19(1)(g); that he was a member of the PFLP and was not truthful in his testimony that he was not; that the PFLP is a terrorist organization; and that the PFLP is likely (susceptible) to engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. In relation to the statutory provision in question only the first and third of these conclusions were essential, as the first paragraph in the conclusion of the report recognizes, stating:
"In light of the evidence showing that he is a member of the PFLP, which organization could engage in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada, I therefore come to the conclusion that Mr. Yamani is a person described in s. 19(1)(g) of the
Immigration Act
."
