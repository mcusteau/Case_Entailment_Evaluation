The argument of the applicant that fairness requires that reasons be given upon decision by the Governor General-in-Council is not persuasive. In this case where the decision is specifically said to be based on the grounds set out in the SIRC report, and there is no evidence otherwise, the reasons for the determination of the Governor General-in-Council are essentially those of SIRC in reaching its conclusion, and the conclusion of the Governor General-in-Council that it is satisfied that the applicant is a person included among those described by s. 19(1)(g), for whom a certificate under s.Â 40(1) is to be issued.
