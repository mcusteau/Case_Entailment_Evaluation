I accept the submissions of the applicant that the ordinary meaning of the English word "likely" is "probable" or "more probable than not". I accept as well the submissions of the Attorney General for the respondents that the French text of s. 19(1)(g), which cannot be ignored in interpretation of the provision, includes the phrase "ou qu'elles appartiennent à une organisation
susceptible
de commettre de tels actes ou qu'elles sont
susceptibles
de prendre part aux activités illégales d'une telle organisation" (italic added) for the English "or are members of or are likely to participate in the unlawful activities of an organization that is likely to engage in such acts of violence". The French text uses "susceptible" for "likely" and it is noteworthy that the report of SIRC in its conclusion about the PFLP states that it is found to be "a terrorist organization likely ('susceptible') to engage in acts of violence.". In
Le Petit Robert 1, Dictionnaire de la Langue Française
(Montreal. Paris. 1987) "susceptible" is defined as "capable" or "sujet à". In
Harrap's Standard French and English Dictionary
(London, 8th Impression, 1987), "susceptible" is translated as "capable of, admitting of, liable to", and in some phrases as "likely to".
