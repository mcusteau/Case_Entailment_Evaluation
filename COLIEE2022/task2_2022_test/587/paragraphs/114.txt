The second aspect of SIRC process, which it is urged violated the principles of fundamental justice concerned SIRC's failure, upon request of counsel for the applicant, to provide security clearance so that counsel, without the applicant, might attend sessions where evidence was provided by CSIS officers to SIRC in camera and ex parte. Submissions were made by counsel for SIRC that there was no provision for this in the statute or the rules of the committee, that it was not required by any principles of fundamental justice. Moreover, if it were to be done, counsel would be in a position of potential conflict with the interests of the client and with his or her professional responsibilities to his client. I agree with the applicant's submission that the last consideration may be a matter that he is free to waive.
