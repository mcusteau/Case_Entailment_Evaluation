In argument the Attorney General points to the whole of the evidence before SIRC. That evidence on the public record (that is, the record available to the applicant and to this court) includes the "allegations" of the Ministers, based on CSIS information, which were included in the Statement of Circumstances provided to the applicant in advance of the hearing. These allegations were supported by evidence provided to SIRC in camera and ex parte, some of which was subsequently summarized or covered by expurgated transcripts of the witnesses who were subsequently available for cross-examination, even if that examination was limited in the nature of questions that were answered, in view of CSIS and SIRC statutory responsibilities to preserve as secret the sources and methods of collection of information provided to the applicant.
