This court has no jurisdiction to entertain a dispute which is solely a matter of contract. However, it will entertain an action which involves a contractual dispute, if the action
primarily
concerns a patent, trademark or copyright (
Titan Linkabit Corp. et al. v. S.E.E. See Electronic Engineering Inc. et al.
(1992), 58 F.T.R. 1; 44 C.P.R.(3d) 469 (T.D.), at p. 472). In this case, the pleadings disclose that the principal issue is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled, in Canada, to a reassignment of the patent. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff was offered an option to reacquire the patent but that the plaintiff refused to pay the agreed price and that the option has lapsed. The central issue would seem to be the nature of the option agreement and whether or not the parties have complied with its terms.
