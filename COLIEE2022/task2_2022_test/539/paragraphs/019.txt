The visa officer explained that she did not award the Applicant 30 units of assessment under subsection 8(4) of the
Immigration Regulations
because the Applicant did not meet the definition of self-employed person in subsection 2(1) of the
Immigration Regulations
. Although this statement appears to collapse two stages of the analysis into one, I am satisfied that the visa officer did not commit a reviewable error. Lutfy, J., recognized in
Pourkazemi
, supra that there is no substantive difference between the requirements of subsection 8(4) of the
Immigration Regulations
, that the Applicant is able to become successfully established in her occupation or business, and the first portion of the definition of self-employed person, that the Applicant has the intention and ability to establish or purchase a business.
