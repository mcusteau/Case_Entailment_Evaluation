An application to be admitted to Canada as an immigrant involves a discretionary decision on the part of the visa officer, who is required to make that decision on the basis of specified statutory criteria. The standard of review to be applied to a visa officer's decision with respect to a finding of fact is patent unreasonableness (
Tanveer v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.T.R. Uned. 67; F.C.J. No. 177;
Tang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] F.C.J. No. 7; 161 F.T.R. 134 (T.D.);
Bhatti v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 880; [1999] F.C.J. No. 1889 (T.D.)). As a result, for this Court to intervene in the visa officer's decision, there must be "either an error of law apparent on the face of the record, or a breach of the duty of fairness appropriate to this essentially administrative assessment" (
