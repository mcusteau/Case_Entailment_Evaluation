As indicated by the above excerpt from the CAIPS notes, the visa officer considered the Applicant's lack of prior business experience, her inability to provide specific evidence or documentation that she had the intention and ability to establish a business in Canada, her failure to conduct any market research into the Canadian market and her generally worded and vague business proposal. The Applicant did not submit any financial statements with her business proposal. Although the Applicant stated at the interview that she would forward a more complete business proposal to the visa officer, she did not do so.
