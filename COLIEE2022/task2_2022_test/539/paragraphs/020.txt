In addition, the CAIPS notes indicate that the visa officer was not satisfied that the Applicant could establish herself as a model in Canada. The Applicant had not contacted any Canadian agencies, unions or associations in the modelling field. The visa officer also had concerns regarding the relevance of the Applicant's employment as a marketing manager for a real estate company to her application for permanent residence. Based on this, and the varying explanations given by the Applicant for her prior visits to Canada, the visa officer was not satisfied that the Applicant was being truthful. Although the visa officer indicated these concerns to the Applicant, she did not provide sufficient evidence to relieve the visa officer of those concerns. As a result, there was evidence before the visa officer to support the conclusion that the Applicant would not become successfully established in her occupation in Canada. Even if the visa officer erred by not explicitly stating this conclusion in her refusal letter, that error would be immaterial because the Applicant did not meet the definition of a self-employed person.
