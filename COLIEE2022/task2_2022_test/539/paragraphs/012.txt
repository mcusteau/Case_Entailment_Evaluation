In
Momcilovic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2001 FCT 998, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1375, Muldoon, J., stated at paragraph 6 that the "practice when dealing with affiants who cannot read the language in which an affidavit is written, as reflected by Rule 80 of the
Federal Court Rules
, is to include an affidavit from the interpreter attesting that the affidavit was translated." In
Momcilovic
, supra, Muldoon, J., gave no weight to the affidavit of an the applicant who could not read English because that affidavit was not accompanied by an interpreter's affidavit and, as a result, there was no indication that the applicant understood what she was signing when she swore her affidavit.
