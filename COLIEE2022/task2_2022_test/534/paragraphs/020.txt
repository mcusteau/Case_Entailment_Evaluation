The jurisprudence of this Court indicates that the Court has remitted applications back to tribunals with specific directions that, in effect, direct a specific decision. However, the jurisprudence is also clear that this remedy should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. Madam Justice Reed in
Ali v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1994] 3 F.C. 73; 76 F.T.R. 182 (T.D.), at paragraphs 17 and 18 found the following considerations to be relevant to the consideration of whether specific directions respecting a decision should be issued:
路 is the evidence on the record so clearly conclusive that there is only one possible conclusion;
路 is the sole issue to be decided a pure question of law which will be dispositive of the case;
路 is the question of law based on uncontroverted evidence and accepted facts; and
路 is there a factual issue which involves conflicting evidence which is central to the claim?
