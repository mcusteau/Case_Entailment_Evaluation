[15]
In the present case, counsel for the Minister conceded a number of errors in the decision below, including:
· Mr. Johnson never told the panel that he had been diagnosed by a nurse. The panel therefore misapprehended his evidence and erred when it stated in its reasons that Mr. Johnson had so testified and then concluded that such testimony contradicted the doctor's note Mr. Johnson had provided.
· The panel erred by importing its knowledge of the geography of Brampton and the location of its hospital into the hearing, without first dealing properly, or at all, with Mr. Johnson's explanation that to him, the words "clinic" and "hospital" are interchangeable.
· The panel misstated the facts when it told Mr. Johnson that at the August 10, 2004 hearing his counsel "sat in this room and he had no idea what happened to you" when in fact Mr. Johnson's counsel had known of Mr. Johnson's circumstance and had informed the panel on August 10 that Mr. Johnson could not attend due to a back injury.
· The panel inappropriately failed to allow Mr. Johnson to answer something other than "yes" or "no" when asked if he was prepared to proceed with his claim, and refused to let Mr. Johnson explain why he was not comfortable proceeding without his lawyer.
· The panel erred by advising Mr. Johnson that on August 10, 2004 it had been insufficient for him to have explained his situation to his lawyer because he was required to have dealt directly with the Immigration and Refugee Board.
