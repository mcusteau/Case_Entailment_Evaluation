To this I would add that the panel erred in drawing an adverse inference from the fact that Mr. Johnson's counsel had not mentioned to the panel any difficulty he might have in attending the abandonment hearing scheduled for September 10, 2004. Given that the reason his counsel was unable to attend was an emergency visit to the hospital the night before, it was perverse for the panel to indicate that counsel should have made the panel aware of his absence before September 10.
