Mr. Johnson immediately contacted his counsel's office by telephone and spoke to an assistant there. The assistant informed Mr. Johnson that his counsel was unavailable and would not be returning to the office before going to the refugee hearing, but advised Mr. Johnson to forward the doctor's note to his counsel's office for onward transmission to the RPD. The doctor's note was sent to the counsel's office sometime after 12:00 noon on August 10, 2004, and was then forwarded to the RPD by fax between 12:23 and 12:26 p.m. Prior to the start of the hearing Mr. Johnson's counsel was notified of Mr. Johnson's predicament.
