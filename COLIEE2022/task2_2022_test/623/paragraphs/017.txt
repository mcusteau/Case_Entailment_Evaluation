Even though this error in law by the board is sufficient to warrant the intervention of this Court, it is also my view that it was patently unreasonable for the board not to award additional compensation to the applicant on the ground that the delays resulting from the exercising of his rights before this Court could not be construed as administrative delays under subsection 39(2). In fact, the applicant submitted the application for his cardiac problems and his gastro-esophageal reflux on April 16, 1997. It was not until September 20, 2001, that the board finally decided to award him compensation for these problems and only after the matter was brought before the Federal Court. In my view, the fact that the board could not have awarded this benefit earlier is the result of administrative obstacles arising from the necessity to wait for the result of the proceeding in this Court concerning an earlier decision by the same board. In view of the obligation imposed on the board by section 3 of the VRAB Act and by section 2 of the Pension Act to liberally construe and interpret their provisions, I believe that it should have found that this amounted to "administrative difficulties beyond the control of the applicant".
