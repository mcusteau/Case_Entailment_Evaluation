On June 5, 2003, the board denied the applicant's application for reconsideration because the applicant had claimed additional retroactive pension and because the delays incurred when an applicant is exercising his rights before the Federal Court do not qualify as delays for the purposes of subsection 39(2) of the Act. The board explains its position as follows in its decision:
[Translation]
Counsel, on behalf of the appellant, alleges that the board erred in its interpretation in failing to make it retroactive pursuant to subsection 39(2) of the Pension Act.
The board finds that this application is not founded and for a second time the board states that there is no error in law because there was no claim for an additional retroactive pension pursuant to section 39(2) of the Pension Act. In fact, the board could not have erred on this matter if it was never the subject of a decision.
Secondly, the board is of the opinion that the appellant who exercises his rights before the Federal Court and the delays that result therefrom are not sufficient grounds to grant additional retroactive compensation and are not administrative delays within the meaning of subsection 39(2).
