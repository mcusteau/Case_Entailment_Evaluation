Here, the board wrongly made the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it by the provision in question dependant upon a specific request for additional compensation by the pensioner. There is nothing in subsection 39(2) that restricts the discretionary powers given to the board in such a way. The only requirement for the exercise of the discretion conferred by the provision is that the board be of the opinion "that the pension should be awarded from a day earlier than the day prescribed . . . by reason of delays in securing service or other records or other administrative difficulties beyond the control of the applicant." Thus, whether or not a request for additional compensation pursuant to subsection 39(2) is made, the board may, if the record before it indicates that there were such delays or other administrative difficulties and if it is of the opinion that the pension should be awarded from an earlier date because of these delays or administrative difficulties, award additional compensation to the pensioner where the amount does not exceed two years of pension. In my view, this interpretation of subsection 39(2) is supported by the duty imposed upon the board by section 3 of the VRAB Act to interpret the provisions of the Act liberally "to the end that the recognized obligation of the people and Government of Canada to those who have served their country so well and to their dependants may be fulfilled". Further, section 2 of the Pension Act requires that the provisions of that Act be liberally construed and interpreted.
