I believe that the board incorrectly applied subsection 39(2) of the Act, which is an error of law that warrants the intervention of this Court. In fact, as this case is concerned with an issue of statutory interpretation, the applicable standard of judicial review is that of correctness, as the Federal Court of Appeal held in Canada (Attorney General) v. MacDonald (January 23, 2003), A-542-01, 2003 FCA 31, at paragraph 11:
[11] The Applications Judge did not expressly address the standard of review to be applied to the Board's decision, but seems to have applied the correctness standard. Since the disputed question involves the interpretation of the statute, I agree that in this case correctness is the applicable standard.. . . .
