With respect to the Applicant's ability to perform the work of a construction helper based on English language ability, the only reference to English language skills before the Officer was the Applicant's own affidavit in which he attested that his intended employer informed him that knowledge of the English language is not necessary to the job, and that the Applicant can perform the job without English language skills. There was no evidence before the Officer addressing the Applicant's level of English language abilities; thus it was not reasonable to conclude, based on his English language ability, that he could not perform the work of a construction helper.
