In coming to this conclusion, the Privy Council stated that Mr. Justice Ritchie's decision in The "Ioannis Daskelelis" was based on a faulty analysis of The "Colorado" (supra). Their Lordships stated that The "Colorado" was not a case dealing with maritime liens at all. In their view, the reference with respect to French law was made only to determine whether or not the "hypothèque" in question could be considered to have been of the same rank as an English mortgage, and not to determine whether it was entitled to the same treatment as a maritime lien. This contention is made despite the fact that Scrutton, L.J., quite clearly conducts an analysis of the "hypothèque" in terms of the language of maritime liens, and not as if the object of the exercise was to determine whether or not the "hypothèque" is analogous to an English mortgage.
