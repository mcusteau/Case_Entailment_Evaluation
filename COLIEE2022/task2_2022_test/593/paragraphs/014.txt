N.A.T. asserts before this court that it is owed four separate and distinct claims:
- outstanding remittance of deductions made by the owners from the seamen's wages and as well as their proportionate contributions (some of which are more than five years overdue);
- interest on these sums calculated in accordance with the formula referred to above;
- more than one months wages advanced to the crew of the "Galaxias" after the arrest of the ship;
- the monies expended by N.A.T. to effect the repatriation of the crew who were stranded in Vancouver.
