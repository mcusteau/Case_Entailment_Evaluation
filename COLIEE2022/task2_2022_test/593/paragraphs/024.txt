It would appear therefore that these three cases have established that in Canada, when the lex loci of the ship (either the country of registration or the proper law applicable to the contract in question) creates a maritime lien in favour of a party, the latter is entitled to claim the benefits of a maritime lien under the lex fori. This is then subject to the law for the ranking of such claims or liens in the lex fori. The cases supporting this proposition are Todd Shipyards Corporation v. Altema Compania Maritima and The "Ioannis Daskelelis", [1974] S.C.R. 1248 (The "Ioannis Daskelelis"), Ship "Strandhill" v. Walter W. Hodder Company, [1926] S.C.R. 680 (The "Strandhill"), Ship "Har Rai" v. Marlex Petroleum Inc. v. The Shipping Corporation of India Ltd., [1984] 2 F.C. 345; 53 N.R. 1 (F.C.A.), affd. [1987] 1 S.C.R. 57; 72 N.R. 75 (The "Har Rai").
