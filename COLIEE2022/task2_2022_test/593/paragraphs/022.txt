This area of the law has been considered on two occasions by the Supreme Court of Canada, and in a further instance by the Federal Court of Appeal, which decision was affirmed without reasons by the Supreme Court. All three cases dealt with claims asserted by American necessariesmen. In the United States, the claim of the necessariesmen is granted the protection of a maritime lien by operation of statute. Under Canadian maritime law the claim of the necessariesmen is given a right in rem only.
