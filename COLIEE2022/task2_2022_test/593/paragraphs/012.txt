The amounts owing to N.A.T. by both seamen and shipowners are calculated based on a percentage of the seamen's wages, which percentage is determined from time to time by statute. Any shipowner who is in default of his obligations to N.A.T. is further assessed every six months for an additional charge of interest, which is also dictated by statute. For every year that the shipowner is in default, the amount of interest on the overdue sum increases, to reach a maximum of 75% of the original amount owing.
