From the same judgment, it is evident that s. 22 of the Federal Court Act is sufficient to satisfy the purely statutory requirements of the tripartite test. With respect to the second requirement, Mr. Justice McIntyre continued at page 769 S.C.R. of ITO:
"To decide if the second requirement is met, it must be determined whether Canadian maritime law or any other law of Canada relating to any matter coming within the class or subject of navigation and shipping is essential to the disposition of the case and nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction. On this point, no 'other law of Canada' was referred to as being essential to the disposition of the case or as nourishing the statutory claim of jurisdiction of the Federal Court.
"Canadian maritime law, as defined in s. 2 of the Federal Court Act, can be separated into two categories. It is the law that:
(1) was administered by the Exchequer Court of Canada on its admiralty side by virtue of the Admiralty Act or any other statute; or
(2) would have been so administered if that court had had on its admiralty side unlimited jurisdiction in relation to maritime and admiralty matters."
