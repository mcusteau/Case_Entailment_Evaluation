Although I am still of the opinion that N.A.T. is not in contempt of court, I feel very strongly that this court will not stand idly by in the face of what is tantamount to blackmail by them. N.A.T. has asked this court to adjudicate on the merits of its claim, and yet holds in reserve a powerful weapon over the purchaser of the "Galaxias", presumably to cover the eventuality that the court would not recognize the claims it asserts. Even though this behaviour does not technically amount to contempt of court, it does prompt me to make the following orders with respect to costs and interest.
