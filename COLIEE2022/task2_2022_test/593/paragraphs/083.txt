[83]
Pursuant to an order of this court, dated November 10, 1987, any party desirous of leading opinion evidence with respect to foreign law was to do so by December 9, 1987 and all particulars of claims were to be submitted by November 23, 1987. I therefore intend to determine the rights of the claimants Legge and Czech by the material filed by them or on their behalf thus far.
