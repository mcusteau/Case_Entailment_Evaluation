[104]
Although I am not disposed to exercise my equitable jurisdiction in favour of any party to this action by disturbing the ranking of their respective claims, for the reasons given, I do intend to make certain orders with respect to costs and interest which will reflect my displeasure with the conduct of N.A.T. in this and related actions.
