On January 6, 1988, I rendered an oral judgment in court action T-2297-87 which was followed by a written judgment on February 10, 1988. At that time, costs were awarded to the plaintiff Krochenski with respect to the main action and the counterclaim against the defendant Global Cruises S.A. After serious consideration and much reflection, I am satisfied that the costs which were to have been paid by Global Cruises S.A. were the direct result of the failure of N.A.T. to arrange for the issuance of the necessary Certificate through the Minister of Merchant Marine, or at least to alert the court in a frank and timely fashion of the problems it was encountering. If these costs have already been taxed and paid, I order that they be reimbursed to Global by N.A.T., if they have not already been paid, they shall be paid to the plaintiff Krochenski by N.A.T. directly, following taxation. The costs incurred by Global were also as a direct result of the actions and conduct of N.A.T. through its Minister and I intend to order that Global's costs in action T-2297-87 be taxed and paid by N.A.T.
