Baseline Industries Ltd. (Baseline) a Vancouver wharfinger, has advanced a claim for in excess of $450,000.00 for services rendered to the ship before March 24, 1987 including berthage and repairs as outlined in the Birmingham affidavit dated November 23, 1987. Baseline further alleges that as it was in possession of the ship at the time of assumption of her control by the Marshall of the Federal Court, that it is entitled to priority in ranking second only to maritime liens as it had a possessory lien over the "Galaxias". Counsel for Baseline has acknowledged that the possessory lien extends only to the sum of $5,652.67 which was monies expended on repairs and improvements to the "Galaxias". The balance of the claim is with respect to necessaries provided to the ship, the subject of a claim in rem. The leading authority cited by Baseline with respect to possessory liens for repairmen is the case of Montreal Dry Docks et al. v. Halifax Shipyards Limited (1920), 69 S.C.R. 359. In keeping with that case, I am satisfied that Baseline's claim for repairs has the attributes of a possessory lien and will be treated as such. The balance of his client's claim will be ranked as a statutory claim in rem.
