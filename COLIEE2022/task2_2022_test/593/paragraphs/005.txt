After one false start, (the "Galaxias" was offered for sale and no appropriate tender was received), the Deputy Marshall of the Federal Court, S.R. Krochenski, arranged for the re-advertisement of the "Galaxias" in several international newspapers pursuant to the order of Madam Justice Reed dated April 27, 1987 (this order, as subsequently amended, is referred to as the Order for Sale). As a result of the advertisement, an offer of $1.1 million was received from Global Cruises S.A. "Global", and this offer, the highest tender, was accepted. A Bill of Sale was drawn up pursuant to the Order for Sale, which had included the following terms:
"5. The M.V. 'Galaxias' shall be sold, where is, as is, with all faults as they now lie, without any allowance for deficiency in length, weight, quantity or quality or any defect or error whatsoever, particulars not guaranteed,
free and clear of all encumbrances
.
"6. The Deputy Marshall of the Federal Court of Canada shall be vested with the right to execute a Bill of Sale, transferring the vessel to the successful purchaser of the vessel,
free and clear of all encumbrances
.
"7. The proceeds of the sale of the vessel shall be paid into this Court to the credit of all actions in rem, against the vessel, of creditors who have filed Affidavits of Claim in the Registry of this Honourable Court on or before April 23, 1987." (my emphasis)
