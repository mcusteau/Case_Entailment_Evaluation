[105]
N.A.T. clearly attorned to the jurisdiction of this court and has been given every opportunity to argue its claims before me. It has met with a considerable degree of success and will receive almost total satisfaction for the full amount of its substantial claim. Despite the ultimate vindication of its position in law, I am not satisfied that N.A.T.'s behaviour as a party warrants the equitable consideration of the court in either an award of costs, or an award of interest on its claim.
