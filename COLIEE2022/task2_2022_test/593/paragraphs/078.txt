[78]
Two individuals, a Mr. Czech and Mr. Legge duly filed a statement of claim and supporting affidavits claiming the benefit of a maritime lien as providers of necessaries to the "Galaxias" on its voyage from Piraeus, Greece, to Vancouver, British Columbia. The parties did not appear, nor were they represented at the January 4, 1988 hearing although it would seem, that Mr. Czech, in any event, was informed of the hearing date well in advance and in fact submitted a letter to the Registry with a request that it be put before the court pursuant to rule 324.
