Bearing in mind that after June, 1986, the "Galaxias" was no longer in Greek waters, it becomes necessary to determine whether the validity of the N.A.T. lien continued to be subject to the laws of Greece even with respect to claims to contributions which arose long after the "Galaxias" set sail. The maritime lien attaches to the res when the obligation which it secures is incurred. The lex loci of the contracts with respect to the "Galaxias", the crew and the Greek owners of the ship was undoubtedly Greece. It is therefore my view that Greek law applies to N.A.T.'s claim, even to those portions of the claim which arose in Vancouver Harbour.
