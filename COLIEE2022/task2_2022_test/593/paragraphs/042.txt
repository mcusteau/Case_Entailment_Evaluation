Their Lordships' reservations are commendable in view of the desirability of a uniform approach to international maritime law. The mobility of the ships is such that those engaged in maritime trade ought to be able to do so with the knowledge that they will enjoy uniform rights and obligations wherever their voyage takes them. Until this ideal state is reached however, I would have preferred a more "chauvinistic" result, or at least a sense that Canadian courts are able to safeguard the interests of Canadians who provide services to foreign ships and have no way of ascertaining whether or not the ships are subject to a broad range of charges of which they could have no knowledge.
