It is a basic tenet of conflict of laws that foreign law which is proven to be contrary to the positive law of a country will not be applied by the latter's courts. The operation of this principle is illustrated in the case of Laane et al. v. Estonian State Cargo & Passengers S.S. Line, [1949] 2 D.L.R. 641 (S.C.C.), where the Supreme Court refused to recognize the expropriation of a ship by the decree of a foreign government due to the penal nature of the decree.
