The cruise ship "Galaxias" sailed from Piraeus, Greece, in the Spring of 1986. It proceeded through the Panama Canal and sailed up the Western Seaboard of North America having stopped in Acapulco, to engage a band of musicians. In June of 1986, the "Galaxias" sailed into Vancouver Harbour with a full crew aboard. It berthed there during the Summer of 1986 and by means of certain connections to the shore was established as a "floating hotel" for the enjoyment of visitors to the world exhibition in Vancouver, called "Expo 86", being hosted by that city.
