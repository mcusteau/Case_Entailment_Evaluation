It is my view that the definition of "seaman" is no longer bound by such terminology as "by vocation a seafaring man" and work connected therewith (Macbeth & Co. v. Chislett, [1910] A.C. 220 (H.L.). I have also reviewed the cases relating to services provided by engineers and nightwatchmen (e.g. Tito G. Llido et al. v. Vessel "Lowell Thomas Explorer" et al. and Montreal Ship Repairs Ltd., [1980] 1 F.C. 339, and I do not believe that these cases are of assistance on this point of law. These cases are readily distinguishable in that in both instances the court found that the claimant was neither on board the ship nor a member of the crew in situations quite different from the one before me.
