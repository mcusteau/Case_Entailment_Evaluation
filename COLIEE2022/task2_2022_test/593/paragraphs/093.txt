The law with respect to the ranking of liens was lucidly reviewed by Keirstead, D.J., in the case of Comeau's Sea Foods Limited et al. v. The "France and Troy", [1974] F.C. 556, at page 557:
"Priority between liens: The ranking of liens becomes important when the value of the res is insufficient to satisfy all the claims against it.
"Certain general rules have been laid down to determine priorities but these rules are subject to many exceptions.
"The order of preference between liens may be generally stated to be as follows:
(i) Cost of rendering a fund available by the sale of the res: The 'Immacolota Concezione' (1873), 9 P.D. 37;
(ii) Maritime liens;
(iii) Possessory liens;
(iv) Mortgages;
(v) Statutory liens.
"The time when a lien attaches is material in determining priorities. A maritime lien attaches when the event giving rise to the lien occurs. A possessory lien arises when the claimant obtains possession of the property. A statutory lien arises when a suit is instituted to enforce the lien."
