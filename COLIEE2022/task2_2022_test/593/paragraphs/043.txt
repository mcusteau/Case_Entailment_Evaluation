In reviewing the three Canadian cases referred to, I feel that the result in each case was dictated to some extent by the fact that the claimants were Americans, citizens of a major trading partner of our country. I can understand that our courts would be loath to lend their assistance to a party who need simply sail across a river or a lake into Canadian waters to avoid contractual obligations. I am prepared to speculate that the result reached might have been very different in the case of a limited fund where the rights of a Canadian claimant would be subordinated to those of a foreign lienholder whose existence could not have been anticipated. This appears to be the operating principle behind the majority decision in The "Halcyon Isle" (supra).
