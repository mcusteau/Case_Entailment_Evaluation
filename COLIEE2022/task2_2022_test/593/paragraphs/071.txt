Apart from the crew of the "Galaxias" on board the ship from Piraeus (their right to a maritime lien with respect to wages is beyond question), the members of the band "Passport of Acapulco" are also claiming the benefit of a maritime lien. The band members were engaged in Mexico to play aboard the "Galaxias" both en route to Vancouver and once docked there. They are claiming unpaid wages in the amount of $23,427.20.
