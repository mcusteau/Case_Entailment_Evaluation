One of the most important claims which has long been recognized as giving rise to a maritime lien is the claim for seamen's wages, including emoluments. It is perfectly in keeping with Canadian public policy that all the incidents of the seamen's right to wages and benefits be recognized as giving rise to a lien as the Greek government purports to have done. The fact that the Canadian government has not created an analogous lien to benefit Canadian sailors does not affect the validity of N.A.T.'s claim. For over sixty years, the American necessariesman has enjoyed rights superior to the Canadian necessariesman before Canadian courts by operation of the same principle of law. In my opinion, this is not a case where policy should override principle.
