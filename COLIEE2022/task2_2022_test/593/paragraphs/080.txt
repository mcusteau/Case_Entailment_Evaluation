Despite the direction given by The "Ioannis Daskelelis" et al., with respect to the treatment accorded to an American statutory maritime lien
once proven
, the onus naturally rests on the claimants to establish that their claim would be a valid maritime lien under the relevant American law. I am also mindful of the fact that in the absence of adequate proof to the contrary, I am entitled to assume that the law relating to a question before me, is the same as the law of Canada on the issue (Ship "Mercury Bell" v. Amosin et al. (1986), 66 N.R. 361; 27 D.L.R.(4th) 641 (F.C.A.).
