Ultimately, and with some reluctance, I believe that the full claim for interest as provided by Greek law must be allowed up to the date of arrest of the ship. Up until that time, the claim by N.A.T. to a maritime lien is determined by the lex loci of the claim, namely the law of Greece. Maritime liens could validly attach to her until this law was interrupted or superceded. The relevant Greek statute secures the claim of interest on unpaid contributions with a maritime lien, and this claim should be acknowledged.
