The final requirement of the tripartite test for the establishment of jurisdiction is simply stated by Mr. Justice McIntyre at page 777 of the ITO decision (supra):
"The third requirement that the law in question must be a law of Canada, as that expression is used in s. 101 of the Constitution Act, 1867, is also met because Canadian maritime law and other laws dealing with navigation and shipping come with s. 91(10) of the Constitution Act, 1867, thus confirming federal legislative competence."
