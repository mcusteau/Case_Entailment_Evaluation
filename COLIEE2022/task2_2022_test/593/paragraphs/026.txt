The first ground of attack is that the rights accorded to N.A.T. in Greek law do not amount to a maritime lien as it exists in Canadian maritime law, or any right analogous thereto. As a result, N.A.T. cannot assert a right in rem with respect to its claim before this court. For the reasons given above, this argument cannot succeed. In my view, N.A.T.'s claim in Greek law is equivalent to a Canadian maritime lien, and counsel did not proffer any evidence or authority which would permit me to conclude otherwise in the face of the uncontradicted statements by Mr. Bournis in this regard.
