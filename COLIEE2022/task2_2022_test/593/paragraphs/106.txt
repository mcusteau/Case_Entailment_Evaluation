[106]
During the course of this action, several claimants brought a motion to hold a show cause hearing with respect to a possible contempt of court on the part of N.A.T. In the face of an unequivocal order of this court to produce the Deletion Certificate which would enable the purchaser of the "Galaxias" to register the ship in Greece in its name, N.A.T. pleaded after a significant delay, that it was unable to produce such a Certificate. It argued that the issuance of such a Certificate was at the discretion of the Minister of Merchant Marine, that the latter refused to comply, that its hands were tied, and that no contempt was intended.
