Additionally, the words "place of residence" in s. 161(1) of the
Regulations
do not imply that the residence is private or to be chosen by the offender. Thus, the words "place of residence" cover both a residence chosen by the offender and a residence imposed by the NPB, for example a community shelter as in the case at bar.
