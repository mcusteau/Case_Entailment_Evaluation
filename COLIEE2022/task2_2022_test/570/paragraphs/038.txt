As Wilson, J., noted in
R. v. V.M.
, supra, it would not be very logical for the NPB to have the power to impose residency conditions on ordinary offenders who were eligible for statutory release but not have such a power over offenders who present a serious risk. Further, contrary to the applicant's argument, I feel that Russell, J.'s, judgment in
McMurray
leads to the same conclusion. Russell, J., said:
"150. Having considered the various arguments raised by counsel on this point, and having reviewed the general scheme and purpose of CCRA (with specific regard to Part II and the provisions introduced to deal with long-term offenders),
it is the view of the Court that context, scheme, purpose and the ordinary meaning of the words reveal that s. 99.1 refers to specific provisions for the purpose of making it clear that, where it is not obvious, they are to be applied to long-term offenders 'with such modifications as the circumstances require'. Other provisions not mentioned in s. 99.1 also apply to long-term offenders, but this is because the provisions themselves make it clear that this is the case. If Parliament had intended to make ss. 146 and 147 available to long-term offenders, then Parliament would have specifically said so in s. 99.1.
