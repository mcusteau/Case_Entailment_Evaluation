The starting point of our analysis is in the
Cr.C.
Under s. 753.1(1)
Cr.C.
, the Court may declare an offender who meets the following criteria a "dangerous offender":
(a) it would be appropriate to impose a sentence of imprisonment of two years or more for the offence for which the offender has been convicted;
(b) there is a substantial risk that the offender will reoffend; and
(c) there is a reasonable possibility of eventual control of the risk in the community.
