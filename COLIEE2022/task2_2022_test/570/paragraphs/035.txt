I do not share this view. To begin with, s. 134.1 deals with conditions which may be imposed by the NPB on an offender subject to a long-term supervision order:
"134.1(1) Subject to subsection (4), every offender who is required to be supervised by a long-term supervision order is subject to the conditions prescribed by subsection 161(1) of the Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations, with such modifications as the circumstances require."
