I have concluded that the Board member, in making the decision under review, asked himself the wrong question, and placed too heavy a burden on the applicant when assessing the application for leave to appeal. For the reasons given, the decision will be set aside and the application for leave to appeal referred back for reconsideration by a different Board member.
Application allowed.
