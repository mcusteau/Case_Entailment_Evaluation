Some of Ms. Milo's report, like some of Dr. Eagar's assessment above, is based on Mr. Kerth's self-reported physical limitations and is to that extent subjective, not objective evidence. Ms. Milo's report was based on a personal interview and observation of Mr. Kerth, a review of the relevant medical documentation, and a review of the Tri­bunal's materials. She summarized Mr. Kerth's medical history and discussed the significant changes to his activities of daily living. For example, Mr. Kerth reported no longer being able to do any work around the house, nor is he able to perform his hobby of tinkering with cars or working in the garden. Mr. Kerth discussed the possibility of doing sedentary jobs, but felt that he would not be able to sit for the length of time required due to the pain he experiences in sitting. Ms. Milo identified five specific work limitations:
"1) High pain level upon exertion
2) Difficulty breathing when he tries to exert himself
3) His inability to sit or stand for long periods
4) His inability to bend, lift or carry
5) No education or training beyond Grade 9 level"
She continued by explaining how these limitations would affect Mr. Kerth's employability:
"These limitations qualify him as a poor candidate for any physical work. It is my assessment these limitations restrict Ronald to employment of a sedentary and part-time nature. In order to qualify for most seden­tary positions Ronald would need to obtain further education or training. This would be difficult for Ronald given his inability to sit for long periods and the amount of pain medication Ronald is tak­ing in an effort to reduce his pain levels. This medi­cation causes him drowsiness and the inability to think clearly. This means he would probably have to further his education by correspondence which would considerably lengthen the amount of time needed to complete any education or re­training. Given Ronald's age this may not be a reasonable option."
Ms. Milo concluded her report with the following summary:
"Due to Ronald's work limitations, as listed above, he would not be able to return to his former occupation or work in a job with any physical requirements. It would be unreasonable to expect Ronald to regularly pursue substantially gainful em­ployment because of the combination of degenerative disc disease, which stated in the medical files is affecting his whole back and emphysema which was recently diagnosed. In addition, he is 59 years of age, no transferable skills and has a Grade 9 education. Realistically he is not a good candidate for retraining or upgrading. He is not employable given his education, train­ing and work history."
