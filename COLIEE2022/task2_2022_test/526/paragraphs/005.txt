The evidence also included a report from Dr. McDougall, a Rheumatology specialist. He summarized Mr. Kerth's symptoms and concluded with the following impression:
"This gentleman presents with neck and back pain, most consistent with a mechanÂ­ical origin. Today's examination revealed no neurological deficit in either the upper or lower extremities and no evidence to suggest nerve root impingement. He has had difficulties tolerating NSAID's and I agree with the use of acetaminophen, however, I suggested that he could increase the dose, depending on his needs. I reviewed specific exercise programs for both his neck and back and asked him to perform these regularly, as a matter of routine. I have placed no restrictions on him and I am hopeful that this will result in some improvement in his symptoms. He seemed satisfied with this approach and I thank you for allowing me to participate in his care."
