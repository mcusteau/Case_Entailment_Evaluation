The applicant sought leave to appeal the Review Tribunal's decision to the Pension Appeals Board. The Board has jurisdiction under s. 84 of the
Plan
to determine any question of law or fact as to whether a benefit is payable to a person and the amount of any such benefit. The hearing before the Board is a de novo hearing. The Board consists of a Chairman and Vice-chairman, each of whom are Federal Court or provincial superior court judges, and one to 10 other members all of whom are also judges. The Board hearings are heard by panels of one, three or five members of the Board. The Chairman, Vice-chairman, or appointed delegate, is responsible for decid­ing the applications for leave to appeal. In this case, the leave application was con­sidered by a member of the Board appointed for that purpose.
