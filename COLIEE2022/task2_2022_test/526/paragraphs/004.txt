The evidence upon which the Review Tribunal based its decision included Mr. Kerth's application form, on which he stated that he had stopped working because he could not stand the extreme pain in his neck, back, left leg, and left arm. He reported being able to sit and stand for only 10 min­utes at a time due to leg and back pain and that he could not lift or bend. The applica­tion package also included a medical report from Mr. Kerth's family physician, Dr. Eagar, which indicated that Mr. Kerth had arthritis of the spine with moderate cervical disc degeneration at C5/6 and C6/7, as well as marginal osteophytes of the thoracic spine. Dr. Eagar's prognosis for Mr. Kerth was poor:
"Anticipate ongoing pain and continued deterioration in neck. Unable to drive truck (shoulder checks impossible). Cramping in hands. Now unable to work."
