The extent to which the phrase "any substantially gainful occupation" in s. 42(2) of the
Plan
must take into account some of the individual's personal characteristics and not be simply a conclusion that somewhere in the world there exists employment for which this applicant is physically capable, without regard to the applicant's education background or other factors, is a matter that was raised in the application records but was not pursued in argument. Thus I do not need to deal with it, but surely the employment must be gainful for the individual and not merely an abstract possibility.
