The Board's decision denying leave reads:
"The Review Tribunal, comprised with expertise in both law and health profession matters, concluded that the applicant retains the capacity to do some type of work and therefore dismissed his appeal.
"I have reviewed the medical reports and believe that they establish the Tribunal's findings as a reasonable one. The preponderance of the medical opinion support the Tribunal's conclusion.
"The Application reveals no error in principle on the part of the Tribunal and offers no new evidence that would shift the balance in favour of a different result.
"Leave to appeal is therefore denied."
