The Review Tribunal held its hearing on March 3, 1997, at which time the applicant represented himself. The Tribunal concluded that the applicant was capable of performing light, non-demanding work:
"... The medical evidence confirms the existence of the pain and that it prevents Mr. Kerth from continuing his former occupation as a trucker. ... It is clear that Mr. Kerth is currently restricted from performing heavy physically demanding work. It is likely that this will continue into the future indefinitely. Despite this, the Panel is of the view that Mr. Kerth retains the physical capacity to perform light, non-demanding work which accom足modates his need to change position reg足ularly.
A person is defined as disabled only if he is unable to regularly pursue
any
substan足tially gainful employment. Although ad足justments are clearly required in Mr. Kerth's activities, the Panel believes he retains the capacity to do some type of work. The appeal is, therefore, dismissed."
