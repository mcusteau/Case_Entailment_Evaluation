Reed, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a decision rendered by a member of the Pension Appeals Board on July 15, 1998, refusing the applicant's request for leave to appeal a decision of the Pension Review Tribunal to the Pension Appeals Board. The Tribunal decision had denied him a disability pension on the ground that he did not meet the definition of disabled found in the
Canada Pension Plan
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8, primarily because he was still considered to be employable. The issues to be addressed are: (1) what is the standard of review applied by this court when reviewing decisions on applications for leave to appeal to the Board, and (2) is the decision under review flawed for one of the reasons set out in s. 18.1(4) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7.
