I am guided, as I must be in reviewing the Board's decision, by the reasons given for that decision. The decision reads as though the exercise that was undertaken was one in which the Tribunal's decision was assessed on its merits, rather than whether leave should be granted to appeal the Tribunal's decision. In part, it appears as though the Tribunal's decision was being assessed pursuant to the criteria used on judicial review: "the medical reports ... establish the Tribunal's findings as
a reasonable one
"; "the Application reveals
no error in principle
on the part of the Tribunal." Another part of the decision reads as though the Board member was making a decision on the merits of the applicant's application for a disability pension, rather than on his leave to appeal application: "the application offers no new evidence
that would shift the balance
in favour of a different result". The decision reads as though the Board member stepped into the role of the Board once leave has been granted and considered the merits of the application.
