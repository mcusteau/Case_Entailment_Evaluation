I find the question before me a difficult one. Hogg, Constitutional Law of Canada, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Carswell, 1985) at pp. 221-223 and pp. 227-240 deals with the effect of the Ontario legislation, and similar provisions found in statutes in the other provinces. But there is, understandably, no discussion of, say, jurisdiction of courts of one province over the Crown in the right of another province, or of the jurisdiction of this court over a provincial Crown.
