(a) in respect of a tort committed by any of its servants or agents;
(b) in respect of a breach of the duties that a person owes to his servants or agents by reason of being their employer;
(c) in respect of any breach of the duties attaching to the ownership, occupation, possession or control of property; and
(d) under any statute, or under any regulation or bylaw made or passed under the authority of any statute.
(2) No proceedings shall be brought against the Crown under clause (1)(a) in respect of an act or omission of a servant or agent of the Crown unless proceedings in tort in respect of such act or omission may be brought against that servant or agent or his personal representative.
