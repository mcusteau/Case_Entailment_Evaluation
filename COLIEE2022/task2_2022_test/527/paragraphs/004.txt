The first plaintiff is the owner of a patent. The other plaintiffs are licensees. The patent relates to a card envelope utilized in the production of laminated data cards, capable of being laminated together. Further details are unnecessary. A company, not a party to the action in this court, Polaroid Corporation, is said to be threatening to sell to the defendant laminated data cards alleged to infringe the patent. The impugned cards are to be used by the defendant in the manufacture, sale, and issue of driver's licences (a new licence, including a photograph of the holder). The acts of the defendant are alleged to infringe various claims of the patent. The usual injunctive relief is claimed, as well as damages, or an accounting of profits.
