There was no evidence that Mr. Val√®re was a knowing participant in crimes against humanity. As Justice O'Reilly stated in

Alternatively, an inference of involvement can be drawn from proof of membership in an organization primarily dedicated to human rights abuses. However, neither is present in this case."
