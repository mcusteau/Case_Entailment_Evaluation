There was no evidence before the Board that Mr. Val√®re himself ever committed a crime against humanity, nor was there any evidence that he ever did anything to assist others in the commission of such offenses. Even if he was aware of crimes committed by others, I am not satisfied, in the circumstances of this case, that this demonstrates that he shared a common purpose with the perpetrators of the crimes.
