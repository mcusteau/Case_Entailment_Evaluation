The defendants submit that there has been an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in prosecuting his action. The proceeding, instituted in 1996, became the subject of status review pursuant to Rule 380 of the
Federal Court Rules
, 1998. Based on the plaintiff's written representations that he would immediately bring a motion under Rule 220 (determination of a question of law prior to trial), the Associate Senior Prothonotary Peter A.K. Giles allowed the action to continued as a specially managed proceeding. The plaintiff was also ordered to bring his Rule 220 motion within a prescribed time, but failed to do so. The defendants submit that this further delay in the proceeding constitutes an abuse of process, that they have been prejudiced as a result and that the action should be dismissed accordingly.
