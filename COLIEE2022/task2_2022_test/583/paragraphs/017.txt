On September 8, 1999, the Registry received two letters from Mr. Robert MacRae, counsel for the plaintiff. In his first letter, Mr. MacRae advised the Court that the Notice of Change of Solicitors would be filed because of allegations raised in the defendants' motion materials against the plaintiff's solicitor of record. In his second letter, Mr. MacRae writes that a response would be filed to the defendants' motion shortly and that the plaintiff would be requesting an oral hearing of the motion.
