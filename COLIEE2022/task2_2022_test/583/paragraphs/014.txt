[14]
On August 4, 1999, the plaintiff brought a motion in writing seeking an extension of time to request a dispute resolution. The motion was dismissed on August 30, 1999 for the following reasons:
"The plaintiff has failed to explain why he did not bring a motion under Rule 220 as he undertook to do in his written submissions on status review. Moreover, the reasons provided by the plaintiff for the delay in bringing his motion for an extension of time to request a dispute resolution conference were not beyond the control of the plaintiff or his counsel and, in any event, are unacceptable. Once the action was allowed to continue following status review, the plaintiff should have paid close attention to the time frames set by the Court. In addition, the plaintiff failed to establish that a dispute resolution conference would be appropriate in the circumstances."
