[9]
On March 4, 1999, a notice of status review was issued by this Court requiring the plaintiff to show cause by April 6, 1999 why the action should not be dismissed for delay. Belatedly, the plaintiff responded to the show cause Order on April 7, 1999 by requesting a ten day extension to seek instructions from his client. On April 15, 1999, counsel for the plaintiff requested a further extension to April 30, 1999 "to ensure that Mr. Bell has the benefit of the advice of both solicitors he has consulted in this matter."
