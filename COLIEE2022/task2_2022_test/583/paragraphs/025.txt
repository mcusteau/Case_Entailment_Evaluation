[25]
On November 25, 1999, the plaintiff filed "Submissions Record of the plaintiff". In a letter to counsel for the defendants dated December 10, 1999, Mr. MacRae wrote in part:
"I ask that you be kind enough to review my submissions to satisfy yourself that all submissions relate specifically to previously filed affidavits. I requested the opportunity to file an additional affidavit of Mr. Henderson in order to ensure that, in the event I thought it necessary, I would have the permission of the Court to do so. Upon review and reflection, the previously filed affidavits were sufficient."
