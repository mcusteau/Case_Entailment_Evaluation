In considering a motion for dismissal for delay, generally the following test must be applied: whether there has been inordinate delay, whether the delay was inexcusable and whether the defendant is likely to be seriously prejudiced by the delay. However, in my view, the same test should not be applied to proceedings which have survived status review.
