On May 5, 1999, Associate Senior Prothonotary Peter A.K. Giles ordered that the plaintiff file his written submissions by May 25, 1999 and that he include a proposed timetable for the completion of the necessary steps in the proceeding. The plaintiff once again missed the deadline imposed by the Court. On May 26, 1999, his written submissions were filed in response to status review. The plaintiff wrote that if the action was allowed to continue, the plaintiff would proceed to serve and file a motion pursuant to Rule 220 by June 21, 1999 to request that the Court determine before trial his interest in Lot 226 based on an alleged inter vivos transfer by his mother.
