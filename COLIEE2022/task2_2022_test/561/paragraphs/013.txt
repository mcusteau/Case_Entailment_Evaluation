[13]
In my opinion, the Member made the following significant errors in the Decision:
1. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Member indicated that his main concern was possible inconsistencies about how the claimant got on the plane in Jaffna and how he made the journey to Colombo. These matters were addressed by counsel for the Applicant in a letter dated September 13, 2002. However, in the Decision, the Member clearly has other concerns that are significant for the Decision. These concerns relate to the Applicant's national identity card ("NIC"), his birth certificate and the evidence given by his uncle. In the process, the Applicant was denied the opportunity to answer the case against him on significant issues that appeared in the Decision. This was a reviewable error;
2. One reason for rejecting the Applicants' identity claims was the position taken by the Member towards the Applicant's birth certificate. The Member did not believe the certificate could be real because it was in English and because birth certificates are normally issued in Tamil or Sinhala. But the record clearly shows that the Tamil version appears to have been a part of the record and was overlooked by the Member. Because identity issues were so fundamental to the Decision, this was a reviewable error;
3. Not only did the Member reject the birth certificate but he also failed to deal with other evidence that clearly corroborated the Applicant's testimony that he was from Kayts in the North. In this regard the Member should have dealt with the Navy ID, the Army ID and the letter from St. Anthony's College, all of which placed the Applicant in Kayts. The Member's failure to do so was a reviewable error.
