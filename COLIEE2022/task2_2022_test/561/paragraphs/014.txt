The Respondent urges that these errors can be overlooked because the real issue of concern to the Member was the apparent lack of knowledge by the Applicant concerning the process of how someone travels from the north. Having reviewed the Applicant's account of how he completed this journey, I find nothing particularly "vague" or unconvincing in his account. But this is not sufficient reason to interfere with the Member's discretion. What does concern me is that I do not believe the errors enumerated above can be left out of account when considering the Decision as a whole. The Member states the following important conclusion:
I do not find documents presented by the claimant in support of his identity to be credible. Furthermore, the vague manner in which the claimant testified relative to how he was able to travel from the north is not persuasive of his having knowledge of the process.
