Unable to live in his birth place and to escape from the LTTE, the Applicant went to Columbo in 1995 to resume his studies and to support his mother and four sisters. While in the Mylan lodge in Columbo, the army raided the lodge. He was arrested along with other Tamils on May 22, 1995, and taken to the Kotahena police station and from there to Kegalle prison. He was then taken to Welikade prison. Since he was under 16 years of age, the prisons refused to admit him so he was eventually taken to Pannipitiya Minors jail. He was kept in detention until June 1, 1995, and was assaulted, punched and kicked. He was also burned with hot metal objects that left scars. The lodge manager contacted a relative of the Applicant who assisted the Applicant to obtain his release. He was treated by a doctor in Columbo.
