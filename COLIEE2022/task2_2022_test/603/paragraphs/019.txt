Recently, the term "generally" was interpreted in a manner that may include
segments
of the larger population, as well as
all
residents or citizens of a given country. In
Osorio v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2005 FC 1459, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1792 (QL). In that case, the applicant asserted that if he and his young Canadian born son were returned to Colombia it would constitute indirect cruel and unusual treatment/punishment because of the psychological stress that he would experience as a parent worrying about his child's welfare in that country. At paras, 24 and 26 Snider J. stated:
[24] It seems to me that common sense must determine the meaning of s. 97(1)(b)(ii) [...]
[26]
Further, I can see nothing in s. 97(1)(b)(ii) that requires the Board to interpret "generally" as applying to all citizens. The word "generally" is commonly used to mean "prevalent" or "wide-spread".
Parliament deliberately chose to include the word "generally" in s. 97(1)(
b
)(ii), thereby leaving to the Board the issue of deciding whether a particular group meets the definition. Provided that its conclusion is reasonable, as it is here, I see no need to intervene. [Emphasis added]
Snider J. concluded that the Board had not erred in its determination given that the risk described by the applicant was one faced by all Colombians who have or will have children.
