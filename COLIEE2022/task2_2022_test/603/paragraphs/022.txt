In the recent case of
Carias v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2007 FC 602, [2007] F.C.J. No. 817 (QL), at paras. 23 and 25, O'Keefe J. concluded that the applicants faced a generalized risk of economic crime which was experienced by many other Hondurans, including those perceived as wealthy. In that particular case, the Board accepted that the applicants had been the victims of violence, however, O'Keefe J. dismissed the application indicating, at para. 25, that "[t] he applicants are members of a large group of people who may be targeted for economic crimes in Honduras on basis of their perceived wealth." Further, he held that "[g] iven the wording of subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA, the applicants had to satisfy the Board that they would be personally subjected to a risk that was not generally faced by others in Honduras."
