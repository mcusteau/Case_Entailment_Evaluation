In
Shum v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, supra, McKeown, J., dealt with a situation in which, as in the present case, an applicant was refused an interview on the basis that he had less than 60 points at his prescreening, as required by s. 11.1(a)(i) of the
Regulations
. In that case, McKeown, J., held that it was not necessary for an interview to be conducted in order for a visa officer to exercise his or her discretion under s. 11(3) of the
Regulations
. He therefore allowed the application for judicial review and remitted the matter to another visa officer for redetermination. McKeown, J., certified a question of general importance, but his decision was not appealed.
