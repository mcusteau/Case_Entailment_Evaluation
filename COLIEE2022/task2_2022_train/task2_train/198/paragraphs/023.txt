  I also believe it was open to the Board to discount the Applicant's testimony that she believed she could not practise Falun Gong in private in China. While I do not necessarily agree with the Board's conclusion, it was not patently unreasonable for the Board to find the Applicant's explanation was not credible. I note, however, that although the Board's questions as to why the Applicant could not practise Falun Gong in private in China may have assisted the Board in determining credibility, I find these questions disturbing within the context of a refugee hearing. Such questions presuppose that it might be acceptable for a person to be forced to practise Falun Gong in private. A Falun Gong supporter should not have to choose between practising alone and practising openly with her group. Nonetheless, the question was asked, the answer was somewhat puzzling, and an adverse inference was drawn from it. Read in that context, I am not convinced that the Board's finding was patently unreasonable.
