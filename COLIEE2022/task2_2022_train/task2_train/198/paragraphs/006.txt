  The Board noted that the same interpreter, Mr. Mike Yang, had signed all seven PIFs, and that he had testified in one of the cases held prior the Applicant's hearing. Mr. Yang had referred the claimants to Mr. Savaglio, the Applicant's counsel. Mr. Yang said he had developed a list of questions regarding Falun Gong claims. The Board felt that the list had been employed from around February 2002 until mid-May 2004, despite the interpreter's claim that he used the questions for only a short time.
