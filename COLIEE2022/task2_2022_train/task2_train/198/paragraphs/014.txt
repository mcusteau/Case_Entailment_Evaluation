  In reaching this conclusion, the Board took note of the original summons document supplied by the Applicant, but gave it little weight because fraudulent documents are readily available in this kind of situation. The photographs of the Applicant practising Falun Gong were also given little weight because anyone can join a Falun Gong group in Canada, and the Applicant had approximately fifteen months after arriving in Canada to learn Falun Gong. On a balance of probabilities, the Board held it was likely that the Applicant had learned Falun Gong to support her refugee claim.
