  The Applicant decided she could not live under the imposed conditions. She left her then eight-year-old son in the care of her parents and came to Canada, where she made a refugee claim. She alleges that she learned that the PSB subsequently searched her home in an attempt to locate her, and that a Neighborhood Committee periodically visits.
