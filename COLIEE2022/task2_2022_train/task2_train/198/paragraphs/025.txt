  The Board is, of course, entitled to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense (Shahamati v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 415 (QL) (C.A.) to draw negative inferences. However, in this case, I do not believe that common sense dictates that simply because the seven PIFs were similar, it is more likely than not that the Applicant's narrative is not true. And I believe that such a conclusion ignores the evidence before the Board as to why the PIFs were similar.
