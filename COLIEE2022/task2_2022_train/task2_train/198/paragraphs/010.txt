  The Board also found the Applicant's explanation for her decision to leave China was not credible. She had left her son behind. She said she feared her migraine headaches and neck pains (experienced before becoming a practitioner of Falun Gong) would return. When asked why she could not continue to practise Falun Gong in private in China, she said that while doing the fifth exercise (a sitting position with legs crossed) she was unable to stand up, and if the PSB intruded, they would think she was practicing Falun Gong. The Board found this explanation implausible given the Applicant's previous ability to practise privately undetected for 32 months. The Board suggested that, in essence, the Applicant was asking the Board to believe that her difficulties in resuming the secret practise of Falun Gong outweighed the advantages of remaining in China with her son.
