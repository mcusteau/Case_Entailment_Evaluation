  The Board held that because the Applicant's PIF was similar to other PIFs, her account must be "insufficiently personal to be credible." In my view, this leap from determining that the PIFs were similar to concluding that the account in her PIF was not her personal experience is a reviewable error. Mr. Yang wrote the Applicant's account into a template. Within this template, the Applicant's personal experiences are still obvious. The PIF details the date she joined an underground Falun Gong movement, the events leading to her arrest, and her release.
