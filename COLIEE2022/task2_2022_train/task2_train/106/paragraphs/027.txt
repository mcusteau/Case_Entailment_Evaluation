 [27] 
  In response to the motion, Apotex submits that the Defendants clearly failed to demonstrate that striking Apotex's pleadings is warranted. Apotex submits that it was wholly proper and not at all speculative for Apotex to have named SPIL as a defendant in the underlying action. In fact, Apotex characterizes this motion as another attempt by the Defendants to delay the underlying action from proceeding on its merits.
