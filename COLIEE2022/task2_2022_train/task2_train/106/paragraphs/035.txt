  In my opinion, Caterpillar, supra, and Painblanc, supra, are not in conflict with the Hunt v. Carey standard for striking pleadings. These cases all concern the sufficiency of pleadings. They start from the premise that the purpose of pleadings is to ensure that the opposing party knows the case to be met. The party pleading has an obligation to plead the material facts upon which the general allegation is based. If material facts are not pleaded, then the pleadings may be struck on the grounds that they do not disclose a reasonable cause of action.
