 [33] 
  Striking a pleading is a draconian measure. A statement of claim should not be struck out on the ground that it is vexatious, frivolous or an abuse of the process of the Court, unless the plaintiff's claim is "so clearly futile that it has not the slightest chance of succeeding": Creaghan Estate v. The Queen, [1972] F.C. 732 at para. 6, (1972) 72 DTC 6215 (F.C.T.D.).
