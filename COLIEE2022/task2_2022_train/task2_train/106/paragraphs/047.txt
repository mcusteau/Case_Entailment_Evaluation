  The Defendants submit that they can satisfy the three branches of the test. They argue that a serious issue is raised on the motion, namely should SPIL be struck as a co-defendant to the action by reason of there being no evidence to support its involvement as pleaded. Further, the Defendants submit that failing to grant a stay will result in irreparable harm to the Defendants because Roche and SPIL may be required to produce confidential materials to a competitor and the damages that would flow from such disclosure is irreparable. At the hearing, the Defendants further argued that if discovery were allowed to proceed, it may allow Apotex to obtain some information to maintain SPIL as a defendant or which may identify others as potential co-defendants to the action. The Defendants argue that this would constitute irreparable harm for the purposes of this interlocutory application. Finally, the Defendants submit that the balance of convenience favours the Defendants because the above harm far outweighs the inconvenience to Apotex of adjourning discovery considering that the underlying action was started more than four years ago.
