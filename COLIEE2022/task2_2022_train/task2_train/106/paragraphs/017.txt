[17] 
  Discretionary orders of prothonotaries ought not be disturbed on appeal unless: 
 
 
 
 a) the questions raised in the motion are vital to the final issue of the case; or 
 
 
 
 b) the orders are clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts. 
 
 
 
 In such circumstances, the reviewing judge ought to exercise her or his own discretion de novo: Canada v. Aqua-Gem Investments Ltd, [1993] 2 F.C. 425, F.C.J. No. 103 (QL), as reformulated in Merck & Co. v. Apotex Inc., [2004] 2 F.C.R. 459, (2003) 30 C.P.R. (4th) 40 at para. 19.
