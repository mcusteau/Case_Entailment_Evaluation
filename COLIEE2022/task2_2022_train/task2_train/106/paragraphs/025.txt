  The Defendants acknowledge that SPIL is the owner of the '671 patent, was a party to the prohibition proceeding, and is a company related to Roche. The Defendants argue that these factors are not relevant to the threshold question of whether Apotex has a reasonable basis for asserting that SPIL controls Roche. As the patent holder, the Defendants submit, SPIL was required, by virtue of the s. 6(4) of the NOC Regulations, to be made a party to the prohibition proceedings. Furthermore, as Roche and SPIL are among the 300 companies within the Roche family of pharmaceutical companies, the fact that SPIL and Roche are related is not sufficient to establish that SPIL has control over Roche.
