  Apotex subsequently commenced an action for a declaration that the manufacture and sale of its naproxen slow-release tablets would not infringe the claim of the '671 patent and that the '671 patent was invalid. On April 19, 1999, Reed J. found in Apotex's favour on both grounds: Apotex v. Syntex Pharmaceuticals International Limited, (1999), 1 F.T.R. 161, [1999] F.C.J. No. 548 (QL), (1999), 1 C.P.R. (4th) 22. In a subsequent motion by Apotex, Reed J. also set aside the prohibition order: Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare), (1999) 167 F.T.R. 111, [1999] F.C.J. No. 662 (QL).
