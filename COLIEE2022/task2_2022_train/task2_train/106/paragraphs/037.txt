 [37] 
  Similarly in Painblanc, supra, the Court granted a motion to strike because the material facts pleaded did not establish a basis for personal liability on the part of Mr. Painblanc. The pleadings alleged that he "alone and/or in concert with others directly authorized and is directly and solely responsible for ... the operation of" the defendant company. The only material fact pleaded in support of that allegation was that Mr. Painblanc was the Chief Executive Officer and majority and controlling shareholder of the defendant company. The Court found that this material fact alone was insufficient to satisfy the legal test to establish personal liability.
