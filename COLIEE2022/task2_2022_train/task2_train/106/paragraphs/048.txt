  Apotex opposes the Defendants' motion for a stay of proceedings. Apotex argues that there is no serious issue raised and that, in fact, the Defendants' motion for a stay is frivolous and/or vexatious. Apotex further submits that the Defendants have not provided any evidentiary basis to support their assertion that they would suffer irreparable harm or that the Defendants will be inconvenienced if the discovery process is not stayed.
