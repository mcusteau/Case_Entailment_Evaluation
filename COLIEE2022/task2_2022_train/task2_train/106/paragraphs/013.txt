  The Defendants submitted that the evidence of the Apotex representatives clearly establish that Apotex has no evidential basis to plead the facts alleged in its amended claim in respect of the relationship between Roche and SPIL. The Defendants further submitted that the Apotex representatives admit that Apotex wants to use the discovery process in order to identify the proper defendants. On these grounds, the Defendants moved to strike out Apotex's amended claim as it applies to SPIL.
