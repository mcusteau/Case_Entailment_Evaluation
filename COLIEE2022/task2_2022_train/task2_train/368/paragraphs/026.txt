The applicant argues that the regulations do not permit visa officers to consider "flexibility" or education in determining personal suitability. Flexibility is not specified among the enumerated qualities to be assessed under Schedule I, Factor 9, in determining personal suitability. The job offer did not include "flexibility" as a job requirement, except in relation to hours of work. In addition, by considering the applicant's educational performance in assessing personal suitability, it is urged that the officer double-counted education, considering it under both the factors of personal suitability and of education.
