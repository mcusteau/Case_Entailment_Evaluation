Further, the Applicants fail the third branch of the
Law
test. As set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Granovsky v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 703; 253 N.R. 329; 2000 SCC 28, at paragraph 58, while a financial deprivation may exist it must be shown that the legislation promotes the view that a person is less capable or less worthy of recognition or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian society:
"58 The question therefore is not just whether the appellant has suffered the deprivation of a financial benefit, which he has, but whether the deprivation promotes the view that persons with temporary disabilities are 'less capable, or less worthy of recognition or value as human beings or as members of Canadian society, equally deserving of concern, respect, and consideration' (emphasis added). In
Miron v. Trudel
, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 418, McLachlin, J., noted, at para. 132, that 'distinctions made on enumerated or analogous grounds may prove to be, upon examination, non-discriminatory'."
