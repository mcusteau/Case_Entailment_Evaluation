Horace had been in the Chateau Westmount facility since June 2000 and remained there until his death in June 2006. However, the initial decision and all subsequent decisions of the DVA limited the time period over which reimbursement was made to the period from October 2004 to June 2006. The first decision of February 14, 2005 does not say why this time frame was adopted. The review decision of November 15, 2005, the text of which was repeated earlier said that October 2004 was the time "... when [Horace's] health needs [are] confirmed by a nurse's or area counsellor's assessment."
