Both parties agree that the standard of review as it applies to any determination of law, including construction of a statute or regulation, is that of correctness. In respect of a finding of fact, the Respondent argues that the standard is patent unreasonableness, and the Applicants argue that the standard is simply reasonableness. It is not necessary to resolve this difference in positions since the relevant facts are agreed and the issue resolves itself into what the parties did and said in making submissions prior to and in respect of the decision under review, as far as the Applicants are concerned, and findings in the decision of the DVA as for as the Respondent is concerned.
