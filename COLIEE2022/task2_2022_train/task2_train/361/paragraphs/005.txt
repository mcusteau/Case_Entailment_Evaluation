In about October 2004, Ronald was informed, by coincidence, that Horace might be eligible to receive benefits from DVA to alleviate the expenses paid for his care at Chateau Westmount. On October 8, 2004, Ronald filed an application with DVA on his father's behalf for receipt of benefits in respect of the care he was receiving. Subsequently, DVA advised Ronald that his father would be entitled to benefits of $4,063.44 per month. Payments of those benefits were made effective as of October 2004. However, the claim for reimbursement retroactive to the date that Horace entered the care facility on June 17, 2000 was denied. The Applicants now seek recovery of all or a portion of the money spent on care facilities for Horace between June 17, 2000 and October 2004 or at least declarations as to entitlement to the same and other relief.
