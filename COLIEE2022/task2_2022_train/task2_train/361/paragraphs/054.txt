The Applicants rely on the decision of Strayer, J., of this Court in
Trotter v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2005] 4 F.C.R. 193; 272 F.T.R. 1; 2005 FC 434, to argue that any limitation imposed by subsection 34.1(4) should not be read so as to limit the quantum of the claim so long as the claim itself is made in a timely fashion. They rely in particular on a passage found within paragraph 18 of that decision and paragraph 20:
"18 I wish to emphasize that the language of subsection 39(1) was not adopted as such in respect of prisoners of war and evaders' compensation. It will be noted that subsection 39(1), limiting as it does payments to the date of application, by its terms applies to 'a pension awarded for disability'. In my view, compensation for prisoners of war is not 'a pension awarded for disability'. Even in the provisions adopted in 1987 by way of amendments to the
Pension Act
specifically applying to these persons, the new subsection 71.2(1) provides that 'a prisoner of war is entitled, on application, to basic compensation.' Such was the language of the 1976
Act
which also said [at section 3] that: 'a prisoner of war ... is entitled on application to the Commission, to compensation.' As I have noted, the circumstances of the passage of the 1976
Act
and the provisions for a retroactive coming into force indicate that what was intended was that compensation be effective as of April 1, 1976. This was said to be payable 'on application', as does subsection [page 206] 71.2(1) of the
Pension Act
. In the context of the 1976
Act
that expression 'on application' made an authenticated application a condition precedent to receiving compensation, but the date of the application did not define the amount of compensation. Not only was that, I suggest, the intention of Parliament but it was the manner in which that
Act
was administered throughout its existence. It is true that subsection 71.2(1) which states the entitlement to compensation commences with the words '[s]ubject to subsection (4)'. Subsection (4), does make section 39 generally applicable to compensation for former prisoners of war. However, it is applicable 'with any modifications that the circumstances require.' In my view, circumstances require a different approach in the matter of entitlement to compensation for former prisoners of war and evaders.
"20 I believe that by the general cross-reference in subsection 71.2(4) of the
Pension Act
to most sections of Part III of that
Act
, making them applicable to compensation, Parliament cannot be taken to have made a specific decision to reduce the compensation payable to former prisoners of war or evaders who happened not to have applied before because they did not know they were entitled to compensation. It would have been legally, if perhaps not politically, easy to so provide in the amendments if that was intended. In the circumstances, subsection 39(1) must be taken as inappropriate in reference to prisoners' compensation and the qualification in subsection 71.2(4) of the applicability of Part III 'with any modifications that the circumstances require' to prisoners' compensation must be taken to mean that subsection 39(1) is not applicable."
