[64]
As to costs, the Minister suggested no costs, the Applicants wanted solicitor-client costs. Costs at the solicitor-client level are usually only awarded where the conduct of the losing party during the course of the proceedings has been questionable. That is not the case here. The Applicants' counsel suggested that this is in the nature of a "test case". I do not view it that way. The circumstances factually are unique and the
Regulations
have been amended in any event. Applicants' counsel suggested that an award of costs should include costs incurred in dealing with the Minister leading up to the decision of May 5, 2006. The Court has no power to award such costs.
