Much was made in argument as what was the date the claim was made and what was the date of notification. The evidence is not clear as to what exactly happened on October 2004 therefor, I must take as admissions and binding upon the parties, the statements that the Applicants through their Counsel made in the course of making submissions to the Minister and, in respect of the Minister, the statements and findings in the Hebert, May 5, 2006 decision.
