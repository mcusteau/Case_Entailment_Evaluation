The evidence is clear that during the period in question when Horace was placed in a long-term care facility in the year 2000, the DVA had a substantial programme directed to the public and to veterans as to the services and benefits offered to veterans. An extensive website was available to the public. Brochures were made available at regional offices, fairs and exhibitions and to anyone asking for information. Cheques sent to veterans included informational stubs and slips. Little effort would have been required of Ronald or anyone else to initiate inquires and receive information as to services and benefits available. The evidence is that while Ronald did make efforts and communicated with the DVA about reinstatement of his father's pension respecting his knee injury, he took no steps to inform the DVA about the medical assessment made in 2000 as to his father's mental condition or the reason for his placement, at the instance of Ronald, in Chateau Westmount. Ronald had advised the DVA to communicate with Horace at Ronald's United States address and that is what happened. Horace was never actually at the United States address.
