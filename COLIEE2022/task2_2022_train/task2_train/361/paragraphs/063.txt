The
Regulations
are not well drafted and not easy to interpret. The parties appeared unwilling to make reasonable compromises. The Applicants took an "I want it all approach". The Minister took a "you will get nothing more" approach. This determination is an attempt to do justice to all sides and to the
Regulations
. The Minister should review the matter on the basis that the Applicants, Horace's estate and Ronald, should be reimbursed for monthly expenses incurred during the 18 month period prior to October, 2004. The amount of $4,064.44 per month is seen by all parties as appropriate. An award of interest is appropriate. The rate requested, prevailing prime lending rates plus 1% is appropriate.
