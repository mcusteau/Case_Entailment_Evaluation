[18]
I add one further reason. As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in
Almrei v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2005] 3 F.C.R. 142; 330 N.R. 73; 2005 FCA 54, at paragraph 71, "there are such things in the field of legislative drafting as oversights". At paragraphs 59 to 77, the Court considered the failure of Parliament to specify that section 78 of the
Act
applies to an application for judicial release made under subsection 84(2) of the
Act
. The Court concluded that Parliament "presumed or implicitly intended" that the section 78 procedure would apply to application for release.
