The parties agree that the Court must grant deference to the Minister's exercise of discretion on questions of national interest. Therefore, the applicable standard of review to be applied to the Minister's decision is patent unreasonableness. I adopt the pragmatic and functional analysis conducted by Chief Justice Lutfy in

(2006), 297 F.T.R. 203; 2006 FC 912 and agree that the standard of review is patent unreasonableness.
