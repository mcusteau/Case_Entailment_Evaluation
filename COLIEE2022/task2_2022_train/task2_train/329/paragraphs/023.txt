In my view, prior jurisprudence of this Court establishes that the first decision is properly reviewable. The significance of this in the present case flows from the fact that the first and second decisions are quite different. The second decision, made after the first application was filed and perfected, is materially more detailed than the first. For example, in the second decision the officer had regard to the definition of "terrorism" before concluding that the MQM-A is a terrorist organization. On Mr. Naeem's behalf it is argued that the second decision is an attempt to bolster the reasons given in the first decision by addressing the concerns he raised in the written argument filed in the first application.
