I do note that in the present case, the "second decision" of May 8, 2006 was materially expanded upon, as discussed above. This seems to be contrary to the instructions found in IP 10. Further, Mr. Naeem was not invited to provide further submissions to the officer before the May 8, 2006 memorandum was prepared. If this was a new final decision, based upon additional considerations, fairness would have required that Mr. Naeem be given an opportunity to make further submissions, particularly in view of the officer's apparently changed view of Mr. Naeem's credibility (or at the least, the altered expression of her opinion as to his credibility).
