In response, Mr. Naeem argued that:
(i) Rules 317 and 318 of the
Federal Courts Rules
have no application because they are expressly excluded from application in immigration matters by Rule 4(1) of the
Federal Courts Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules
, and because Rules 317 and 318 are not intended to apply where the objection to disclosure is based upon national security concerns.
(ii) Disclosure could be governed by section 38.01 of the
Canada Evidence Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.
(iii) A fundamental principle of the administration of justice is the open court system.
(iv) There must be clear, established legislative authority and clear criteria to set out the basis upon which the Court will determine whether or not information can be withheld.
(v) Rule 318 provides no such criteria.
