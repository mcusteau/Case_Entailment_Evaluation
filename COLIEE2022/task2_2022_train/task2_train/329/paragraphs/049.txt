Canadian Union of Public Employees et al. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour)
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539; 304 N.R. 76; 173 O.A.C. 38, at paragraphs 164 and 165 Mr. Justice Binnie, for the majority of the Court, explained review on the standard of patent unreasonableness in the following terms:
"164. However, applying the more deferential patent unreasonableness standard, a judge should intervene if persuaded that there is no room for reasonable disagreement as to the decision maker's failure to comply with the legislative intent. In a sense, like the correctness standard, the patently unreasonable standard admits only one answer. A correctness approach means that there is only one proper answer. A patently unreasonable one means that there could have been many appropriate answers, but not the one reached by the decision maker.
"165. A patently unreasonable appointment, then, is one whose defect is 'immedia[te] or obviou[s]' (
Southam
, supra, at para. 57), and so flawed in terms of implementing the legislative intent that no [page 616] amount of curial deference can properly justify letting it stand (
Ryan
, supra, at para. 52)."
6. What are the reasons of the Minister for his negative decision?
