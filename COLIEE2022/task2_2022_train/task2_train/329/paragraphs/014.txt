The Minister argued that there exists a gap in the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/2004-283 and the
Federal Courts Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules
, SOR/93-22 for dealing with information which a tribunal does not disclose, on grounds of national security, in the record it files with the Court. Accordingly, he relies upon the Federal Courts' gap rule, Rule 4, to argue that the Court could use the procedure found in Rules 317 and 318. Those three rules are set out in Schedule B to these reasons.
