Third, the Minister's guidelines are intended to be instructive to the official responsible for preparing the memorandum and recommendation to the Minister. As the Supreme Court explained in
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; 281 N.R. 1, at paragraph 36, its review of the Minister's discretion in
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; 243 N.R. 22 was based upon the failure of the Minister's officials to comply with ministerial guidelines. In
Baker
, at paragraphs 72, the Court described the ministerial guidelines as "a useful indicator of what constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the power" conferred by the applicable section of the
Act
. The "fact that this decision was contrary to their directives is of great help in assessing whether the decision was an unreasonable exercise" of the discretion conferred by the
Act
.
