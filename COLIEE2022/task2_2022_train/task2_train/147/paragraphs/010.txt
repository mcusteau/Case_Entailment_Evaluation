  There is no dispute that in respect of questions of procedural fairness, the Court will intervene if, applying the correctness standard, there is a breach ( 
 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa 
 , 2009 SCC 12, at para 43;  
 Gulati 
 , above, at para 20). With respect to the officer's assessment of the evidence, or lack thereof, this is a question that is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness ( 
 Malik v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 1283 at para 22;  
 Gulati 
 , above, at para 18).
