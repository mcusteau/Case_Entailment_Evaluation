The Board found that since many persons come to Canada without friends or relatives who are already established here, the fact that the Respondent had no such contacts did not present a flight risk. The Board noted that there is a general flight risk for those arriving in Canada in the circumstances of the Respondent. This, and the potential for an eventual removal order, could be mitigated by strong terms and conditions. The Board imposed terms and conditions, including weekly reporting requirements and a stipulation that he not associate with criminal organizations, but refused to impose a cash bond.
