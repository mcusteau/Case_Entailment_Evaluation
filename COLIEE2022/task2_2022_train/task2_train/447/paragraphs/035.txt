The Board's reasons make it clear that it did consider whether the Respondent would appear for an admissibility hearing and that, at the same time, it was aware of the potential for the Respondent to eventually face a removal order. The Board found that the Applicant's allegation of the Respondent's membership in the LTTE is not straightforward, thereby giving the Respondent an incentive to present himself for the admissibility hearing. The Board found that the flight risk that could arise from the potential of an eventual removal order could be mitigated by strong terms and conditions.
