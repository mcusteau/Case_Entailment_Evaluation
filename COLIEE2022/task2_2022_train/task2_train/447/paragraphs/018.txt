The first matter to be addressed is the appropriate standard of review. Having regard to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
New Brunswick (Board of Management) v. Dunsmuir
, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190; 372 N.R. 1; 329 N.B.R.(2d) 1; 844 A.P.R. 1; 2008 SCC 9, there are now only two standards of review, that is correctness and reasonableness. Questions of law and issues of procedural fairness will be reviewed on the standard of correctness. Questions of fact and questions of mixed fact and law are subject to review on the standard of reasonableness.
