The Applicant argues that instead of considering whether the Respondent is likely to appear for his removal, the Board focused on whether the Respondent could successfully defend the allegation of inadmissibility. In other words, he submits that the Board concentrated on whether the Respondent will likely be removed from Canada, not whether he is likely to appear for removal if so ordered. Relying on the decision in
Sahin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1995] 1 F.C. 214; 85 F.T.R. 99 (T.D.), the Applicant argues that persons may be detained if the Minister is of the opinion that they will not appear for a removal order if one is issued.
