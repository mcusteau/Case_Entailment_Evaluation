[45]
This case is distinguishable from the facts in
B157
. The key factual difference is the strength of the allegation that B157 is a member of the LTTE in that case. Further, it is my opinion that the Board in this case meaningfully addressed the submissions of the Applicant with regard to the debt the Respondent owes to the smugglers and the allegation that the Respondent is a member of the LTTE in considering subsection 245(f) of the
Regulations
.
