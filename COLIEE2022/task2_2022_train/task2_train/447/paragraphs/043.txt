There is nothing unreasonable in the Board's analysis of the Respondent's lack of ties to Canada. The wording of subsection 245(g) simply asks the Board to consider the existence of strong ties to a community in Canada. This language gives no direction that the existence of such ties is a positive or negative factor to be considered in assessing whether someone is a flight risk. While this is a factor militating towards continued detention, the Member did not find that it overrode other considerations.
