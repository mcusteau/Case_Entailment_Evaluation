[17]
When an applicant applies to this Court for a discretionary order, as is the case here, his conduct must be beyond reproach (
Kouchek v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1995] F.C.J. No. 323 (T.D.)). The relevant facts in support of the application for leave and judicial review must be submitted fully and objectively to the Court. In cases where the applicant has dismissed his former counsel, the new counsel must be especially vigilant. This is all the more important when an applicant makes serious charges that not only question the impartiality of panel members but also the professional skills, even the integrity and honesty, of his former representative.
