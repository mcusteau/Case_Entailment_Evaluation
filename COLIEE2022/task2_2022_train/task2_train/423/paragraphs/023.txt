On the allegations of bias made by the applicant, in
Commission Canadienne des droits de la Personne v. Malo et al.
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 750; 2003 FC 811, Pinard, J., noted that the leading case in Canada is still the decision by the Supreme Court in 1978 in
Committee for Justice and Liberty Foundation et al. v. National Energy Board et al.
, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369; 9 N.R. 115. As DeGrandpr√©, J., indicated at pages 394-95, the Court must consider what an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through, would conclude. The grounds for the fear of bias must be substantial and the basic principle is the same: natural justice must be rendered. However, in practice the particular nature of the tribunal must be taken into account.
