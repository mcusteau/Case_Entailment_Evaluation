The first day of hearing before the panel was on July 20, 2001. During his testimony, the applicant disclosed that he was a sympathizer, though not a member, of the Rebirth Party, El-Nahda, which is prohibited in Tunisia. It sometimes happened that he had to speak of the party at the mosque. As the police suspected him of belonging to this group, they beat him and tortured him. Further, since he has been in Canada, he said he has been in contact with influential members of the group, including its leader, Mr. Rachid Ghanouchi, with whom he has regular telephone conversations. These individuals also helped him economically in settling in Canada, and it was through Mr. Ghanouchi that he was able to obtain work as a copying clerk with the Barreau du Qu√©bec. In 2001, he expressed his wish to become a member of the El-Nahda party and so obtained the identifying information on certain members. However, he did not pursue this idea. Based on these new facts, the panel decided to adjourn the hearing to October 17, 2001, to allow the Minister to intervene, if necessary.
