Further, the right to the services of counsel relied on by the applicant here is only a complement to the rules of natural justice and fairness. It is recognized that the adviser of a claimant before the panel does not have to be a lawyer. In this connection, whatever the status and professional expertise of the applicant's former representative, it is clear that there was no infringement of the rules of natural justice here. In all respects, the applicant had an opportunity to present evidence and intervene in the argument to present his point of view and correct any inaccuracy in his story. I therefore consider that the applicant has not suffered any irreparable harm.
