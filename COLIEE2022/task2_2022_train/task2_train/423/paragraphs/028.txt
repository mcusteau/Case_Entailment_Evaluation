The applicant further alleged that the panel failed to rule on the motion for disqualification and a de novo hearing based on the fact that the applicant had been the victim of an adviser who had incorrectly presented herself as a lawyer.

Accordingly, if he was dissatisfied with her representation the applicant should have taken steps to remedy the problem at that time.
