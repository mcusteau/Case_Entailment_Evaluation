It is comparatively easy for an applicant to make allegations in an application for judicial review about the status or incompetence of a former representative. However, such allegations inevitably have serious consequences for the person in question and that person's reputation. Accordingly, I am not prepared to accept the allegations made by the applicant here without some form of proceeding. There is also the fact that the applicant took no steps to correct the problem, and according to the evidence in the record the applicant (though he was already employed by the Barreau du Qu√©bec) took no specific action with the Barreau.
