In
Ithibu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.C.J. No. 499; 202 F.T.R. 233, at paragraph 68 (T.D.), Blais, J., endorsed the following observations by Brown and Evans in
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada
(Toronto, Canvasback Publishing, 1998), at pp. 11-31 and 11-32:
"Nor will an expression of momentary impatience or loss of equanimity by a tribunal member result in disqualification, particularly where it was merely an attempt to control the manner of proceeding. Similarly, a sarcastic comment when a party refused to give evidence, or an ill-chosen and insensitive phrase, will not, without more, lead to disqualification." (Footnotes omitted)
