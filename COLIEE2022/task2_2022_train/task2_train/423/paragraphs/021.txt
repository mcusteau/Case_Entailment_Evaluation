Apart from special circumstances, it is not proper for this Court to intervene before a panel has made a final decision. For justice to be effectively administered, it is important to avoid breaking up proceedings and the delay and needless expense that would otherwise result:
Szczecka v. Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 934; 170 N.R. 58 (F.C.A.). There are no special or exceptional circumstances here to justify intervention by this Court (
Air Canada v. Lorenz et al.
, [2000] 1 F.C. 494; 175 F.T.R. 211; [2000] F.C.J. No. 494, at paragraph 50 (T.D.)).
