  This case was complicated by the involvement of other members of the family subject to arrest and removal and the language barrier. I find no fault in the actions of Officers Atkinson and Peterdy. But the possibility of confusion and error should have been considered by the Operations Manager when there was contradictory affidavit evidence before her. In my view, the Manager's factual finding that the release condition had been breached was patently unreasonable in light of that evidence. Further, no rational explanation was provided as to why the evidence did not provide a justification for not forfeiting the deposit. I conclude, therefore, that the decision was unreasonable and should be overturned.
