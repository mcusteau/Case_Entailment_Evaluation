 Tsang 
 , Justice Dawson noted that counsel for the Minister had confirmed in oral argument that it was the Minister's position that the officer could, as a matter of law, have made a decision that resulted in only a portion of the sum of the amount of the bond being collectible. This discretion was said to reside in the operation of ss. 24.1, 24.2, and 25 of the  
 Financial Administration Act 
 , R.S., c. F-10, s. 1 and the  
 Debt Write-off Regulations, 1994 
 , SOR/94-602. At issue in  
 Tsang
