 Mosley, J. 
 : Ms. Myong Sook Kang paid a cash deposit of $5,000 to secure her elderly mother's release from immigration detention. One of the release conditions was that the mother, Ms. Sun Bi Lee, reside at her daughter's address "at all times". Ms. Lee was absent one day when Canada Border Services Agency officers visited to inquire about other family members. Several months later, after Ms. Lee had returned home to Korea, the Operations Manager of the Greater Toronto Enforcement Centre declared the $5,000 deposit forfeited. Ms. Kang seeks judicial review of that decision. These are my reasons for concluding that the Operations Manager erred in exercising her discretion. I will, therefore, grant the application and remit the matter for consideration by another manager.
