  In this instance, Manager Gilker deposes that anything in her affidavit that is based on information and belief is so described. I infer from this that anything not so identified, the remainder of the affidavit, purports to be based on her personal knowledge. That includes three paragraphs which describe what Officer Atkinson learned on March 12, 2005 and the interviews conducted by Officer Peterdy in the ensuing days. Manager Gilker's description of those events can only be based on the information gained from the notes rather than from her personal knowledge. In my view, it was improper for Manager Gilker to recite in her affidavit as fact, statements attributed to Officer Atkinson and to the applicant and her mother by Officer Peterdy in his notes. That was second hand information and should clearly have been identified as such in the affidavit.
