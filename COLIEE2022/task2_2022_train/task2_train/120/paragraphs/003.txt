  As the facts underlying the forfeiture decision are disputed, I think it appropriate to review them in some detail. Ms. Lee, a 74 year-old widow, had entered Canada without a visa in September, 1998. Following an unsuccessful claim to refugee status, refusal of an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate grounds and a negative pre-removal risk assessment, Ms. Lee failed to report for removal as directed in February, 2004. She was arrested on an immigration warrant on November 29, 2004. Health problems precluded her immediate removal and she was released from immigration detention on December 16, 2004 to live with her daughter, Ms. Kang.
