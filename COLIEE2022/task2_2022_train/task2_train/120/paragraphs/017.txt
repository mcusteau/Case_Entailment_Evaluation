  In another recent decision,  
 Khalife v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.C.J. No. 293; 287 F.T.R. 306; 2006 FC 221, the conclusion I reached was that the proper standard of review to be applied to a forfeiture decision was reasonableness. In  
 Khalife 
 , the issue was whether the officer had exercised her discretion properly in deciding to order the forfeiture of 50% of the cash bond. It was not contested in that case that the officer had the discretion not to forfeit the bond or to forfeit a lesser amount. In this matter, the position taken by the respondent is that the officer had no discretion to exercise, once she determined that there had been a breach of a release condition. That is a question of law reviewable on the correctness standard. I remain of the view that, overall, the decision to forfeit a cash bond should withstand scrutiny on the reasonableness standard.
