  In a letter dated May 3, 2005, Ms. Kang was informed that she had until June 10, 2005 to provide written reasons why the bond should not be forfeited for those reasons. The applicant replied through counsel on May 24, 2005 stating that Ms. Lee had been living at the required address, with occasional visits to her other daughter's home in Toronto to see her grandchildren. When CBSA officials came to visit on March 12, 2005 she was at church for morning Prayer and breakfast. This was supported by affidavits from Ms. Kang, her son-in-law and a letter from an associate pastor at the church submitted with the request for return of the deposit.
