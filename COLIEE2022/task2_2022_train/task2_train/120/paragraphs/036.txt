  Counsel for the respondent fairly acknowledged that the position set out in the former legislation was and still is reflected in the  
 Citizenship and Immigration Canada Enforcement Manual 
 . Former s. 7.5 of Chapter 8 of the  
 Manual 
  (as cited in  
 Uanseru 
 ) advised Officers that, in exercising their statutory authority in relation to the forfeiture of bonds, each case was to be considered on its own merits. Section 6.8 of the current  
 Enforcement Manual 
  states: 
 
 
 
 "The rules of procedural fairness require that a CIC or CBSA officer not recommend forfeiture of a deposit or realize a guarantee executed by a third party until that person is given an opportunity to make a written representation concerning the decision to be made. 
 
 
 
 "When a breach of conditions occurs that will result in forfeiture of a deposit or action to realize on a guarantee, the depositor or guarantor must be informed in writing of the breach and the possible forfeiture or enforcement action, and be granted an opportunity for written representation. 
 
 
 
 " 
 The manager will determine whether it is appropriate to settle for an amount less than that originally stipulated in a guarantee on a case-by-case basis, according to regional guidelines.
