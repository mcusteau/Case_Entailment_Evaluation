  The TSB not only implemented Dr. Collins' recommendations, but exceeded them by granting the applicant six hours over two days to write the exam and the opportunity to take a 10 minute break every 50 minutes if required. The applicant was informed of the proposed accommodations in a letter dated September 15, 2000 and given until September 30 to comment upon them. On September 29, the applicant sent an e-mail to the TSB in which he reluctantly accepted the accommodations offered to him.
