 [23] 
  The right of appeal in section 21 exists to prevent appointments that are contrary to the merit principle. An Appeal Board is charged with determining whether a particular selection process was conducted in accordance with the merit principle. See  
 Charest v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1973] F.C. 1217 (F.C.A.), at p. 1221, where the Court stated that the purpose of a right of appeal under section 21 is not to protect the appellant's rights, but to prevent an appointment being made contrary to the merit principle.
