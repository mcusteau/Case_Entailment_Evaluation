  The Appeal Board Chairperson characterized the communications between the TSB and Dr. Collins in the following way at para. 42 of his decision: 
 
 
 
 "Once the Board has (sic) revised the written exam, it was sent to Dr. Collins who was asked to provide her 'professional opinion on the nature and extent of the appellant's symptoms, as they impact on his ability to undergo the (written exam) in question', and for her 'recommendations as to the testing accommodations which would allow him to be evaluated fairly on the (written test)'. In my view, it is apparent that an unfortunate mis-communication took place between the Board, the PPC and Dr. Collins in their first attempt at examining the matter. At the appeal hearing, I found the testimony of the persons involved in those discussions to be candid, forthright, and credible about the difficulties they encountered. In the end, Dr. Collins did reach a conclusion (as an expert in her field) that the proposed written exam could be administered to the appellant if testing conditions were altered to accommodate his condition, and she then formulated specific recommendations to that effect." 
 
 
 
 He went on to conclude at para. 44 of his decision: 
 
 
 
 "Based on the expert evidence presented, I find the written exam that had been developed was an objective and appropriate method for assessing the appellant and that it could be administered to the appellant with the modified testing conditions defined by Dr. Collins. Therefore, the written exam conformed to the Commission's  
 Standards for Selection and Assessment and the Guidelines for Assessing Persons with Disabilities
