  The applicant appealed the decision under section 21 of the  
 PSEA 
 . In a decision dated March 10, 2000, Appeal Board Chairperson John A. Mooney allowed the appeal. He found that the TSB had failed to properly accommodate the applicant's condition despite allowing him twice the time to complete the examination. The TSB had not sought advice from an occupational testing consultant, a physician or other expert and did not truly know what an adequate accommodation would entail. Further, the department had only informed the applicant of the measures taken on the eve of the examination, which did not allow him sufficient time to assess the adequacy of the accommodations.
