 Kelen, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review of a decision made by an Appeal Board of the Public Service Commission of Canada (the "PSC") appointed pursuant to section 21 of the  
 Public Service Employment Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. P-33 (the " 
 PSEA 
 "). This case, along with the related case in docket T-1958-00, concern section 10 of the  
 PSEA 
 , which requires appointments to and from within the public service to be based on selection according to merit. Both dockets raise the difficult issue of what steps a government department is required to take to accommodate the needs of a disabled candidate while ensuring that other candidates involved are not placed at a disadvantage.
