  A revised written exam was developed between late June and early July of 2000 under the direction of Mr. Greg Hunter, a Director General with the TSB. At the hearing of this appeal, he testified the exam was carefully reviewed and rewritten several times to improve its visual presentation, minimize demands of physical dexterity and to ensure that none of the questions contained any ambiguity. The amount of time given to complete the revised exam was set at 1.5 hours.
