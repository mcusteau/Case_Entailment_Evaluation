  The PPC's Chief of Test Consultation, Mr. Gilles Larose, wrote to Dr. Collins on August 22, 2000 and informed her that the PPC had serious reservations about her recommendations. He stated that the work trial model was not an acceptable method for evaluating candidates in the context of a competitive process in the federal public service. In his view, a take-home examination was also not acceptable because the candidates had to be evaluated in a controlled context. Moreover, as this was a re-assessment after an upheld appeal, Mr. Larose felt it was essential the evaluation method provide for answers that were open to as little interpretation as possible. Mr. Larose requested that Dr. Collins provide a re-assessment addressing the time and other administrative requirements appropriate for the applicant.
