  The final decision on what accommodations were appropriate in the case at bar lay with the TSB. While Dr. Collins focused solely on accommodating the needs of the applicant, the TSB had to also consider what effect the use of an alternative assessment method would have on the other candidates. As such, the TSB was not bound to follow the recommendations of Dr. Collins. In his letter to Dr. Collins dated August 22, 2000, Mr. Larose identified a number of legitimate concerns the TSB and the PPC had regarding the use of the assessment methods she initially recommended. Most notable among those mentioned by Mr. Larose was the need to conduct the evaluation in a controlled context and for an examination that provided answers that were open to as little interpretation as possible. The latter concern was particularly relevant as the TSB was conducting a re-assessment of candidates who had already been through the selection process prior to the applicant's successful appeal.
