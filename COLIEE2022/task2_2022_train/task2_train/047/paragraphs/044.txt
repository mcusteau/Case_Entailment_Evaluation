  Initially, the applicant only had a copy of a summary of the Krupp report and that was accepted as evidence by the Appeal Board Chairperson. The applicant later obtained a copy of the full report and attempted to enter it into evidence during the parties' final submissions. The TSB representative objected, stating that it was "kind of late in the game" for its introduction. The Appeal Board Chairperson refused to enter the Krupp report as evidence. He stated (at p. 95 of the Transcript): 
 
 
 
 "Gohier: I'm not inclined to accept the report [Krupp report] at this late stage. I am going to look at the summary of the report you provided; there is certain information that can be gleemed (sic) from the summary. I don't think the entire report is necessary ... I don't think it will clear anything up from my reading of the summary."
