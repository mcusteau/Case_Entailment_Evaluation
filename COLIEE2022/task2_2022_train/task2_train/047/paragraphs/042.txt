 [42] 
  A candidate who is suffering hardship related to noise has the burden of bringing that hardship to the attention of the selection board, see  
 Cyr et al. v. Canada (Procureur général) 
  (2000), 201 F.T.R. 191; 2002 FCA 68 (T.D.). The applicant did not bring the existence of this distraction to the attention of the selection board until the time of the appeal hearing. He should have raised the problems he was encountering with the test administrator. The TSB had already addressed an earlier problem relating to noise and there is no reason to think that they would not have done so again.
