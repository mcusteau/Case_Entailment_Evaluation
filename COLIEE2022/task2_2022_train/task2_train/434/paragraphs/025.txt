In order to implement the objective specified in section 3(a)(ii), Part 2 of the
PCMLTFA
provides for a currency reporting regime whereby importers and exporters of currency must make a report to a Customs official whenever they import or export large quantities of currency or monetary instruments into or out of Canada. My colleague Justice Layden-Stevenson very aptly set out the objectives and mechanics of the regime in
Dokaj v. Minister of National Revenue
(2005), 282 F.T.R. 121; 2005 FC 1437 (
Dokaj
), and I need not repeat that overview here. For ease of understanding, however, I will briefly highlight the most relevant provisions of that legislative scheme in the following paragraphs. These provisions can be found attached to these reasons as Schedule "A".
