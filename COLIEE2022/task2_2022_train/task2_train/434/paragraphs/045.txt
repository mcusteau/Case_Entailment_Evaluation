Mrs. Zeid pretends she was not paying attention when the Custom official asked questions to her son. Again, this claim is most difficult to believe, especially after having just been refused entry to the United States. How could she not be interested by what was going on? In any event, she must have heard what the Custom official was saying as she handed her driving license to her son when asked for identification of the passenger. How could she then not hear the Custom official asking if any of them had purchased anything from the Canadian duty free store, if either of them had any commercial or business goods, or if either of them had any currency or monetary instruments valued at over $10,000.00? This affidavit evidence given by the Custom official was not challenged by way of cross-examination.
