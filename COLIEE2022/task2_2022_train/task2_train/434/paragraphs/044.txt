The exhibits attached to the partial agreed statement of facts show that the sign posted at the Canadian border crossing advising travellers entering or leaving Canada with more than $10,000.00 that they have to report it is quite visible and is located right beside the booth where the Custom official proceeds to the primary check while travellers remain in their car. I find it hard to believe that the plaintiff would not have seen it.
