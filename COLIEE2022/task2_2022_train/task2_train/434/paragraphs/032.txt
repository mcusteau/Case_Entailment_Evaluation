If a request for a decision is made by a person entitled thereto pursuant to section 25 of the
PCMLTFA
, the President of the Canada Border Services Agency is obliged to serve that person with written notice of the circumstances of the seizure pursuant to subsection 26(1) of the
PCMLTFA
. That person is then entitled, pursuant to subsection 26(2) of the
PCMLTFA
, to provide any evidence in the matter that he or she desires to furnish, provided he or she does so within 30 days of receiving the Commissioner's written notice. The Minister must then, pursuant to section 27 of the
PCMLTFA
, make a decision with respect to whether subsection 12(1) of the
PCMLTFA
was contravened. This decision of the Minister can be termed "the section 27 Decision".
