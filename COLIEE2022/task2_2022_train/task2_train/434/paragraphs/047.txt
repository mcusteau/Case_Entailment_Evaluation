Mrs. Zeid and her son were then directed to report to the office. It was then decided to frisk both of them for the safety of the officials. When her purse was searched for possible weapons, $2,500.00 was found in the side pocket. At that point, Mrs. Zeid was asked if she had any other money in the vehicle, in her purse or on her before the search was continued, to which she stated "No". This is the affidavit evidence of three Custom officials who were present in the interview room where all this happened, and as already mentioned they were not cross-examined by the plaintiff. Indeed, she signed the partial agreed statement of facts, paragraph 8 of which (paragraph 11 of these reasons) confirms this version of the events.
