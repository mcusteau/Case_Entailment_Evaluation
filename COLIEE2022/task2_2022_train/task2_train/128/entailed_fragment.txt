The final point on this issue which must be addressed is the Respondent's attempt to introduce an affidavit from the Second PRRA Officer. I cannot accept this evidence, at least with respect to explanations of how he approached the file, and what evidence he looked at in making his two PRRA Addendum decisions. To do so would amount to an effort to "remedy a defect in the decision by filing further and better reasons in the form of an affidavit"
