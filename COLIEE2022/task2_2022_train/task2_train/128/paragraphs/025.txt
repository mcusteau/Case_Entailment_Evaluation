 [25] 
  I can accept that the Officer explains in his affidavit why he accepted the Applicant worked in the position of relationship manager. I can also accept that the Officer referenced the Applicant's principal documents, the Letter of Offer of August 1, 2008 and the Role Specification dated November 9, 2009, by indicating those dates in the decision letter. However, neither the Officer's letter nor the accompanying CAIPS notes make any reference whatsoever to the additional documentation supporting the Applicant's claim that he had worked for Lloyds TSB after November 9, 2009. This documentation is now listed in the Officer's affidavit being: 
 
 
 
 • Mr. Barboza's Employment Contract dated March 25, 2010 for the position of banking operations manager. 
 
 
 
 • Letter dated June 2010 from Vivek Vohra, Head of Corporate Banking, Lloyds TSB, Middle East congratulating Mr. Barboza on achieving 15 years with the Lloyds TSB group. 
 
 
 
 • A Length of Service Certificate recognizing Mr. Barboza's employment with Lloyds TSB Middle East for 15 years. This certificate is dated June 14, 2010. 
 
 
 
 • Corporate Banking Payslip dated September 2010.
