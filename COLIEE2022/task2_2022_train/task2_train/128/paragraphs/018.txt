 [18] 
  The Applicant essentially raises fives issues between both his Memorandum of Fact and Law and the Applicant's Further Memorandum of Argument. Combining the two, the Applicant frames the issues as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the Officer err in his assessment of the Applicant's work experience? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Officer err in his assessment of the Applicant's Spouse's education credential? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the Officer err by assessing the merits of an incomplete package contrary to sections 10 and 12 of the  
 Regulations 
 ? 
 
 
 
 4. Did the Officer err by not considering the Application after the refusal in light of the evidence that was already on file and the Applicant's further documents? 
 
 
 
 5. Did the Officer err by failing to provide the Applicant an opportunity to respond to the Officer's concerns?
