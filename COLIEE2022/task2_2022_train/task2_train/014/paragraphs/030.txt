  It is settled law that findings related to foreign law must be considered as questions of fact; therefore, an error in the interpretation of foreign law must be palpable for the Court to intervene. It seems to me this is the case here. In attributing Djiboutian nationality to the applicant on the basis of which clan her father belonged to and his nationality (which, besides, was not established with certainty), the Board clearly erred. This error had an impact, such that it undermined the applicant's credibility and coloured the assessment of the testimonies. If the applicant is not Djiboutian, contrary to what the Board concluded, there is nothing to indicate she is not Somali. The relevant legislation of this country (Law No. 28 of December 1962 - Somali Citizenship, article 3) stipulates that any person who by origin, language or tradition belongs to the Somali nation is considered a Somali. The onus was on the Minister to demonstrate that the applicant could not avail herself of this provision.
