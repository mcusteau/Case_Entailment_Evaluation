  The most serious error is clearly the fact that the Board found that Djiboutian nationality is determined from the father's nationality and membership in a clan. According to Djiboutian legislation (Loi No. 222/AN/1981 portant code de la nationalit√© djiboutienne), Djiboutian nationality is not determined solely by the father's nationality. A child born in or out of wedlock to father and mother who are Djiboutian (section 8), a child born in the Republic of Djibouti of unknown parents and a child born in the Republic of Djibouti of a Djiboutian mother, but whose father is unknown (section 9), are Djiboutian. Clan and ethnicity are not relevant in the least.
