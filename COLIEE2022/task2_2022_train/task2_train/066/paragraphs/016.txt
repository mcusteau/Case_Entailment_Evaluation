  On this point I determine that the decision of Martineau J. is applicable in the case at bar as regards the exercise of the Minister's discretion. On the legal basis of whether the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration had the authority to delegate responsibility to an officer who might ultimately have been responsible to the CBSA, the Minister's authority to delegate is clear and was exercised in an entirely legal manner in the case at bar.
