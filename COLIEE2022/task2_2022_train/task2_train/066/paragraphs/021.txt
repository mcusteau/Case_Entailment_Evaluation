  As suggested by counsel for the respondent, the grounds of an apprehension as to the tribunal's impartiality must be serious. In Arthur v. Canada (Attorney General) (2001), 283 N.R. 346, (F.C.A.), at paragraph 8, the Federal Court of Appeal noted that a serious allegation "challenges the integrity of the tribunal and of its members who participated in the impugned decision. It cannot be done lightly. It cannot rest on mere suspicion, pure conjecture, insinuations or mere impressions of an applicant or his counsel. It must be supported by material evidence demonstrating conduct that derogates from the standard".
