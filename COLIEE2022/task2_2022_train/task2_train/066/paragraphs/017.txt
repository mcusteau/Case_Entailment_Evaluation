  Counsel for the applicant suggested that there was a reasonable apprehension of bias in this case. When a party raises this, the existing case law states that it should be raised at the first possible opportunity and that clear and precise grounds must be established: in order to support a finding that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists, it is not simply a matter of stating that the same officer can make decisions in various areas at the same time. The applicant did not provide any factual support to show that such an apprehension could exist in the case at bar. The PRRA decision and the decision on humanitarian and compassionate grounds are two different and separate decisions and the applicant did not establish that any evidence existed that would justify a reasonable apprehension of bias.
