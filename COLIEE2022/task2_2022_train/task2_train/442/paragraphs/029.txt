The Commission argues that section 41(1)(e) of the
Act
grants a broad discretion in deciding whether to deal with a complaint when more than a year has passed from the occurrence of an alleged discriminatory act. The Commission submits that the standard of review for such a discretionary decision is patent unreasonableness. In this regard, the Commission relies on
Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paper Workers Union of Canada et al.
, [1999] 1 F.C. 113; 233 N.R. 87, at 136-137 (F.C.A.); application for leave to appeal to S.C.C. dismissed, [1999] S.C.C.A. No. 1; 243 N.R. 397 (S.C.C.).
