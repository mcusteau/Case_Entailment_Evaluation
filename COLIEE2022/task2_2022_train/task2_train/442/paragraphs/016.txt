By letter dated May 9, 2001, the Commission advised the Applicant that it had decided, pursuant to section 41(1) of the
Act
, not to deal with the complaint. That letter read as follows:
"I am writing to inform you of the decision taken by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in your complaint against Concord Transportation Inc. (20000186).
Before rendering their decision, the members of the Commission reviewed the report disclosed to you previously and any submission(s) filed in response to the report. After examining this information, the Commission decided, pursuant to paragraph 41(1) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, not to deal with the complaint because:
the alleged discriminatory act took place in June 1997 but the complainant did not contact the Commission until October 1998 even though she was aware of all the information in the complaint form in May 1998; and
the respondent would be prejudiced by the complainant's delay in filing the complaint due to lack of documentation and the possible failure of witnesses to recall the events in question
.
The Commission realizes that this is not the outcome you were hoping for. I can assure you, however, that the Commissioners examined your complaint very carefully before arriving at this decision.
For your information, either party to a complaint can ask the Federal Court, Trial Division, to review a Commission decision under section 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
. The application to the Court must normally be filed within 30 days of receipt of the Commission's decision." (Italics in original)
