In its response to these further submissions by the Applicant, the Respondent disputed the Applicant's contention that the alleged discriminatory act occurred in May 1998 and said that the date for the alleged discrimination was August 1997. Further, the Respondent argued that there was no evidence to show that any discrimination on the basis of sex occurred at that time when Steve Love was rejected as a driver by the Respondent. The Respondent maintained its position that the Commission should not proceed further with the Applicant's complaint.
