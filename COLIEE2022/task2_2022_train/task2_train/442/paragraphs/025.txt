The Respondent further argues that the Commission's decision concerning prejudice to it, if the complaint were allowed to proceed, was a finding of fact made in the exercise of its discretion. As such, the reviewing court should consider whether the discretion was exercised in good faith, in accordance with natural justice and procedural fairness, and without regard to irrelevant or extraneous considerations. In this regard, the Respondent relies on
Cape Breton Development Corp. v. Hynes
, [1999] 164 F.T.R. 32 (T.D.), and
Holmes v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.
(1999), 242 N.R. 148 (F.C.A.).
