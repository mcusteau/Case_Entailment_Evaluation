In my opinion, the Commission's conclusion as to the date of the alleged discriminatory act was reasonably supported by the evidence before it, including the Investigation Report and the submissions made by both parties. There is no evidence, on the record that the Commission acted in the absence of good faith, without regard to procedural fairness or relied on improper or irrelevant considerations.
