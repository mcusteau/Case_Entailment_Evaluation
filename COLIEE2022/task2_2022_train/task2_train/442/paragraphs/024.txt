As for the substantive argument, the Respondent focuses on the issue of the standard of review that should apply to the Commission's decision. It submits that in this case, where the Commission made a finding of fact concerning the date of the alleged discrimination, its decision should be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness. On that basis, the Respondent says that the Court should only interfere if the finding of fact made by the Commission that the alleged discrimination occurred in June 1997, cannot be reasonably supported by the evidence.
