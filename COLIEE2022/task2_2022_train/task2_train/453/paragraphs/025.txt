Mr. Kim's PIF dated July 16, 2002 recounts how the family came to Canadaand the reasons why they wanted to remain here, in particular to access educational opportunities for the children. He wanted his children to learn more creatively and to be exposed to different ways of thinking rather than from simply memorizing the textbook. He says that his children had successfully adapted to the educational system in Canada and that his son in particular, who was just 9 years old when they came here, would find it difficult to adjust to the Korean educational system. Mr. Kim refers to his own difficulties in finding employment in Korea and says he would find it hard to begin again. The IRB decision found that his evidence was credible and candid about his economic prospects.
