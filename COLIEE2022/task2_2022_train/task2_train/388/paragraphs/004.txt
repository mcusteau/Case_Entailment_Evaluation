The adjudicator concluded that the respondent was terminated, not laid off because of a lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function. Accordingly, the burden shifted to the employer to establish just cause for dismissal, which counsel for AECL admitted did not exist (AECL had only argued that there was a discontinuance of the respondent's job). The adjudicator further stated that the decision by Mr. Seddon, the manager of the department from which the respondent was dismissed, not to employ the respondent in alternative positions which were created was not informed, rational, and free of arbitrariness, given that three other employees were hired. Bolstering his decision, the adjudicator further concluded that AECL failed to notify the claimant of job openings after his termination.
