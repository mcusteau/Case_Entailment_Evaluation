It is my conclusion that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction since the undisputed evidence of all of the witnesses was that the respondent's position with AECL had been eliminated through corporate reorganization. There was the discontinuance of the respondent's function and the adjudicator had no power to consider the merits of the dismissal, as prohibited by para. 242(3.1)(a) of the
Canada Labour Code
. I note that my conclusion as to the discontinuance of a function and the lack of jurisdiction for an adjudicator was shared by two other adjudicators, considering the cases of two other employees dismissed by AECL in the same time frame as the respondent:
Fenning v. AECL
(November 24, 1994, Adj. Taylor) and
Ellila v. AECL
(June 30, 1995, Adj. Suche).
