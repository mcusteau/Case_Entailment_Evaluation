The respondent raised the question of costs. Although the respondent is clearly not entitled to costs since I am allowing this application, I note that I would not have awarded costs in any event. Rule 1618 of the
Federal Court Rules
makes clear that costs will be awarded only if "special reasons" exist. Despite the delay between the time of the arbitrator's decision and the judicial review hearing, there is nothing to indicate that the applicant purposely delayed matters or otherwise acted in bad faith.
