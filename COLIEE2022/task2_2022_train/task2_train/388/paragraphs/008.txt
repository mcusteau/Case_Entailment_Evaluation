In my view, the adjudicator did not properly consider what "discontinuance of a function" means. This phrase was discussed by Cory, J., writing for the majority, in
Flieger v. New Brunswick
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 651; 155 N.R. 1; 138 N.B.R.(2d) 161; 354 A.P.R. 161; 104 D.L.R.(4th) 292; 48 C.C.E.L. 1 (S.C.C.) at pp. 13-14 [C.C.E.L.]:
"... 'discontinuance of a function' will occur when that set of activities which form an office is no longer carried out as a result of a decision of an employer acting in good faith. For example, if a particular set of activities is merely handed over in its entirety to another person, or, if the activity or duty is simply given a new and different title so as to fit another job description then there would be no 'discontinuance of a function'. On the other hand, if the activities that form part of the set or bundle are divided among other people such as occurred in
Mudarth
, supra, there would be a 'discontinuance of function'. Similarly, if the responsibilities are decentralized, as happened in
Coulomb
e
, supra, there would also be a 'discontinuance of a function'."
The adjudicator, in the case at bar, seems to imply that because the respondent's department was profitable or expanding, the respondent's job was not discontinued. As
Flieger
demonstrates, however, "discontinuance of a function" can also arise if the activities that form part of the set or bundle, formerly performed by one employee, are divided among other people. The evidence, in my view, shows that this is exactly what happened in the case at bar.
