I agree with the applicant's submissions. There was simply no evidence before the adjudicator that AECL had dismissed the respondent for any reason other than the fact that it had gone through massive reorganization and his position was discontinued. The adjudicator acknowledged that AECL pared down the number of departments and eliminated 25 jobs although, in the end, only eight of the 25 employees whose jobs were eliminated were actually let go. The adjudicator, nonetheless, found that the respondent's position, while renamed, was not actually eliminated. Respectfully, I cannot agree. The department in which the respondent worked was re-organized. His position was eliminated. Granted, some of his job functions were split up and allocated to others within the department, but there is no question that the respondent's job was gone.
