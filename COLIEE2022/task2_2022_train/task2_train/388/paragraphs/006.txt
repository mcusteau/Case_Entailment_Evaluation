The thrust of the applicant's submissions is that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction. Section 242(3) of the
Canada Labour Code
allows an adjudicator to determine whether the dismissal of an employee was unjust. However, s. 242(3.1)(a) qualifies the adjudicator's power when an employee is terminated through corporate reorganization. It provides:
"242(3.1) No complaint shall be considered by an adjudicator under subs. (3) in respect of a person where
(a) that person has been laid off because of a lack of work or because of the discontinuance of a function."
The applicant submits that the adjudicator exceeded his jurisdiction and that Mr. Jindal was terminated because of a reorganization at AECL; consequently, there were no grounds upon which the adjudicator could consider whether the termination was unjust or otherwise unwarranted.
