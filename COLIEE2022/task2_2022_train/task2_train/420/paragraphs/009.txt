When the decision in
Premier Mouton
was rendered, the predecessor provision to what is now s. 68 was s. 46(6), R.S.C. 1952, c. 100:
"46(6) If any person, whether by mistake of law or fact, has paid or overpaid to His Majesty, any moneys which have been taken to account, as taxes imposed by this Act, such moneys shall not be refunded unless application has been made in writing within two years after such moneys were paid or overpaid."
The issue was whether the two-year limitation period under s. 46(6) was applicable. The majority of the Supreme Court of Canada found it was not. It held that Premier Mouton Products Inc. had not been mistaken as to the law. It found that the company's real reasons for paying were that its officers had been intimidated and threatened by officers of the department and for fear of having its business closed up. As a result, the two-year limitation period for claiming refunds of excise tax under s. 46(6) of the
Excise Tax Act
was found not to apply.
