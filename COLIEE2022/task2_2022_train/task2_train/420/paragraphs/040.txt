The plaintiff has unnecessarily paid sales tax (according to the
Pick-a-Mix
decision) on the transportation cost component of its selling price of concrete. Not only did it pay tax for which it was not liable, but because its pre-mix concrete competitors had not been charged sales tax on transportation costs, it was rendered less competitive in its marketplace and therefore may have lost sales. In a case such as this, a court is strongly inclined to try to interpret the law to avoid an inequitable result. However, the court is bound by the statute. The law is written for general application and there may be cases in which the result of the application of the law may be harsh. That is the situation here. During the course of argument, I discussed various alternative approaches with counsel for both parties but I have been unable to discover any approach that would yield a favourable result to the plaintiff.
