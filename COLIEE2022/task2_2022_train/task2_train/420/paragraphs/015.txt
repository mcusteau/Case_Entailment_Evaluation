In any event, as I have said, a letter of protest generally has limited legal significance as to whether tax is paid under a mistake of law. The issue is whether the tax is paid voluntarily. In
Premier Mouton
, duress was the most important consideration in determining whether the tax had been paid voluntarily. Protest was of little significance. The judgment of Taschereau, J., seems to be the clearest on this point. At p. 369, he holds that:
"... the mere fact that the payment was made 'under protest' is not conclusive but, when all the circumstances of the case are considered, it flows that the respondent clearly intended to keep alive its right to recover the sum paid."
Paraphrasing Lord Reading in the well-known case
Maskell v. Horner
, [1915] 3 K.B. 106 (C.A.), Taschereau, J., states:
"... I am satisfied that the payments made were not prompted by the desire to discharge a legal obligation, or to settle definitely a contested claim. The pressure that was exercised is sufficient, I think, to negative the expression of the free will of the respondent's officers, with the result that the alleged agreement to pay the tax has no legal effect and may be avoided. The payment was not made voluntarily to close the transaction. ... [T]he payment was made for the purpose of averting the threatened evil, and not with the intention of giving up a right, but with the intention of preserving the right to dispute the legality of the demand. The threats and the payments made under protest support this contention of the respondent."
