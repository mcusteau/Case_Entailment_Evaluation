Counsel claims that because the plaintiff paid under protest, as a result of its May 26, 1988 letter, it did not pay under a mistake, and therefore the limitation period in s. 68 is not applicable. In support of this proposition counsel relies on
Canada v. Premier
Mouton Products Inc.
, [1961] S.C.R. 361, which, as he noted, was not discussed in
474245 Ontario Limited
. In
Premier
Mouton
, the taxpayer paid excise tax on the "mouton" it produced from 1950 to 1952. Mouton was made from sheepskins. The tax was charged under a statutory provision pertaining to fur. In another case, decided in June 1956, the Supreme Court of Canada determined that sheepskin could not be described as a fur and that no excise tax was therefore payable. In October 1957, Premier Mouton Products Inc. commenced proceedings to recover the excise tax it had earlier paid. This case was argued before the Supreme Court of Canada in 1960. A decision was rendered in 1961.
