Once a person makes the application envisaged by s. 68, the Minister
must
consider it, and either accept or reject it in whole or in part; see s. 72(6). If the Minister fails to make a determination, the applicant could presumably force the Minister to do so through mandamus. If the Minister accepts the application, the matter would seem to be concluded. However, if it is rejected, the applicant has available to it the review and appeal procedures to which I have referred.
