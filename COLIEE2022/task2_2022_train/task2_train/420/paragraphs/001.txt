Rothstein, J.
: In this proceeding, the plaintiff seeks a refund of federal sales tax paid between August 1, 1985 and December 31, 1990. The defendant allowed a refund of that portion of the tax paid after September 25, 1988. With respect to the plaintiff's claim for refund of the tax paid before that date, the issue is whether the limitation period in s. 68 of the
Excise Tax Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15, is applicable.
