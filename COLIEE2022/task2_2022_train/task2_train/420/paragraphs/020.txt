An early statement on the voluntariness of tax payments was made by Macdonald, J.A., in
Vancouver Growers Ltd. v. Snow Ltd.
, [1937] 4 D.L.R. 128 (B.C.C.A.). Generally, he was of the view that merely because a statute compels compliance with its terms and imposes penalties, or that government officials are in a superior position to the individual, does not negate the assumption that all citizens voluntarily discharge obligations involving payments of monies compelled by statute. At pp. 131 and 132 he states:
"If payments made pursuant to an invalidated Act are to be regarded as made involuntarily because presumably the parties making the payments were not on equal terms with the authority purporting to act under the statute it may be difficult to procure officials willing to assume the necessary risk. A declaration of invalidity may be made after many years of operation and large amounts might be recoverable if it is enough to show in a literal sense that 'the payments were made under circumstances which left the party no choice' or that 'the plaintiff really had no choice and the parties ... were not on equal terms'. Every Act for taxation or other purposes, whether valid in fact, or for the time being thought to be valid, compels compliance with its terms under suitable penalties. The payee has no choice and the authorities imposing it are in a superior position. It does not follow, however, that all who comply do so under compulsion, except in the sense that every Act imposes obligations, or that the respective parties in the truest sense are not 'on equal terms'. It should be assumed that all citizens voluntarily discharge obligations involving payments of money or other duties imposed by statute."
