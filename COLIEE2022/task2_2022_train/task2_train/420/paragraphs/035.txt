It was open to the plaintiff to follow the procedure prescribed in the
Excise Tax Act.
However, it only sent a letter of protest on May 26, 1988. Instead of sending this letter, had the plaintiff sent in an application for refund in the prescribed form, and followed the review and appeal procedures in the
Act
, it may well have obtained a refund extending back, if not to August 1, 1985, then to May 26, 1986. An extension back to May 26, 1986 would be predicated on a successful result to a proper claim for refund. In other words, had Riverside made its refund application on May 26, 1988, followed the review and appeal procedures, and, like Pick-A-Mix, been successful at the CITT, it would have obtained a refund of the tax it paid, extending back two years before its claim.
