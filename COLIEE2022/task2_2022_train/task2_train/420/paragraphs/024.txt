[24]
In the case at bar, even if it could be construed that the plaintiff entertained some doubt as to its liability for the tax (which I have already explained I do not think is the case), at most its letter of protest is evidence that it did not want to pay the tax. But, the real question is whether the plaintiff had a choice as to whether or not to make the payment. Was it paid voluntarily or under duress? If there was a choice, the monies have not been paid under a mistake of law.
