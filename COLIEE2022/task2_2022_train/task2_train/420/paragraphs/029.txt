To the extent an argument could be made that between August 1, 1985 and April 30, 1986 the defendant could have enforced payment through extrajudicial means, such argument would not avail to the benefit of the plaintiff. The reason is that there is no evidence that during this period the defendant sought to implement extrajudicial sanctions. As indicated by Pannam, the mere existence of extrajudicial sanctions is insufficient to make a payment of tax compulsory in the absence of evidence of an intent to implement such sanctions.
