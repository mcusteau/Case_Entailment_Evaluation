In order to reach a conclusion on this issue, it is necessary to determine whether collection could only have been enforced through judicial proceedings or whether, as in
Premier Mouton
, the governmental authorities could have embarked and intended to embark upon extrajudicial sanctions against the plaintiff such that the collection was involuntary. I have concluded that as of May 1, 1986, collection could only have been enforced through judicial proceedings. Prior to May 1, 1986, it could be that collection through extrajudicial sanctions was possible but there is no evidence of an intention by the Minister to take such steps. Both before and after May 1, 1986, payment of tax by the plaintiff could not be characterized as involuntary.
