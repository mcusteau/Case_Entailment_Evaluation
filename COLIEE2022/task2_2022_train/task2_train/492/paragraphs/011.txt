In
Cius v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2008 FC 1, at para. 22, Beaudry J. concluded that, the standard of correctness was applicable when reviewing a decision regarding whether or not the perception of wealth constitutes a particularized risk under section 97. I agree. The interpretation of this provision is a question of pure law and thus will be afforded no deference.
