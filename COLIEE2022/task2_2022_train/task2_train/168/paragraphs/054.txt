  Humanitarian or personal factors are to be considered in a determination of whether cruel or unusual treatment will occur:  
 Canepa v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1992] 3 F.C. 270; 145 N.R. 121 (F.C.A.);  
 R. v. Goltz 
 , [1991] 3 S.C.R. 485; 131 N.R. 1; 5 B.C.A.C. 161; 11 W.A.C. 161. Mr. Kim argues that the circumstances of his life in Canada and other personal details should have been considered in the determination of whether he would be subjected to cruel or unusual treatment.
