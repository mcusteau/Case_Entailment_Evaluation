 [66] 
  The question of whether PRRA officers have an obligation to examine humanitarian and compassionate considerations if the person concerned so requests has not been squarely addressed in the jurisprudence of this Court. In a recent stay application in  
 Sowkey v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) et al. 
 , [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 343; 2004 FC 67, Justice Phelan found that this question met the low threshold to be accepted as a serious issue but made no further comment. I denied leave on the underlying PRRA application in that case.
