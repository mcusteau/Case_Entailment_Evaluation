  It would have been preferable, however, for the PRRA officer to address the statement reportedly made by the Prime Minister of Cambodia to the effect that deportees would be imprisoned. It was open to the officer to make a finding that was adverse to the applicant (for instance, that there was no evidence that this was anything more than a politically motivated statement or that in practice this statement had proven to be false), but not to ignore the evidence completely. However, given the contrary evidence, which points to the conclusion that deportees are not generally mistreated or imprisoned, I do not see how this omission could have changed the outcome in the PRRA decision.
