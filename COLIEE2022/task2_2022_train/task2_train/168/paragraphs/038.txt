  Yet there was never a requirement for members of this class to have been persecuted for a Convention reason or otherwise, so recognition of the class as a whole as refugees would have designated many people as refugees who had no factual basis for inclusion in the definition. Many of the members of this class would undoubtedly have qualified as refugees, but the Indochinese Designated Class provided a safer and easier way for them to enter Canada. There are almost certainly members of the former Indochinese Designated Class who would suffer persecution or s. 97 risks if returned to their countries of origin, even today - but the PRRA assessment is designed to prevent such an eventuality. I do not find that Parliament inadvertently omitted to include the Indochinese Designated Class members in the  
 Humanitarian Designated Class Regulations 
  or in the definition of protected persons.
