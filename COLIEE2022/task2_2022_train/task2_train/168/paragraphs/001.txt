 Mosley, J. 
 : Mr. Rith Kim is a 33-year-old Cambodian national who arrived in Canada at the age of 12. He has never been declared a refugee in Canada, but the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ("UNHCR") accepted him as a mandate refugee. His family resettled here in 1984 as permanent residents, having been selected under the Indochinese Designated Class, a program in existence from 1978 to 1997 to aid in the resettlement of south-east Asian "boat people" fleeing strife in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. Mr. Kim has never received Canadian citizenship.
