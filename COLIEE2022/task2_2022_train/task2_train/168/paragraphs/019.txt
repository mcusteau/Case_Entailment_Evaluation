  In  
 Tekie v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 25; 2005 FC 27, at para. 6, Justice Phelan found: 
 
 
 
 "The standard of review of credibility findings, which is at the heart of this PRRA decision, is patent unreasonableness. With respect to findings on specific facts, the  
 Federal Court Act 
  s. 18.1(4)(d) sets the standard as 'an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it'." 
 
 
 
 In  
 Figurado v. Canada (Solicitor General) 
  (2005), 262 F.T.R. 219; 2005 FC 347, at para. 51, Justice Martineau agreed that the standard of review for findings of fact by a PRRA officer is that found in paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended. Findings of fact are not to be made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the tribunal. This is equivalent to a standard of review of patent unreasonableness.
