  In most instances, a PRRA decision would take into account largely the same factors as are considered in a refugee determination. The purpose as a whole of the legislation in question is set out in s. 3 of  
 IRPA 
 ; the purpose of the PRRA assessment provisions as they relate to refugee determination are particularly addressed in s. 3(2): 
 
 
 
 "3(2) The objectives of this Act with respect to refugees are 
 
 
 
 (a) to recognize that the refugee program is in the first instance about saving lives and offering protection to the displaced and persecuted; 
 
 
 
 (b) to fulfil Canada's international legal obligations with respect to refugees and affirm Canada's commitment to international efforts to provide assistance to those in need of resettlement; 
 
 
 
 c) to grant, as a fundamental expression of Canada's humanitarian ideals, fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution; 
 
 
 
 (d) to offer safe haven to persons with a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group, as well as those at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment; 
 
 
 
 (e) to establish fair and efficient procedures that will maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system, while upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings; 
 
 
 
 (f) to support the self-sufficiency and the social and economic well-being of refugees by facilitating reunification with their family members in Canada; 
 
 
 
 (g) to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of Canadian society; and 
 
 
 
 (h) to promote international justice and security by denying access to Canadian territory to persons, including refugee claimants, who are security risks or serious criminals."
