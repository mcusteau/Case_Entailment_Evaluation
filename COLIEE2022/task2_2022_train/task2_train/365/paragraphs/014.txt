The Applicant referred me to the decision in Samani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 1178 (F.C.T.D.) where Hugessen J. indicated that "it is never particularly persuasive to say that an action is implausible simply because it may be dangerous for a politically committed person." This principle is important to understand, in combination with the reference to L. Waldman's Immigration Law and Practice in Blanchard J.'s decision in Divsalar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 875 at para. 24, where he states "actions which might appear implausible if judged by Canadian standards might be plausible when considered within the context of the claimant's background."
