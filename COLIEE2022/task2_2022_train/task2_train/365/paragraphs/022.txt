[22]
The Applicant alleges various reviewable errors as regards this aspect of the Decision. In my opinion, the material points are:
1. The Board concedes a possible sequence of events that are not, when taken individually, persecutory. Therefore, it cannot, at the same time, say that the Applicant should have had sufficient subjective fear to leave Iran earlier than he did;
2. Different people react to events in different ways; the Applicant's credibility cannot be questioned merely because he remained in Iran longer than someone might have done. It is entirely arbitrary for the Board to say the Applicant should have left sooner;
3. As regards the Applicant's military experience, there was no evidence before the Board that people are exempt from military service because they are indifferent to the regime. The Applicant's account cannot be held to be implausible unless there was evidence of the implausibility. The Boards cites no such evidence or reasons for such a finding.
