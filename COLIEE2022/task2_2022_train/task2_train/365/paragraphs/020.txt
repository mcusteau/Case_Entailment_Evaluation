A review of the Tribunal Record convinces me that the Respondent is correct in this regard. Although in its Decision the Board does appear to speculate somewhat, the main point is that the Board "finds the claimant's testimony unreliable and untrustworthy" and "fabricated and not credible" in relation to the bookstore incident. The Board does not articulate these credibility concerns as well as it might have done, but I believe there is sufficient explanation in the Decision on this point and that there is sufficient evidentiary basis in the form of inconsistencies in the Applicant's narrative to avoid a reviewable error. It may not have been the decision that I would have made on the evidence, but it is not perverse and it does not warrant interference by this court.
