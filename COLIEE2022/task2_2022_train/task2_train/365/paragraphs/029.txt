[29]
The jurisprudence of this Court establishes that where the Board finds a lack of credibility based on inferences, including inferences concerning the plausibility of the testimony, there must be a basis in the evidence to support the inferences. In my opinion, the Board in the case at bar fails to articulate a sufficient basis on the evidence for this key point. Behind the Board's conclusions in this regard lie a host of assumptions and speculations for which there is no real evidentiary basis. For the Board to have proceeded in this way was a reviewable error.
