The appropriate standard of review relating to findings of credibility is that of patent unreasonableness, as indicated by Snider J. in Ozo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 561 (F.C.T.D.):
10 The parties agreed that the appropriate standard of review is one of patent unreasonableness, which means that findings of credibility must be supported by the evidence and must not be made capriciously or based on erroneous findings of fact (Aguebor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 732 (C.A.) (Q.L.); Singh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1986] F.C.J. No. 514 (C.A.) (QL); Muhammed v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 815 (T.D.) (QL)).
11 Although this Court may be equally well-placed to assess the plausibility of the Applicant's claim in light of the documentary evidence, it is not the role of the Court to re-weigh the evidence before the Board and the burden is still on the Applicant to show that the Board's inferences could not have reasonably been drawn (Aguebor, supra). Even if this Court would have reached a different conclusion based on the evidence, the Board's decision should not be overturned unless it was perverse, capricious or made without regard to the evidence before it (Oduro v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 560 (T.D.) (QL); Tao v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 622 (T.D.) (QL); Grewal v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1983] F.C.J. No. 129 (C.A.) (Q.L.); Muhammed, supra).
