  Subsequent to the issuance of the CIRB decision, the Mint and PSAC entered into the MOU which expressly required the Mint to use its best efforts to lobby PWGSC to recognize the individual applicants' service during the Relevant Period as pensionable service. It is worthwhile to re-iterate that it was a representative of PSAC who actually first requested that PWGSC recognize the period within which the individual applicants were employed by Pro-Fac as "pensionable service" in accordance with the  
 PSSA 
 . In concluding the matter is not res judicata, I note it is illogical for the applicant PSAC to request such a provision in the MOU or to apply to PWGSC for recognition of the Relevant Period of time as  
 PSSA 
  "pensionable service", if the union were consistently of the opinion that the pension issue had already been determined in the CIRB decision.
