  At issue in the CIRB decision was the interaction between subsection 18(3) of the  
 RCMA 
  and the provisions of Part I- Industrial Relations of the  
 Code 
 . Subsection 18(3) states "No collective agreement entered into by the Mint with its employees pursuant to Part I of the  
 Canada Labour Code 
  shall prohibit or limit the power of the Mint to enter into contracts with any person to provide for the procurement by the Mint of any goods or services from that person or the minting of coins by that person." Subsection 3(1) of the  
 Code 
  defines an employee as "any person employed by an employer and includes a dependent contractor and a private constable, but does not include a person who performs management functions or is employed in a confidential capacity in matters relating to industrial relations." The term employer is defined in that same subsection of the  
 Code 
  as "(a) any person who employs one or more employees, and (b) in respect of a dependent contractor, such person as, in the opinion of the Board, has a relationship with the dependent contractor to such extent that the arrangement that governs the performance of services by the dependent contractor for that person can be the subject of collective bargaining."
