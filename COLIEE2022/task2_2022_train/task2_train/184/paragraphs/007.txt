  The Mint argued that subsection 18(3) gave it the right to enter into contracts with any individual irrespective of the provisions of the  
 Code 
 . More specifically, it was argued that this subsection should be applied in such a manner that contractors who enter into contracts with the Mint for the procurement of goods and services should not be regarded as "employees" under the  
 Code 
  and accordingly, should not be covered by the bargaining unit.
