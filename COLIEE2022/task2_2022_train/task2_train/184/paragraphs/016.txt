  At issue in  
 National Automobile, Aerospace 
  was whether  
 shift and weekend premiums payable under a collective agreement constitute a part of "salary" 
  as defined in subsection 3(1) of the  
 PSSA 
 . Justice Lemieux conducted a pragmatic and functional analysis. He agreed with counsel for the applicant that there is no privitive clause in the  
 PSSA 
 ; the question was a pure question of law; legal questions are not at the core of the PWGSC's expertise; and, that deciding the issue involved no element of discretion on the part of the pension administrators who do not carry out any policy or adjudicative functions. Much like in the case at bar, the respondent in National Automobile argued the standard of review should be reasonableness simpliciter due to the relative expertise of PWGSC and since the question was one of mixed fact and law. Rejecting the respondent's arguments, Justice Lemieux's concluded little deference is owed to the administrators of the  
 PSSA 
  and that the proper interpretation of the word "salary" contains a very minimal fact-finding component.
