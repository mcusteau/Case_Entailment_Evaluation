  I agree with my colleague that the standard of correctness is the proper standard to apply on the facts of the case he has to decide, which was solely an interpretation involving only a question of law. If the issue was only the applicability of the CIRB decision to the decision under the case at bar, being a question of law, the standard would have been correctness.
