Similarly, when the 1978 amendments were made to extend compensation to evaders, an identical clause was inserted into the Bill to make it effective as of April 1, 1976. There would have been no point in having a coming into force date prior to the giving of Royal Assent to these Bills if the intention were not to make the compensation payable as of April 1, 1976. Section 3 of the
Compensation for Former Prisoners of War Act
provided, as quoted above, that compensation was payable "on application to the Commission". The sense of those words was intended to mean that no legal entitlement to compensation arose prior to an application being made. As no application could be made prior to Royal Assent to the Bill, there was no point in making the Bill come into effect some weeks prior to when an application could be made unless it was the intent of Parliament that they were conferring monthly compensation on former prisoners of war payable effective April 1, 1976, subject only to a proper application being made and accepted as proof of entitlement to that compensation. There being no indications to the contrary in these
Acts
, I must assume in the total context that such was the intention.
