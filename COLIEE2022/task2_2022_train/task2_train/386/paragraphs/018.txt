I wish to emphasize that the language of s. 39(1) was not adopted as such in respect of prisoners of war and evaders compensation. It will be noted that s. 39(1), limiting as it does payments to the date of application, by its terms applies to "a pension awarded for disability". In my view, compensation for prisoners of war is not "a pension awarded for disability". Even in the provisions adopted in 1987 by way of amendments to the
Pension Act
specifically applying to these persons, the new s. 71.2(1) provides that "a prisoner of war is entitled, on application, to basic compensation." Such was the language of the 1976
Act
which also said that: "a prisoner of war ... is entitled on application to the Commission, to compensation. ..." As I have noted, the circumstances of the passage of the 1976
Act
and the provisions for a retroactive coming into force indicate that what was intended was that compensation be effective as of April 1, 1976. This was said to be payable "on application", as does s. 71.2(1) of the
Pension Act
. In the context of the 1976
Act
that expression "on application" made an authenticated application a condition precedent to receiving compensation, but the date of the application did not define the amount of compensation. Not only was that, I suggest, the intention of Parliament but it was the manner in which that
Act
was administered throughout its existence. It is true that s. 71.2(1) which states the entitlement to compensation commences with the words "subject to s. (4) ...". Subsection (4), quoted supra, does make s. 39 generally applicable to compensation for former prisoners of war. However, it is applicable "with any modifications that the circumstances require." In my view, circumstances require a different approach in the matter of entitlement to compensation for former prisoners of war and evaders.
