Mr. Reid never received any notice from the Department of Veterans Affairs that he was eligible for compensation as an evader. He happened to learn of it in the fall of 1999 from another ex-service man. He contacted the Department of Veterans Affairs and applied for compensation on November 23, 1999. Eventually, he was allowed benefits commencing November 18, 1999. He appealed the decision to limit his benefits to commencement only on the day of his application in 1999. His appeals were dismissed ending with the decision of the Board which is the subject of this judicial review.
