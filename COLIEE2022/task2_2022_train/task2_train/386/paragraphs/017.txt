When in 1987 the Government of the day decided to repeal the
Compensation for Former Prisoners of War Act
and to bring its compensation scheme within the
Pension Act
, the Minister expressed his pleasure "to introduce legislation to this House which would be a benefit to Canadian Veterans and their families". He stated in respect of his Bill:
"Bill C-100 ... will remove deficiencies that have been revealed within the existing legislation. We want our legislation to be fair and equitable to all veterans and their families, and Bill C-100 will erase injustices that have inadvertently been allowed to exist. ... All amendments, however, are designed to improve the existing legislation for veterans and their dependants." (

Nowhere in these remarks do I find a statement of intention to deny former prisoners of war and evaders who had not yet applied for compensation the equivalent of some 11 years of possible benefits. I think one must therefore view with some caution the position taken by the Attorney General of Canada that such was the purpose of the 1987 amendments and, in particular, the application of s. 39(1) of the
Pension Act
to the payment of compensation to former prisoners of war or evaders.
