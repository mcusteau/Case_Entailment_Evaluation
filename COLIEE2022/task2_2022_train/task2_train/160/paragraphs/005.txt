  The Board then examined the elements of the offence by considering the equivalent offence in the Canadian  
 Criminal Code 
  (which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, although the Board incorrectly stated the maximum penalty to be 10 years imprisonment), noted that the U.S. is a democratic country in which the applicant pled guilty before a judge, and considered the penalty and facts of the offence. With respect to aggravating and mitigating factors, the RPD held, in accordance with the case law, that consideration of what had happened since the offence (i.e. whether the applicant had been rehabilitated) and of his motives for committing the crime were irrelevant and that, rather, the mitigating and aggravating factors were limited to consideration of what happened during the commission of the offence and to the nature of the acts committed. On the basis of these facts, the Board concluded that the offence committed by the applicant was serious within the meaning of Article 1F(b) and thus found the applicant to be excluded from protection.
