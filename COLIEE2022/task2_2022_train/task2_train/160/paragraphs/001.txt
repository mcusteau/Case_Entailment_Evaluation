 Gleason, J. 
 : The applicants are citizens of Colombia. The male applicant, Juan Carlos Ospina Velasquez, [the applicant] initially applied for refugee protection along with his two children and his wife. His wife's claim was accepted and those of the children - who are US citizens - were rejected. Judicial review of the decision with respect to the children is no longer being pursued, and this decision therefore relates only to the applicant.
