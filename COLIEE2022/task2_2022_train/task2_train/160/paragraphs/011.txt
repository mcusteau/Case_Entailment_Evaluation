  Turning, then, to the arguments advanced by the applicant, in my view, the decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Febles 
  and  
 Feimi 
  foreclose the first argument. In short, the Court of Appeal's rulings definitively establish that the fact that the applicant was convicted many years ago, served his sentence, and has been a law-abiding citizen since, cannot serve as mitigating factors in the determination of whether he should be excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. Contrary to what the applicant asserts, these decisions bar reliance not only on rehabilitation generally, but also on the fact of a sentence having been served. In this regard, Justice Evans, writing for the Court on this point, stated at para 34 in  
 Febles 
 : 
 
 
 
 First, [this Court's decision in  
 Jayasekara v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 
  2008 FCA 404] explains why the length of a sentence is an unreliable guide to the seriousness of a crime, and hence is often of little value on assessing the seriousness of the crime. The completion of a sentence is not even mentioned in this discussion. Second, neither the length nor completion of a sentence is included in the factors [identified in  
 Jayasekara 
 ] that may rebut the presumption of seriousness arising from the maximum sentence that could be imposed if the crime had been committed in Canada. Third, to interpret  
 Jayasekara 
  as allowing members of the RPD the discretion to consider completion of a sentence would likely lead to a lack of consistency in RPD decision-making bordering on arbitrariness.
