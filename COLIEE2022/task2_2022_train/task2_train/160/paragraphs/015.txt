  Second, and more fundamentally, the Board is not bound to accept the position of a party in any case and, instead, is required to carry out its statutory duty of applying the IRPA. Under the Act, the RPD's role is an inquisitorial one (see e.g. Board Chairperson's Guideline 7 Concerning Preparation and Conduct of a Hearing in the Refugee Protection Division at ss 2.1 and 2.2).

Thus, the second argument advanced by the applicant is without merit.
