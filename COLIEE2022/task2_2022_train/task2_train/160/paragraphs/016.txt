  Finally, insofar as concerns the reasonableness of the Board's determination, contrary to what the applicant asserts, the RPD did not merely recite the facts and reach a conclusion without any analysis. Rather, the Board conducted a fairly detailed analysis. It first correctly canvassed the factors relevant to its analysis. These factors were outlined by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Jayasekara 
  at para 44, which the Board cited, and consist of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction. The Board then correctly held that it could not consider motive or rehabilitation (citing  
 Jayasekara 
  and  
 Diaz v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , IMM-4878-10). It then went on to consider each of the relevant factors in the applicant's case and concluded that his drug trafficking offense amounted to a serious crime for the purposes of Article 1F(b). It was not necessary for the Board to explain why it weighed the factors the way it did or to provide longer reasons. The decision reveals how and why it came to its conclusion, which is all that the reasonableness standard requires in terms of transparency and intelligibility of reasons ( 
 Construction Labour Relations v Driver Iron Inc 
 , 2012 SCC 65;  
 Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board) 
 , 2011 SCC 62).
