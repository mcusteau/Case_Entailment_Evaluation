  The Defendant, Maple Leaf Sports Entertainment Ltd. (MLSE), owns and operates the Air Canada Centre (ACC). In addition to the sports played at ACC, the facility is used for concerts and other entertainment. Most of the concerts are promoted by third parties who enter into agreements with MLSE. The nature, type and obligations flowing from these agreements, particularly in respect of the obligation to pay royalties, are an important element of this litigation.
