  Authorization and/or control are questions of mixed law and fact. They depend often on a matrix of factors which require detailed analysis. The factors address issues previously referred to in respect of s. 27(5) and s. 41(1) of the Act. This is but one instance where the complexity of the law and the facts are such that there is a genuine issue to be tried.
