  Rule 81 has been interpreted to permit exceptions on a principled basis. Rule 55 gives the Court that flexibility. It would be contrary to the intent of the summary judgment rules to preclude all hearsay evidence particularly where that evidence may be admissible at trial. To take an unduly restrictive view of the Court's Rule would create unintended mischief. A party could on a motion be deprived of the right to trial on an evidentiary technicality yet could have succeeded at a trial where hearsay is admissible. 
 
 
 
 Parts of SOCAN's case is dependent on hearsay evidence of what works were played because neither party has direct personal evidence on that point. It would be unjust on this motion to ignore that hearsay evidence or its existence and that it may be admissible at trial.
