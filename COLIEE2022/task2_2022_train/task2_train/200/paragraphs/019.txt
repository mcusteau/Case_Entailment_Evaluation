  The CAIPS notes indicate that the Visa Officer's reason for not accepting the spouse's certificate in respect of the Party School was the absence of Cadgedc certification, but silent on the effect of graduation certificates supplied from the Huaihai Communications Vocational College. The certifications provided with respect to the Huaihai Vocational School says nothing about accreditation, they simply confirm reenrollment. Again, there was no link between the document and the substantive issue to which section 73 of the  
 Regulations 
  is directed - namely the status, authority and accreditation of the institution providing the CADGEDC certification would have addressed the issue of accreditation of the institution granting the certificate. In my view, where the Officer was faced with no evidence addressing the regulatory requirement, he did not fetter his discretion by commenting on the type of evidence which, if tendered, would have met the requirement.
