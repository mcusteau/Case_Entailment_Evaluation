  The letter provided to the applicant by Citizenship & Immigration Canada (CIC) explaining the refusal of his application is of a boilerplate type; however, the Officer wrote in respect of the applicant's application: 
 
 
 
 I have now completed the assessment of your application for a permanent resident visa as a skilled worker. I have determined that you do not meet the requirements for immigration to Canada. 
 
 
 
 [...] 
 
 
 
 You have obtained insufficient points to qualify for immigration to Canada, the minimum requirement being 67 points: You have not obtained sufficient points to satisfy me that you will be able to become economically established in Canada. 
 
 
 
 [...] 
 
 
 
 Following an examination of your application, I am not satisfied that you meet the requirements of the Act and the regulations for the reasons explained above. I am therefore refusing your application.
