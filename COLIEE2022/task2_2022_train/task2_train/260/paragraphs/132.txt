Dr. Wentland's evidence is that a medicinal chemist working in the quinolone field subscribed to the induced-fit theory (over the lock and key theory), where the bacterial DNA gyrase target site would be flexible and able to recognize drugs of very diverse shapes. The practical result is that a medicinal chemist in the quinolone field did not believe a particular special orientation such as that of the methyl group to be so important. This is evident from the ability of the DNA gyrase enzyme
target
site to accommodate quinolones with substituents of different sizes, shapes and properties. (Wentland Affidavit at paras. 54-58, AR, v. 31, Tab 45, pp. 9876-9878.)
