Dr. Wentland's evidence is that quinolones have a long-standing reputation for being unpredictable if modified. A medicinal chemist in the 1982-85 time frame would know that one cannot make predictions with reasonable certainty where there are changes either to (1) the core structure or (2) the substitution pattern. Flumequine has
both
a different core structure and substitution pattern than ofloxacin. As a result, a skilled person in 1985 could not have predicted that the effects observed with flumequine would also be seen with ofloxacin.
"Despite all attempts to correlate the chemical structure of the new fluoroquinolones with activity and/or side effects, it seems likely that the optimum fluoroquinolone agent cannot be theoretically designed but has to be identified experimentally."
