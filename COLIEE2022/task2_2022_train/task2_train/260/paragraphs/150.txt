In the
Novopharm
Trial, Justice Hughes made the following statement in respect of toxicity:
"[16] Consideration must be given to the risks of toxicity in the administration of antimicrobial substances. Much evidence was presented at trial as to the measurement of antimicrobial activity and of toxicity and the balancing of antimicrobial activity on the one hand and toxic effects on the other in administering various dosage levels of these substances. A drug must be effective, it must also be safe."
