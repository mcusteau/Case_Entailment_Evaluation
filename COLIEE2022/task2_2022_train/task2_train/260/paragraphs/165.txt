The 1976 Repta article referred to by Apotex reported that an enantiomer, completely unrelated to levofloxacin, exhibited a fivefold difference in relative water solubility as compared to its racemate. The compound disclosed in Repta is not a quinolone and has no relationship to either ofloxacin or levofloxacin. The Repta article is not valid support for an expectation of a tenfold (or even a fivefold) increase in the solubility of levofloxacin as compared to ofloxacin.
