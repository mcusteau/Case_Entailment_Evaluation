The differences in the relative solubility of levofloxacin and ofloxacin would have been unpredictable in June 1985 to a skilled person. A skilled person would not know the quantitative aspect of the relative solubility of ofloxacin and levofloxacin. (Myerson Affidavit at paras. 32-33, AR, v. 22, Tab 30, pp. 6591-6592.)
