[69]
After very careful consideration of the evidence given by both Dr. Klibanov and Dr. Richard M. Kellogg in construing claim 4 as they did, this Court finds that Apotex did not seriously consider the disclosure made within the '080 patent, although they took note of it, for all intents and purposes, they ignored it in interpreting the claim.
