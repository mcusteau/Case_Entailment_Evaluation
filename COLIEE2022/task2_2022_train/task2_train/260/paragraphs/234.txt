Justice Sharlow made this finding despite Novopharm arguing the same point that Apotex now advances, namely, that after Daiichi filed its levofloxacin patent application, at least four other competitors hit upon the same invention. This point was raised in Novopharm's Notice of Appeal:
"The Trial Judge further made a palpable and overriding error in paragraph 114(5) of the Reasons in finding that '[o]nly Daiichi was motivated to pursue these matters' and '[t]here appears to be no motivation exhibited by any outside persons to explore Ofloxacin enantiomers'."
