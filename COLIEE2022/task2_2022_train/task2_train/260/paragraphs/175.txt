The test for obviousness is strictly applied and difficult to meet. Apotex' allegation that a skilled person would have been led
directly and without difficulty
from ofloxacin to levofloxacin cannot be justified. The test for obviousness is not whether it was "worth a try". It is significant to note that in the recent decision of the
Novopharm
Appeal, the Federal Court of Appeal restated the test for obviousness in the following passage:
"[28] I would also repeat the caution of Justice Hughes that catchphrases derived from this list or from the jurisprudence are not to be treated as though they are rules of law. I agree with the following comment of Justice Hughes from paragraph 113 of his reasons:
'In this regard phrases such as "worth a try" and "directly and without difficulty" and "routine testing" have been used by the courts. It is not useful to use such phrases as they tend to work their way into expressions of law or statements of expert witnesses. Sachs, L.J., deprecated the coining of such phrases in
General Tire & Rubber Company v. Firestone Tyre & Rubber Company Limited
, [1972] R.P.C. 195 at pages 211-12.'"
