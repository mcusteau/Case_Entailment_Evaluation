Dr. Gerster's prior art references contain no information relating to the toxicity of flumequine's enantiomers relative to the racemate. In fact, a paper later published by Dr. Gerster in 1989 showed that the antimicrobial activity and toxicity of enantiomers of flumequine related compounds increased in parallel. As Dr. Rodricks testified, this finding is consistent with the common general knowledge at the date of invention that the relative toxicity of racemates and their enantiomers cannot be predicted. Another of Apotex's references, the
Haley
article from 1976, also showed that the more active enantiomer (of a racemic anesthetic compound), also had the highest toxicity. (Rodricks Affidavit at paras. 59-60, AR, v. 24, Tab 34, pp. 7128-7130.)
