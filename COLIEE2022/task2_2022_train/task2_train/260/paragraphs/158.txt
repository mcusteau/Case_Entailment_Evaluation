Acute intravenous toxicity tests are relevant
: Apotex alleges that the acute toxicity data in the '080 patent is not significant because pharmaceuticals are formulated at concentrations substantially lower than those used to test acute toxicity levels. According to Dr. Rodricks, however, this does not negate the importance of acute toxicity testing for screening compounds for pharmaceutical use. (Rodricks Affidavit at para. 14, AR, v. 24, Tab 34, p. 7114.)
