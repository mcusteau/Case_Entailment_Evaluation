Apotex argues that ophthalmic purposes are not spelled out in the patent and are therefore "after discovered" and can't be used to rebut an obviousness allegation. It is the solubility and not its applicability that is the property. Page 2 of the patent simply promises an expectation that levofloxacin will be a useful pharmaceutical product as compared to ofloxacin as a result of the properties disclosed.
