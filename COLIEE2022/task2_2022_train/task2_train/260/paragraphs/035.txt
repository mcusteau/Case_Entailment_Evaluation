Justice Hughes found that claim 4 of the '080 patent was valid and infringed as the defendant had failed to establish that the said claim was invalid on the basis of obviousness or lack of inventive ingenuity. Despite the fact that the claim does not address medical properties or uses, Justice Hughes found, at paragraph 96, that, where the compound is new, it is sufficient that its utility be set out in the specification. He also found that the prior art did not contain any direction that the enantiomers of ofloxacin would be more active than the racemate nor did it instruct the skilled person as to how to separate or produce an enantiomer; therefore, claim 4 of the patent was not anticipated. Moreover, Justice Hughes determined that levofloxacin was of sufficient "inventive ingenuity" to merit valid patent protection as set out in claim 4. Recognizing that his finding was different than that of Justice Mosley, Justice Hughes explains that he benefited from extensive evidence that was not previously presented and determined that Novopharm failed to establish that claim 4 was invalid on the basis of obviousness or lack of inventive ingenuity.
