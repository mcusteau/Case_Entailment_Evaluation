Dr. Klibanov states, at paragraph 51 of his affidavit, that "a POSITA would purposively construe Claim 4 of the '080 Patent to encompass both anhydrous levofloxacin (Example 11) and levofloxacin hemihydrate (Example 7). In other words, from inclusion of Examples 11 and 7 in the '080 Patent, a POSITA would clearly understand the intent of the inventors that Claim 4 should encompass both anhydrous levofloxacin and levofloxacin hemihydrate." Consequently, he explained that levofloxacin hemihydrate falls within claim 4 of the '080 patent, and, therefore, Apotex' proposed tablets will infringe these claims. Claim 4 is not restricted to a hydrated or non-hydrated form. The principal disclosure of the '080 patent explicitly teaches the production of levofloxacin hemihydrate at Example 7.
