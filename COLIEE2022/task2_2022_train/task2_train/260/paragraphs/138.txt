The Flumequine (Gerster) References did not encourage resolving enantiomers:
Dr. Klibanov testified that the earlier Gerster references taught that it was not worthwhile to resolve quinolone racemates. "[T]he mixture of stereoisomers is generally conveniently used to obtain antibacterial action". Dr. Gerster's 1976 United States Patent No. 3,976,651 ("'651 Patent") states:
"... Although it has been found that in
some cases,
one isomer
may
have more antimicrobial activity than another, sufficient activity is obtained with a compound containing a mixture of isomers so as to make isolation of the individual isomers unnecessary." (Emphasis added)
