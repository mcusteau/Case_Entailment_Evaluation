The isolation of levofloxacin (that is, the (-)-or (S)- enantiomer of ofloxacin) is described within the '080 patent. The patent explicitly teaches that levofloxacin is twice as potent, less toxic, and ten times more soluble than ofloxacin, the racemic containing both levofloxacin and (+)-ofloxacin.
