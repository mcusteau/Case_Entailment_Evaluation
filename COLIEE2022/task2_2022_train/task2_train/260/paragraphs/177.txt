[177]
Patent claims may not exceed the invention that was made and must not exceed the invention described in the specification. The assessment of whether the claims exceed the invention made or disclosed is a question of fact, and requires the Court to construe both the disclosure and the claims based on the knowledge of a person of ordinary skill in the art.
