As compared to ofloxacin, levofloxacin has improved solubility, higher activity, and lower toxicity. The superior properties of levofloxacin are inherent in the invention disclosed by the '080 patent. When assessing obviousness, a court must ask whether the
invention is
obvious to a skilled person in light of the prior art and common general knowledge. In this case, it is, therefore, necessary to ask whether levofloxacin
and
its unexpected properties would have been obvious to a skilled person, in June 1985. (
