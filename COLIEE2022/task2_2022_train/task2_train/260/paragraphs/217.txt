[217]
The '840 patent discloses and claims racemic ofloxacin. It does not disclose the S(-) enantiomers (levofioxacin), its unexpectedly superior properties, or a process to produce levofioxacin. This specific finding has been made not once but twice in this Court as the basis to dismiss an attack of invalidity by anticipation. (
