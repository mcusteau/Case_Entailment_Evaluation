It is clear that there is no express duty of candour contained in the
Patent
Act
or the
Patent Rules
and that the word "candour" does not even appear in this legislation. While a duty of candour and good faith exists during the prosecution of patent applications in the United States Patent Office, a similar duty does not exist in Canada. The facts alleged by Apotex in its NOA are addressed by subsection 30(1) of the
Patent
Act
and paragraphs 40(l)(a), 40(1)(c) and section 45 of the
Patent Rules
. There is no basis in Canadian law for the separate allegation of breach of candour put forth by Apotex. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in
Bourgault Industries Ltd. v. Flexi-Coil Ltd.
, the disclosure required "can only be ... that which the statute, the rules and the jurisprudence already require. Furthermore, even if the duty of disclosure had been extended as suggested by counsel, the impact of the extension would be felt not at the level of the validity of the patent but at the level of the remedies where equitable considerations might come into play." (Stewart Affidavit paras. 68-70, AR, v. 29, Tab 42, p. 9081;
Bourgault Industries Ltd. v. Flexi-Coil Ltd.
(1999), 237 N.R. 74; 86 C.P.R.(3d) 221 (F.C.A.), at 231-232 [C.P.R.], affing. (1998), 141 F.T.R. 268; 80 C.P.R.(3d) 1; 78 A.C.W.S.(3d) 373 (T.D.).)
