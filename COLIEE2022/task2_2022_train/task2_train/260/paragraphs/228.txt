Apotex asserts it has "better evidence" to overcome the finding of nonobviousness made by Justice Hughes in the
Novopharm
Trial, namely:
རྭ attention was given to enantiomers;
རྭ competitors were motivated to obtain levofloxacin;
རྭ the properties of levofloxacin were expected;
རྭ there were many techniques to isolate or synthesize the optical isomers of ofloxacin; and
རྭ the efforts of Daiichi were not extraordinary.
