Mr. Oyen admitted that his opinion that the application was abandoned is based solely on personal practice and he cannot reference any guidelines, practice directions, rules, regulations or the Manual of Patent Office Practice to support his opinion. There is nothing in the
Patent
Act
or
Patent Rules
that supports his opinion that every requirement in an office action must be responded to in order to constitute a bona fide attempt to advance the application to allowance. There is also nothing in the
Patent
Act
or
Patent Rules
that supports his exercise of prescribing weight to each requirement raised by an examiner in an Office Action. (Oyen Cross at qq. 99-112, 125-127, 153, AR, v. 51, Tab 82, pp. 15848-16849, 16851.)
