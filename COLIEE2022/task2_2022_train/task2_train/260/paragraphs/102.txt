The Applicants submit that, when considering anticipation, one cannot "bring to bear" on the '840 patent the techniques and skills of the day; however, even if the common general knowledge on how to resolve enantiomers is permitted in an anticipation analysis, there were no routine techniques available in 1984 (or for that matter, 1985) that would enable a person of skill to resolve ofloxacin into its enantiomers. While there were techniques available to separate enantiomers generally, these techniques offered no assurance that a substantially optically pure enantiomer of a new racemate itself could be obtained, or even a substantially optically pure enantiomer of an intermediate. Dr. Kellogg admitted that he did not locate the three processes disclosed in the '080 patent to produce levofloxacin (Processes A, B and C) in any prior art reference. Even the Daiichi inventors took four years to obtain levofloxacin after first using these recognized techniques.
