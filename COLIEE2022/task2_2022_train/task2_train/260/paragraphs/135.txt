Dr. Klibanov highlighted major differences between these two compounds:
(a)
Substituent on the fluorinated ring
: The difference in size of the hydrogen atom when compared with the methyl-piperazine substituent will cause flumequine and ofloxacin to interact in distinct ways with their intended biological targets, including that the N-methylated piperazine is an amine group that significantly changes the reactivity of the molecule. It would be expected that flumequine and ofloxacin would behave in unique ways and would have distinct properties.
(b)
Different core structures
: Ofloxacin has an oxygen atom in the ring containing the chiral carbon atom. At the same position in flumequine is a carbon atom (in the form of a methylene group). Based on this substitution, one would expect the nature and properties of the two compounds to be fundamentally different.
