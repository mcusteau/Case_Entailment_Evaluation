At the
Novopharm
Trial, Justice Roger Hughes, held that the date of invention was December 1985:
"[50] It can be seen through this course of development that the final element of claim 4, determination of the S configuration, had been made by December 1985. I find therefore, that December 1985 is the relevant date of invention for consideration of issues as to inventive ingenuity and obviousness with respect to claim 4."
