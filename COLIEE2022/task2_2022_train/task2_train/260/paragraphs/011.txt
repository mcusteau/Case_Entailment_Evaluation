Ofloxacin is an old substance. A skilled chemist would know its chemical structure and would be aware that it contains a feature known as a "chiral centre". This feature is important to the present case as a molecule with a chiral centre can exist in one of two possible three-dimensional forms. The word "enantiomers" is used to describe the relationship between the two possible three-dimensional forms. Enantiomers are mirror images of each other and can be likened to the right and left hand version of the same compound. While enantiomers are similar in many respects, they have different chemical properties and often very different biological effects when administered as medicines.
