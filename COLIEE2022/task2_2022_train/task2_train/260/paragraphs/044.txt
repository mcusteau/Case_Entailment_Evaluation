More appropriate legal argument
: Apotex submits that it has raised novel legal arguments that were not previously before the Court; however, the arguments may be based on different evidence but that does not necessarily make of "novel" arguments, better evidence, of itself. It contends that, contrary to the evidence that was previously before this Court (1) attention was given to enantiomers; (2) competitors were motivated to obtain levofloxacin; (3) properties of levofloxacin were expected; (4) there were many techniques to isolate or synthesize the enantiomers of ofloxacin; and (5) efforts of Daiichi were not extraordinary.
