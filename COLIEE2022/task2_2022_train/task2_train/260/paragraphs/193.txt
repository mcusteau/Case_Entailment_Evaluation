[193]
The examiner's July 14, 1989 Official Action made 8 requirements of the Applicant. There is no issue that the Applicant fully answered 7 of these requirements within the required time. This in itself constitutes a bona fide attempt to advance the application to allowance. (Stewart Affidavit at paras. 20-28, AR, v. 30, Tab 43, pp. 9066-9068.)
