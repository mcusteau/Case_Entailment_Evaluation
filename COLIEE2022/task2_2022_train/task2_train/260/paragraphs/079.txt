Similarly, the construction proposed by Apotex' witnesses in this case - namely, that claim 4 does not cover levofloxacin hemihydrate - leads to the conclusion that the '080 Patent specifically teaches a skilled person how to avoid infringing claim 4 by explicitly teaching, by way of Example 7, a process to produce levofloxacin hemihydrate. To adopt the language of Justice Marc Nadon, this "view cannot be characterized as one ensuring the attainment of the inventor's intention, nor can it be viewed as a construction arrived at by a mind willing to understand and attempting to achieve success."
