Acute toxicity testing is frequently relied upon in the drug development process. Dr. Rodricks testified that a skilled person would understand that the data in the '080 patent is a positive indication that levofloxacin, as compared to ofloxacin, will be less toxic in humans; however, clinical trials are necessary to confirm toxicity in humans. (Rodricks Affidavit at para. 45, AR, v. 24, Tab 34, p. 7124.)
