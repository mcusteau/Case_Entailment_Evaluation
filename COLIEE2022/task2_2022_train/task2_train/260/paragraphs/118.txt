[118]
At the
Novopharm
Trial, Justice Hughes found that the 1982 Gerster poster was not prior art for the purposes of an obviousness analysis:
"[57] ... The evidence satisfies me that the poster was not published by way of distribution and could not have been found using a reasonably diligent search as of 1985. A public display for three hours at a scientific meeting does not mean that the poster has entered into the body of prior art of which a person skilled in the art could be said to possess or of which they could make themselves aware through a reasonably diligent search."
