Apotex alleges that claims 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 19 do not include within their scope the compound levofloxacin hemihydrate - the active ingredient contained within Apotex' tablets. Moreover, it contends that levofloxacin hemihydrate is a different chemical substance from levofloxacin. (NOA, p. 3495 AR.)
