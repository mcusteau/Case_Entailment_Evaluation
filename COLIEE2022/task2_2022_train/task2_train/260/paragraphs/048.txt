[48]
The Applicants submit that many, if not all, of Apotex' arguments have been considered by the Court in prior proceedings. In particular, it is apparent that the Court has previously considered whether the patent disclosure provides adequate information to support a finding that levofloxacin has an unexpected advantage over the prior art. Thus, it will be difficult for Apotex to assert that it has a "more appropriate legal argument". It will also be difficult for Apotex to argue it has better evidence on this point.
