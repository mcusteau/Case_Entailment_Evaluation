Process A is a method for producing levofloxacin that involves optical resolution of a (Â±)-3,5-dinitrobenzoate compound into two optically active compounds using an appropriate method such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). ('080 patent, p. 1, 1.1-8; Hayakawa Affidavit, Exhibit A, AR, v. 4, Tab 6(A), p. 741; Hayakawa Affidavit at paras. 29-40, v. 4, Tab 6, pp. 715-716.) Process B is a method for producing levofloxacin that involves using specific enzymes to asymmetrically hydrolyze racemic intermediates to obtain optically active intermediates that can be separated using an appropriate method such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). ('080 patent, p. 12, 1.1-16, Hayakawa Affidavit, Exhibit A, AR, v. 4, Tab 6(a), p. 746; Hayakawa Affidavit at paras. 26-28, 41, 42, v. 6, pp. 714-715, 719-720.) Process C is a method for producing levofloxacin that involves using a compound known as N-tosyl-l-proline to obtain an intermediate that can be separated in optically active intermediates, using an appropriate method such as chromatography. ('080 patent, pp. 17, 1.7-18, 1.23; Hayakawa Affidavit, Exhibit A, AR, v. 4, tab 6(A), pp. 751-752; Hayakawa Affidavit at paras. 43-48, v. 4, Tab 6, pp. 720-721.)
