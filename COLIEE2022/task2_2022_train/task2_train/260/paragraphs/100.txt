The '840 patent does not mention stereochemistry. It discusses the racemic compound ofloxacin. Sophisticated chemical techniques are necessary to separate (i.e., resolve) ofloxacin into its enantiomers and it is impossible to manually separate ofloxacin into its S(-) and R(+) enantiomers. The '080 patent teaches that levofloxacin is not produced from racemic ofloxacin, but always from an intermediate. A skilled person following the teaching in the '840 patent and producing racemic ofloxacin would have gone too far and could not obtain levofloxacin. Dr. Kellogg, Apotex' witness, agreed that the '840 patent only deals with racemates. In his opinion, based on the '840 patent, a person of skill would attempt direct resolution of ofloxacin, as opposed to working with intermediate compounds. Such attempts were made by the inventors but proved unsuccessful.
