Acute i.v. toxicity studies are preferred over oral
: Dr. Rodricks testified that the results of the acute oral one-dose lethality studies performed by Daiichi were confounded by absorption due to differing solubilities. Levofloxacin has a much greater solubility than ofloxacin. At lower doses - Daiichi did a range of studies looking at central nervous system toxicity - where both drugs would be in solution and readily absorbed, regardless of whether oral or i.v. administration is used; levofloxacin consistently demonstrated reduced toxicity.

(c) Levofloxacin's increased solubility was unexpected
