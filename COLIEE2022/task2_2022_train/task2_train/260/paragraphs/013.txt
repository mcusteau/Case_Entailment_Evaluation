In the case of ofloxacin, one enantiomer is referred to as (+)-ofloxacin (or alternatively as R-ofloxacin or R(+)-ofloxacin). The other enantiomer is referred to as (-)-ofloxacin (or alternatively as S-ofloxacin or S(-)-ofloxacin). For the purposes of this case, it is important to note that the S or (-) enantiomer of ofloxacin is called levofloxacin.
