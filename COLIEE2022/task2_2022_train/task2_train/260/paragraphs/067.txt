As Dr. Klibanov further points out in his affidavit, Apotex explicitly acknowledges in its NOA, that Example 7 teaches levofloxacin hemihydrate:
"Example 7 of European Patent Application No. 206,283 A2 describes the preparation and characterization of levofloxacin hemihydrate."
European Patent Application No. 206,283 A2 ("EPA 283") is a foreign equivalent to the '080 patent (i.e., they share a common priority document). Further, Example 7 in the EPA 283 is identical to Example 7 in the '080 patent; both originate from an example in the first Japanese priority application.
