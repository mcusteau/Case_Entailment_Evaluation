Activity Evidence:
There is no generalized expectation that the bulk of the activity of a racemic quinolone would reside in one enantiomer. Apotex' Dr. Castagnoli admitted on cross- examination that any difference in biological outcome as a result of chirality could be so small that it could not be measured.
