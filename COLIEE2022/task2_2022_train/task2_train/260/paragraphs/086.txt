[86]
To respond to Apotex' selection patent argument, it is significant to note that Dr. Klibanov has addressed in his affidavit:
"94. ... There is no statement in the '080 Patent which indicates that it is a selection patent. Accordingly, this appears to be nothing more than a categorization of the '080 Patent by Apotex.
"95. I am advised by counsel for the Applicants that a selection patent presumes there is aprior, enabling disclosure of a genus of compounds and that the selection patent relates to a selection of sub-group of the genus. As stated above, the '840 Patent
would not enable a POSITA to directly extract or otherwise isolate either of the enantiomers from ofloxacin
. Accordingly, it is my opinion that the '840 Patent does not provide an enabling disclosure of the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin. In the circumstances, the '080 Patent is not a selection patent, and all of the statements made on pages 20 and 21 of the NOA relating to selection patents are without foundation."
