 von Finckenstein, J. 
 : The applicants are a family of five from Mexico. Adrian Chavez Arenas (the Principal Applicant) owned a shoe store that was broken into by one Ernesto Gonzalez. The Principal Applicant informed the police about Gonzalez and sued Gonzalez for the value of the stolen merchandise. As a result, he was threatened by Gonzalez, beaten and mistreated. The police refused to investigate the matter further considering it unnecessary to do so as he had already reported the first instance. His law suit was unsuccessful, and Gonzalez was acquitted in the theft proceedings.
