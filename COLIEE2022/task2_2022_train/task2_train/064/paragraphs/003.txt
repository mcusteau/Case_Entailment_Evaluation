  The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Board") refused his refugee claim finding: 
 
 
 
 a. that the Applicant's delay in making a claim, (six months after they came to Canada and three months after their visa expired) evidenced a lack of subjective fear of persecution; and 
 
 
 
 b. that the Applicants had not shown that state protection was not available in Mexico.
