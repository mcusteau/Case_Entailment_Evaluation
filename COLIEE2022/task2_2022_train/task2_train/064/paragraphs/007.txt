 [7] 
  It is well established that the Applicant has the onus of establishing a lack of state protection. His testimony (which was not found to lack credibility by the Board) was contradicted by the documentary evidence. The Board addressed this point when it stated: 
 
 
 
 The principal claimant alleged that his store was broken into at various items and a total of $US3,500 dollars was taken. The principal claimant alleged that he had witnesses who indicated that Mr. Gonzales was the perpetrator of the break-in. The panel finds that at all times the principal claimant was able to go to the authorities, the authorities took his denunciation, and the principal claimant was able to sue Mr. Gonzales in court. The fact that the judge did not rule in the principal claimant's favour is not an indication of lack of state of protection. In regard to further ramifications from Mr. Gonzales, the principal claimant indicated that Mr. Gonzales threatened him, yet he did not go back and report this to the police. Considering that the police did not ignore the principal claimant when he first made his claim against Mr. Gonzales, there is no reason to expect that they would not take the principal claimant seriously on another occasion if he were to be assaulted and went to the police to complain about a perpetrator in the future.
