Section 39 of the
Act
requires that when credible evidence is presented during a proceeding, the Board has a duty to consider and weigh the credible evidence in the best interests of the applicant (see
Brychka v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 124; 141 F.T.R. 258 (T.D.);
Metcalfe v. Canada
, [1999] F.C.J. No. 22; 160 F.T.R. 281 (T.D.)). The Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
Chenier
, supra, discussing section 108 of the
Pension Act
, which was virtually identical in every material respect to section 39 of the current
Act
, is authority for the proposition that the Board must draw every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant. The Board fails in the exercise its jurisdiction when it summarily arrives at the conclusion that the member was not engaged in an activity giving rise to a pension without "expressly dealing with the evidence from which an inference favourable to the Applicant might have been drawn.".
