The respondent further submitted that it was open to the Board upon the evidence before it to conclude that there was no causal link between the applicant's low back pain and his military service. Noting that 80% of the population suffer from back pain, counsel argues that the applicant has not proven that his condition is specifically linked to service-related activities as opposed to an activity also engaged in by civilian sufferers of low back pain. The respondent further points out that the applicant's 1998 Medical Examination for Release does not indicate what caused the applicant's low back pain, aside from his own recollection of its cause. Regarding the applicant's contention that Major Zaporzan's evidence was not considered by the Board, counsel submits that the Board referred to Major Zaporzan's letter in its reasons but did not give it much weight because Major Zaporzan is not a physician and therefore was not qualified to diagnose the applicant's injury.
