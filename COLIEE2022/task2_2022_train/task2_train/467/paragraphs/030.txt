In its reasons, the Board wrote that "There is no medical record available [for the applicant] since November 1996". Immediately following that, the Board writes "The Medical Examiner at the time of the Medical Examination for Release dated 10 February 1998 simply indicated that the Appellant 'has had low back pain.'" Clearly, there was a medical record available since 1996 in the form of the 1998 Medical Examination for Release report. I note that this report does more than simply state that the applicant has had low back pain. Rather it states that the applicant has had low back pain, which originated in the Spring of 1995 and was related to training and a hockey injury, in activity that the applicant claims was service related. The report also provides that the applicant controls the pain through stretching and physiotherapy.
