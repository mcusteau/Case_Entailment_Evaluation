Mr. Wood's back pain was further aggravated in October 1996 when he landed on his lower spine following a hit while playing organized hockey at a Canadian Forces Command and Staff College sports event. Medical treatment and physiotherapy reduced the pain. A physiotherapy report, dated November 12, 1996, indicates that Mr. Wood's back had improved somewhat.
