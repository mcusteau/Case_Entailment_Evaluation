The Board also states in its reasons that "there is no documentation to support a service related injury". With all due respect to the Board and the difficult task that it performs, I find the Board's conclusion on this matter is without regard to the evidence before it. The applicant's medical records and Major Zaporzan's letter are some evidence of a low back injury caused in training for an EXPRESS fitness test of the military and by a hockey injury that took place during a Canadian Forces Command and Staff College event. This evidence is uncontradicted.
