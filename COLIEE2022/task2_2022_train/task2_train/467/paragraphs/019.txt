The respondent submits that the Board did not err in its decision of September 8, 1999 and it was not patently unreasonable for it to conclude that the applicant does not have a disability meriting a pension. It is submitted that the Board considered all of the evidence before it, including the letter of Major Zaporzan, in a favourable manner to the applicant and reasonably concluded that there was no evidence of a disability for which the applicant could claim a pension. Counsel agrees that Mr. Wood may have suffered an injury to his lower back, but that the Board had evidence before it, i.e. the applicant's 1996 medical report, that indicated that the applicant's back had improved and his records contained no subsequent annual or other record of continued complaint. As a result, there was no evidence upon which the Board could conclude that the applicant had a disability.
