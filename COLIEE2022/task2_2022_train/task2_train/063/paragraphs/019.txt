  Mr. Justice Evans went on to say that the standard of review needs to be reformulated in light of current developments in administrative law: 
 
 
 
 "In my opinion the standard of review applied to the Registrar's findings of confusion needs to be reformulated to take account of the pragmatic and functional analysis developed in contemporary administrative law jurisprudence for selecting the standard of review appropriate for the issue in dispute. In undertaking this exercise I am following the path already indicated by Lutfy, J., in  
 Young Drivers of Canada v. Chan 
 , [1999] F.C.J. No. 1321, (F.C.T.D.; T-636-97; August, 30, 1999). However, the end result of the analysis may differ relatively little from the Court's established practice." Ibid. at p. 230-231.
