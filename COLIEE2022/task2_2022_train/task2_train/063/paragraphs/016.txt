  The applicant filed further evidence in relation to this appeal as permitted by section 56(5) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 . The new evidence consisted of the Affidavit of Peter A. Reich and the Affidavits of Jennifer Leah Stecyk. While the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  allows the introduction of additional evidence upon an appeal pursuant to section 56 and permits the Court to exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar in responding to such evidence, the mere fact that new evidence is introduced upon an appeal does not turn the proceedings into a new trial.
