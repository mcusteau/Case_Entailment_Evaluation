  The applicant is appealing against the decision of the Registrar dated March 16, 1999, in which the Registrar refused registration of "SATIN STRIPES" as a proposed trademark on the grounds that the name was descriptive. In his decision, the Registrar found that the proposed name was suggestive of the materials used in the composition of the wares, that is bras and panties. The Registrar made the following conclusion: 
 
 
 
 "I have carefully reviewed the appellant's submissions and I consider that the average or everyday consumer when faced with this trade-mark used in association with bras and panties would immediately conclude as a matter of first impression, that the wares are striped with satin."
