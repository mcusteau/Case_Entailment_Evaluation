  That question was addressed by this Court in  
 Garbo Group Inc. v. Brown (Harriet) & Co. et al. 
  (1999), 176 F.T.R. 80; 3 C.P.R.(4th) 224 (T.D.). Mr. Justice Evans looked at the question in the context of the appropriate standard of review to be applied to a decision of the Registrar of Trademarks and said at p. 232: 
 
 
 
 "Indeed, even when additional evidence is admitted on appeal, it still may be appropriate to ask whether the Registrar's decision was wrong in the light of that evidence, rather than how the appellate court would have decided the question if it had been before the court de novo. Of course, the more significant the additional evidence the greater the scope for the court to exercise its own independent judgment on the finding of fact in question."
