  The issue of the right of a Tribunal whose decision is under review to appear as a party in a hearing was considered by this Court in  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Bernard 
  (1993), 69 F.T.R. 239 (T.D.). In  
 Bernard 
 , Madam Justice McGillis dealt with a request by the Canadian Human Rights Commission to obtain status as a respondent in a review of a decision made by that Commission. She refused the request, but without prejudice to the right of the Commission to seek intervener status.
