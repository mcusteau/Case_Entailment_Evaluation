  In my view, the Attorney General of Canada should have been named as the respondent in the beginning. Rule 303(3) provides a mechanism by which the Attorney General can make submissions to the Court as to why she should not be the respondent. Upon receipt of such submissions, the Court may substitute another person or body including the Tribunal whose decision is the subject of the application for judicial review.
