The applicant appealed the Canadian Pension Commission decision to a Commission Entitlement Board. In a decision dated April 5, 1995, the appeal was denied as the applicant's medical evidence did not meet the minimal requirements for hearing loss disability as described in the table of disabilities established by the Canadian Pension Commission. The applicant appealed this decision to the Veterans Review and Appeal Board and in a decision dated March 25, 1996, the Board confirmed the decision of the Commission Entitlement Board. On January 27, 1998, the applicant filed an application for reconsideration of the March 25, 1996 decision and this appeal was denied after the Veterans Review and Appeal Board considered the new evidence and affirmed the earlier Board decision. The new evidence included a letter from Dr. Weir dated May 20, 1997 wherein he stated "... he has a noise induced hearing loss which is related to his time in the RCMP". In making this decision the Board did admit the new evidence and reviewed it before making two findings:
a) there are no documents or records to demonstrate that the applicant had a hearing loss disability at the date of release from the RCMP in August 1975; and
b) the audiograms of 1989, 1992 and 1996 do not disclose the existence of a hearing loss disability as defined by the current Minister's hearing loss guidelines.
