All of these factors are present in this case. The purpose of the hearing was to establish that the applicant had met the conditions for the stay. Apparently unbeknownst to the applicant, it was also a hearing to decide the appeal of the deportation order. The member brought out the shortcomings in the file; nobody argued the favourable points. The applicant learned just the day before the hearing that he would appear alone. The consequences are very serious: by removing the applicant from Canada, he is removed from the only family he has, since he no longer has family in Ha√Øti. Moreover, he is removed from his children. The first decision in 1997 referred to the applicant's limited intellect, also an obstacle to his integrating easily in society. Reviewing the transcript, we cannot believe for an instant that the applicant had the right to a fair hearing, since he was unable to argue his case. Moreover, I would add that the applicant had a reasonable expectation of a postponement, since he had always appeared accompanied by counsel.
