The member presiding over the hearing decided to proceed. The Notice to Appear had been dated June 5, 2003, and the applicant should have had enough time to make necessary arrangements with his counsel. The applicant explained that he had spoken with counsel in June and that she had told him that they would meet in August for the case. In August, he was stuck in Ha√Øti without a return flight.
