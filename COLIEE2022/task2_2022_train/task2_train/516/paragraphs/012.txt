I now turn to Article 1 of the Convention and note that, although judges have differed about the scope of a removals officer's discretion to defer a removal, they have generally agreed (i) that a removals officer is not required to conduct a full scale humanitarian and compassionate review and (ii) that, in most circumstances, a pending H & C application will not justify the deferral of a removal. That said, the question in this case is whether, when the father is being removed and the children are remaining in Canada, should the removals officer defer the removal pending the outcome of the H & C Application in order to give effect to Canada's obligations under Article 1 of the Convention? In my view, the answer is "yes" for the reasons which follow.
