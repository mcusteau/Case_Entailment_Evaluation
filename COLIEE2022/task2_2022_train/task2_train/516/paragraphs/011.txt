Article 9(4) of the Convention recognizes that there will be situations in which children are separated from their parents by state actions including deportations and I have found nothing in the Convention which prohibits a parent's removal. In other words, in spite of the Convention, Canada is entitled to separate children from their parents in situations in which the parents have no legal status in Canada.
