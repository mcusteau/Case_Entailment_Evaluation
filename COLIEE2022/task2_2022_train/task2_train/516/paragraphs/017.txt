As well, there is no doubt that the Wife and the daughter (who is almost three years old) will be distressed if the Applicant is removed. However, there is no medical evidence to suggest that the impact on the daughter will be disproportionate or aggravated by any circumstances. In particular, there is no evidentiary support for the Applicant's suggestion, that she will become "aggressive" with her baby brother. Further, since she has never known her biological father, it is hard to credit the Applicant's concern that she will be deprived of a father figure "again".
