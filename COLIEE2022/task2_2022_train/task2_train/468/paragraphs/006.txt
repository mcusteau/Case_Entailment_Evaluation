In the 2002 decision, the Division did an overview of the years that the stay had been in effect. On the positive side, the applicant had not re-offended since 1993. On the negative side, however, the applicant's integration into Canadian society was still unsatisfactory. He did not have steady employment, he had a substantial debt with social security which still had not been paid, he failed to file documents at the Division attesting to his search for employment and employment, if any, as he had been asked to do, he failed to file income tax returns, and documents relating to the social security debt and the arrangements made to pay it.
