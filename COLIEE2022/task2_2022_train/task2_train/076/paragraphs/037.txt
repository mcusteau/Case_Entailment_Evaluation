  A review of the transcripts from the hearing before the Board indicates that Mr. San Juan's ties to organized crime were an important topic of discussion. However, counsel's submissions before the Board do not make a link between Mr. San Juan's ties to organized crime, and the applicant's inability to avail herself of an IFA. By raising this argument before the Court, the applicant is asking the Court to make factual determinations on the basis of arguments which were not before the Board. This does not amount to an error on the part of the Board.
