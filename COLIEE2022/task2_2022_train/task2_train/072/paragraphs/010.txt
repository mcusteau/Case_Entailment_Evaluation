  The Board noted that the Applicant's partner had not provided information enumerating the hardships she would incur if her relationship with the Applicant was severed. Similarly, there was no evidence from the Applicant's daughter that she would not be willing or able to assist the Applicant, if only emotionally, should she be returned to St. Vincent. The Applicant's reliance on friends and community members for errands and doctor's appointments as well as her involvement in church-related tasks was acknowledged by the Board. While it was reasonable to expect that the Applicant maintained meaningful personal ties while in Canada, she had not established that severing these ties would have a significant negative impact on her that would constitute an unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
