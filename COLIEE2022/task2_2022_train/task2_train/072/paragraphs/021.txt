  According to the Applicant, the Officer ignored evidence that she is unable to meet daily needs without the assistance of friends and community members. However, I am not convinced that the Officer failed to address this particular aspect of the application. The Officer expressly refers to this evidence in a section entitled "Personal ties that would create hardship if severed." It comments on the details of a letter from the Applicant's pastor describing the degree of her involvement in church activities. While she asserted that assistance from friends and community members was required to perform daily activities, the Officer found this evidence did not specifically support her claim. Based on what was before the Officer, weighing the evidence of friends and community support in this manner was reasonable.
