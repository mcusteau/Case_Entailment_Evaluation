  While not a clear breach of procedural fairness, however, I do have concerns regarding the Officer's approach to assessing the evidence related to government assistance. Initially the Officer focused on the ability of the Applicant to find work as a former cosmetics and crafts vendor in St. Vincent and proceeded to suggest that if her condition deteriorated government assistance would be available to her. Based on the evidence, it is clear that the Applicant's condition has already deteriorated while here in Canada to the point where she is unable to work and relies on disability benefits. Any reference to her ability to work in St. Vincent is at odds with the preponderance of evidence before the Officer.
