The procedure in citizenship appeals has been changed by the
Federal Court Rules, 1998
which came into force on April 25, 1998. Under the former
Rules
, a citizenship appeal was a trial de novo and there was a distinct set of rules governing its conduct. Under the new
Rules
, citizenship appeals proceed by way of an application based on the record before the citizenship judge and are governed by the general
Rules
applicable to applications: rule 300(c).
