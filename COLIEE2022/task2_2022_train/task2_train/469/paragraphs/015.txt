The idea that the Officer or the Delegate has the ability, let alone the responsibility, to assess the level of individual culpability of the Applicants is, in practical and legal terms, untenable.  The same can be said for the argument that, in forming the necessary opinions, the Officer and the Delegate should have considered whether false statements made in the context of the applications to renew permanent residency cards could ever constitute misrepresentations upon which inadmissibility findings could be made and whether, in two of the cases, an abuse of process had occurred.  The obvious place to advance such matters is before the ID and, where available, before the IAD where adjudicative processes are in place and where conflicting evidence can be properly tested and complex legal issues concerning admissibility can be considered.  I would add that the argument that a misrepresentation cannot legally arise from a misrepresentation made in connection with an application to obtain or renew a permanent residency card was firmly rejected by Justice Ann Marie McDonald in Geng v Canada, 2017 FC 1155, 286 ACWS 3d 728.
