I will make a further observation about the Applicants’ approach to the s 44 process.  Not one of the Applicants provided sworn evidence about their awareness of what Mr. Wang was doing on their behalf.  The only “evidence” of a lack of complicity provided to the Officer came from the Applicants’ counsel’s uncorroborated representations.  It seems implausible that Mr. Wang’s involvement would have been required to simply renew the Applicants’ permanent residency cards.  Although such a renewal may not be conditional on meeting the minimum residency requirement, a truthful representation of time spent in Canada could have triggered a residency enquiry with a resulting loss of status.  This concern was more likely to have been behind the retainer of Mr. Wang by the Applicants than the bare renewal of their residency cards.  But, in any event, it was not unreasonable for the Delegate to refer these complex evidentiary and legal arguments to the ID.  Furthermore, whatever the scope of the discretion, in the absence of sworn corroboration counsel’s attestations of the Applicants’ innocence were deserving of little, if any, weight.
