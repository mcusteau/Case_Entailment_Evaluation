The Applicants maintain that they are all innocent and unknowing victims of Mr. Wang and that, in referring their cases to an admissibility hearing before the ID, the decision-makers failed to consider their asserted lack of individual complicity.  On this issue the common argument they advance is the following:
21.   The Respondent’s counsel appears to be advancing the same belief of the Minister’s Delegate in charge of admissibility referrals, that as a group these clients of the fraudulent consultant are all complicit without the need to see evidence of their individual complicity.
22.   The Respondent presented no evidence of complicity by these Applicants.  The only evidence that the Respondent has is incorrectly stated days of absences from Canada.  While that may be sufficient to allege misrepresentation under the Respondent’s current understanding of the law, each case will still have to be assessed individually to see (1) if the under-reporting of absences constitutes misrepresentation under 40(1)(a) of IRPA; (2) the materiality and seriousness of the misrepresentation which requires an examination of the evidence with respect to complicity; (3) given the level of seriousness found, what corresponding level of humanitarian and compassionate grounds is required to overcome such seriousness so that the discretion not to refer may be exercised.
