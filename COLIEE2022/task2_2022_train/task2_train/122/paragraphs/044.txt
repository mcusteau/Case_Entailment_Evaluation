 [44] 
  In this context, the version of the Regulations that is applicable to a determination of an appeal by the IAD is the version that was in force  
 at the time the parties made their submissions to the IAD 
 . However, if the parties have a full opportunity to supplement their prior written submissions with oral submissions  
 at the time of the IAD's hearing 
 , then the version of the Regulations which ought to be applied by the IAD is the version that was in force  
 at that time 
 . I acknowledge that there may be situations in which a subsequent amendment to the Regulations has no bearing on any of the submissions that were made by the parties, and that in such situations, it may be appropriate for the IAD to apply that amended version of the Regulations, i.e., the version that was in force  
 at the time of its decision 
 .
