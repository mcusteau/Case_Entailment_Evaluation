  I find this result troubling. However, I have not been provided with any authority that would enable me to find that the IAD's application of the Regulations currently in force was contrary to any principle of Canadian law. In fact, the applicable legal principles support, in a general way, the Respondent's position. Accordingly, I am unable to accept Ms. Kaur Gill's position that the IAD erred by failing to apply the previous version of the Regulations in considering her spousal sponsorship application.
