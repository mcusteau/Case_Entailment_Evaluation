 [51] 
  At the end of the hearing of this application, Ms. Kaur Gill's counsel tentatively proposed two questions for certification regarding the test that the IAD applied in rejecting her spousal sponsorship application. However, upon reflection, and after the Respondent confirmed in writing its opposition to those questions, Ms. Kaur Gill's counsel submitted that further litigation would inhibit her effort to reunite with Mr. Gill and that she no longer wished to have a question certified.
