A Citizenship Officer (the Officer) reviewed the renewed application and noted that the photocopy provided of a passport was missing pages and was partly illegible. The Officer concluded that the Respondent had stayed outside of Canada voluntarily to run his business in France during the review period, that his trips to Canada constituted a pattern of visiting, and that he had not established himself permanently in Canada. In addition, the Officer was unable to establish the exact length of the Respondent's physical presence in Canada because of insufficient documentation.
