I summarize below the findings upon which the Judge based her decision. In her decision the Judge refers to the Respondent as "the client".
The client's physical absence from Canada was for business reasons only;
• The client's connection with Canada is very strong;
• Despite being now divorced and alienated from his children, the client works at Ft. McMurray and hopes that the situation with his family will improve;
• The client's date of landing was 24 October 1998 and in 1999 he spent 20 days in France for business. His revised Residence Questionnaire indicates that he had been absent Canada for 300 days, and this matches what appears in his "3 passports";
• The client's ex-wife and three children, his two brothers and his sister are in Canada. Other members of his family are in Egypt and France;
• During the hearing, the client stated that since 1999, he has always lived in Canada but would travel to France on occasion for business;
• During the hearing, the client was very cooperative and was aware he was under oath; and
• The client has his children's best interests in mind.
