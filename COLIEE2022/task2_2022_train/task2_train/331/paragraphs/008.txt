On September 26, 2007, the IAD allowed the Respondent's appeal on grounds that humanitarian and compassionate considerations including the best interests of children warranted granting special relief in the circumstances. However, the IAD found that, on the evidence before it, the Respondent's primary residence from May 1999 to May 2004 was France, and that the reason for his many absences from Canada was his intent to continue business operations in France. In addition, the IAD found no reliable evidence supporting the Respondent's claim that he had tried to establish himself in Canada since his landing or had made a reasonable attempt to return to Canada at the first opportunity.
