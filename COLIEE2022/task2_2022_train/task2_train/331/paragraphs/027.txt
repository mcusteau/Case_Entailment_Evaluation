Apart from the above factors considered by the Judge, there was other evidence before her which supported the contention that the Respondent had not established residency in Canada in the applicable time period. Both the Citizenship Officer who referred the matter to the Judge and the IAD concluded that residency had not been established by the Respondent in the applicable time period. The IAD cited the Respondent's April 17, 2002 affidavit before the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench, wherein he attests that, "[W] hile I am still residing in France, I do verily believe that it is reasonable for me to have access to the children several times per year." It is true that the record before the IAD is not the same as the record before the Judge, however, both proceedings dealt with the Respondent's establishment in Canada.
