A two-stage inquiry exists with respect to the residency requirements of paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act. Mme Justice Layden-Stevenson described the approach to be followed in
Goudimenko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
[2002] FCT 447, at paragraph 13:
At the first stage, the threshold determination is made as to whether or not, and when, residence in Canada has been established. If residence has not been established, the matter ends there. If the threshold has been met, the second stage of the inquiry requires a determination of whether or not the particular applicant's residency satisfies the required total days of residence. It is with respect to the second stage of the inquiry, and particularly with regard to whether absences can be deemed residence, that the divergence of opinion in the Federal Court exists.
