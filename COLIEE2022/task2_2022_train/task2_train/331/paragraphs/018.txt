[18]
Whether an applicant meets the residency requirement involves a question of mixed fact and law. On such questions Citizenship Judges are owed a degree of deference by reason of their special knowledge and expertise in these matters. The jurisprudence of this Court has established the applicable standard of review for such a question to be reasonableness.
