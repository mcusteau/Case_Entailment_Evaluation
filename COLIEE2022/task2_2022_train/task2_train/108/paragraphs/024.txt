  With respect to the merits of the appeal, the letter received from Mr. Blondahl in May 2006 does not address, as mentioned, the merits of the case in any way and the Office of the Commissioner did not request a copy of the Minister's file (although there is no evidence on file in this respect, the Court was advised by the applicant that the practice of the Commissioner is to request this file only if, and when, an extension has been granted). It is thus most surprising that in such circumstances the letter of June 12, 2006 does not request Mr. Blondahl to provide any details in this respect, or at the very least, that he forward his most relevant medical evidence in support of his appeal. It would therefore be good practice for the Commissioner to ensure that a prospective appellant is requested to comment on the merits of his or her appeal in the request for an extension. Without any evidence as to the merits of a prospective appeal, it can hardly be argued that the Commissioner has really applied the test (whether or not that factor is ultimately found to be determinative).
