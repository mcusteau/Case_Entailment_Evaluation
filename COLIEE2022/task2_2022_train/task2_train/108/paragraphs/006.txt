  The hearing proceeded ex parte given that the respondent, Mr. Blondahl, had failed to file within the time allotted for this, not only in the  
 Federal Courts Rules 
 , SOR/98-106 but also in a specific order of Justice Michael Beaudry ( 
 Canada (A.G.) v. Blondahl 
  (August 29, 2008), Ottawa T-1426-06), his notice of appearance and application record. On the morning of the hearing, Mr. Blondahl's counsel attempted again to file an application record, motion which was strongly opposed by the Attorney General. In the interest of justice, the Court found that it was preferable to proceed immediately, without any further adjournment, on the merits of the application, even if this meant not having the benefit of Mr. Blondahl's submissions.
