  Mr. Blondahl responded to this request in a letter dated June 19, 2006 in which he chronicles his longstanding depression, pathological anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and stress. In essence, Mr. Blondahl explains that the refusal of his application sent him into "a tailspin" from which only then, with the help of medication, had he emerged sufficiently to pursue his appeal of the Minister's decision. On July 4, 2006, the Commissioner granted the request to extend the appeal deadline, based on Mr. Blondahl's account of his affliction with chronic pathological anxiety disorder.
