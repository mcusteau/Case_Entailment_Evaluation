  This file has a somewhat tortuous procedural history. Although it was instituted August 8, 2006 (the Minister was notified of the decision to grant the extension on or about July 6, 2006), the hearing was delayed for a variety of reasons including orders sought in respect of the adjournment of this and other files, involving similar issues, that is the test to be applied by the Commissioner to determine whether or not an extension of the time should be granted, its duty to provide reasons, etc. The adjournments were pending the determination of an application in  
 Canada (A.G.) v. Pentney  
 (file T-645-06), in which the Commissioner was granted intervening status. Although judgment was granted in that file on January 25, 2008 ( 
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Pentney 
  (2008), 322 F.T.R. 181; 2008 FC 96 ( 
 Pentney 
 )), the other two remaining files proceeded more quickly than the present one ( 
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Schneider 
 , [2008] F.T.R. Uned. 677; 169 A.C.W.S.(3d) 444; 2008 FC 764, file T-614-07 and  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Berhe 
  (2008), 333 F.T.R. 140; 2008 FC 967, file T-1655-06).
