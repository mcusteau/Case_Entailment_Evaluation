 [11] 
  In his affidavit before Justice Lemieux in  
 Pentney 
 , cited at para. 18 of that decision, the Commissioner indicated that in considering whether or not to exercise his discretion to extend the appeal deadline, he turned his mind to the factors which had been identified by Justice Judith A. Snider in  
 Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v. Gattellaro 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. A29; 140 A.C.W.S.(3d) 576; 2005 FC 883 ( 
 Gattellaro 
 ) to be taken into account by the Pension Appeals Board in the exercise of their discretion to grant extensions of time. Justice Lemieux found that this four part test disclosed factors which were equally, albeit not exclusively, relevant for consideration by the Commissioner in the determining whether or not to exercise his discretion. Thus, the Commissioner in fact had identified in his mind the appropriate test which he had to apply in the circumstances of that case.
