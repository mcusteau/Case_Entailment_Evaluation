Clearly there is a balance to be struck between the objectives reflected in paragraphs (f) and (g) quoted above and those reflected in paragraphs (i) and (j). On the facts of this matter, I am satisfied that the balance has been skewed to an unreasonable extent in favour of objectives (i) and (j) without any evidence being provided to the Court that those objectives have been diligently pursued in dealing with the situation of the principal applicant and his family members. In the result, my decision will include a declaration to the following effect:
"It is hereby declared that, on the facts of this matter as summarized in reasons given for this order, the respondent has failed to properly balance the immigration objectives reflected in paragraphs 3(f) and (g) of the
Immigration Act
with those reflected in paragraphs 3(i) and (j) by failing to diligently and effectively pursue the application for landed immigrant status of the principal applicant, Nassim Mohammad Popal and of the members of his family who are co-applicants in this application, while at the same time failing to act diligently to protect the safety and good order of Canadian society and to promote international order and justice by denying the use of Canadian territory to persons who are likely to engage in criminal activity."
