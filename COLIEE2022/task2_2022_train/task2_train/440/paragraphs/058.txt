It is well established that, in order for a question to be certified pursuant to subsection 83(1) of the
Immigration Act
, it must be a question which transcends the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation and contemplates issues of broad significance or general application. In addition, it must be a question that is determinative of the appeal. [see footnote 10] More recently, the Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that where a question is certified, the Court of Appeal is not limited to addressing only the certified question and issues related to it. In
Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
[see footnote 11], the Supreme Court wrote:
"The certification of a 'question of general importance' is the trigger by which an appeal is justified. The object of the appeal is still the judgment itself, not the certified question."
