Notices of seizure of the principal applicant's identity booklet and marriage certificate indicate that "feedback" on the seized documents was requested, presumably from "Intelligence". In the event, the identity documents were never forwarded to "Intelli足gence" for verification of the respondent's concerns. Material before the Court indicates that this failure to seek verification or "feed足back" was not discovered and disclosed to the principal applicant for many, many months. As late as the 21st of January, 2000, in response to written questions posed to the respondent's affiant in this matter, the affiant replied:
"The documents that were seized were fowarded to our Regional Intelligence Office on September 14, 1998 and feed足back was requested as to the erasures and information that was written over the documents. I have not received any feed足back to date."
No feedback was received because, in truth, the documents were never submitted for verification or feedback.
