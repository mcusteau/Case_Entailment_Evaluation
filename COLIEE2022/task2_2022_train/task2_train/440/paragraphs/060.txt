Certification of the first question in effect makes certification of the second and third proposed questions superfluous. That is not to say that I regard the second and third questions as being other than questions of broad significance or general application. But I am concerned that either of the second or third questions would not, of itself, be dispositive of an appeal in this matter. Further, the third question presupposes a purpose in retaining seized documents that had no evidentiary basis before me. There was simply nothing before the Court to indicate that the seized documents that continued to be retained by the respondent at the time of the hearing of this matter were being held to facilitate the potential future removal of the principal applicant. The only purpose for the seizure and detention of the documents disclosed in the evidence before the Court was for purposes of verification of their authenticity.
