In a response to written questions, the respondent's affiant disclosed the following text received the 24th of June, 1999 from a visa officer for the respondent at Islamabad:
"This refers to your e-mail addressed to Islamabad concerning the above-named [presumably, the principal applicant]. Our file B033894195. Sorry you didn't quote your file number.
"Marriage Certificates in Afghanistan and Pakistan are completed, generally by the "Mullah" who is authorized to perform marriages under the Muslim Law. Mullahs are usually self-selected volunteers who, while they have a good knowledge of the Coran, most are uneducated. To see Nikah Nama (marriage certificate) with erasures and white-out areas is a common occur­rence. They are also very often incomplete and contain wrong information, neverthe­less they are genuine.
"In the case of the Afghans, your client has two more documents than the majority of the Afghans we interview here. Very often, the relationship is established by inquisitive interviews on the knowledge of each other, family photos. For the last 20 years, docu­ments from Afghanistan are almost inexist­ant. ID cards have no more weight than the word of the applicant.
"In this particular case, it is true that we have accepted the documents as submitted. We have no means to verify the authentic­ity of documents from Afghanistan. The interviewing officer, who is no longer at this post, simply wrote that the relationship was established. The interview was more to determine the eligibility of overaged dependents.
"Having said this, this application has been dragging for more than 4 years now and we would like to conclude it as soon as possible. They have been through medical examination twice and the last results are expired: however, should you land the HOF, we will issue visa without further medicals as per A46.04(3)."
