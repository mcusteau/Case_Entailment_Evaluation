I am satisfied that it is now beyond doubt that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain an application such as this under section 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
[see footnote 5]. In
Krause et al. v. Canada et al.
[see footnote 6], Mr. Justice Stone, for the Court, wrote at paragraph 21:
"The appellants point out that the drafters of section 18.1 employed language else­where in its text which, in their sub­mission, is designed to accommodate an application for both a section 18 remedy per se and such other remedy as is pro­vided for in subsection 18.1(3). Thus in subsection 18.1(1), the words 'anyone directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought' appear. The Motions judge ... was of the view that the word 'matter' as repeated in former Rule 1602 is 'reflective ... of the necessity to find a word to cover a variety of adminis­trative actions.' I respectfully agree. Fur­ther support for that view was expressed after Bill C-38 which proposed this change was adopted, but before it came into force. Indeed, it seems to me that the word 'mat­ter' does embrace not only a 'decision or order' but any matter in respect of which a remedy may be available under section 18 of the
Federal Court Act
." (citation omitted)
At paragraph 23, Mr. Justice Stone wrote:
"In my view, the time limit imposed by subsection 18.1(2) does not bar the appel­lants from seeking relief by way of mandamus, prohibition and declaration."
Finally, at paragraph 24, the Court wrote:
"I am satisfied that the exercise of the jurisdiction under section 18 does not depend on the existence of a 'decision or order'."
