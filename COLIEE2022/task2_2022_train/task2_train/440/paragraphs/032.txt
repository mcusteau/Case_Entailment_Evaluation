The interview of the principal applicant on the 20th of April, 1998 is of critical importance to my determination herein. The only sworn evidence that is before the Court as to what transpired at that interview comes from the principal applicant himself. The interviewing officer's notes of the interview, contained in the tribunal record, are to the following effect:
"Unable to land subject this date as identi­fication presented unacceptable. He pres­ented Afghanistani driver's license which does not provide proof of citizenship, country of birth or date of birth. He also presented an Afghanistani passport which was issued in New York in March 1996.
He stated that this passport was issued on the basis of his Canadian social insurance card
