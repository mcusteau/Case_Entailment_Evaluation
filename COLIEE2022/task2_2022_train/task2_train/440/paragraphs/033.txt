The principal applicant attests that he was handed a letter at the close of the inter­view. A copy of the letter is an exhibit to his affidavit and a further copy appears in the tribunal record. It is a form letter in which "Xs" have been placed in boxes beside the following statements: "You have not pres­ented sufficient identification"; and "Further processing is required." The letter provides no further explanation or guidance to the principal applicant. More particularly, no reasons whatsoever are provided as to why the identity documentation presented by the principal applicant was determined to be insufficient. This, despite the fact that the form letter provided space for such an expla­nation.
