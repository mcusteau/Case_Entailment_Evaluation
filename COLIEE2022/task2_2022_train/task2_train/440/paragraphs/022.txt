The situation of the principal applicant herein and his family is apparently far from unique although, arguably at least, and cer­tainly in the view of an officer of the re­spondent's ministry in Islamabad, it is distin­guishable from that of many persons deter­mined to be Convention refugees who find themselves in Canada in similar situations. Certainly not all of those who find them­selves in similar situations to the principal applicant will have a spouse, and children who are inexorably aging and therefore losing dependant status in relation to their father, in what the principal applicant describes as "deplorable conditions", outside of this country. Not all families of similarly situated persons will have been separated in the manner in which this family finds itself.
