[28]
All of the foregoing being said, it is the action, or inaction of the respondent in failing to land the principal applicant under subsection 46.04 of the
Immigration Act
and, on the basis thereof, to issue immigrant visas to the other applicants herein that is under review in this application, not the treatment of the principal applicant under the UCRCC and any failure to lay an effective foundation in the five years preceding the principal applicant's claim to qualify as a member of that class.
