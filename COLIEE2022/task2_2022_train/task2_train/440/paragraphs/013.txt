On or about the 14th of September, 1998, the respondent wrote to the applicant to advise that the additional identity docu­mentation he had submitted was not satisfac­tory, that the respondent was stopping the processing on his immigration file, and that his identity booklet and marriage certificate had been seized pursuant to subsection 110­(2) of the
Immigration Act
. While the principal applicant's expired Afghan passport and Afghan driver's licence were apparently not formally seized, they were not returned to him. Material from the remarkably sparse tribunal record on this application indicates that both the marriage certificate and the identity booklet submitted by the principal applicant
"... contain alteration (sic) which render them unacceptable for the purposes of A46.04.
"The marriage certificate contains white-out (sic) and write-overs in the age at time of marriage section.
"The Identity Document has erasures and overwriting ...
"Documents will be seized and forwarded to Intelligence for review and observation."
