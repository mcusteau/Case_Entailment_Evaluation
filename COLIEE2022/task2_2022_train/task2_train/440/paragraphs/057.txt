[57]
Counsel for the respondent proposed three questions as follows:
"1. Does the time bar in ss. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, or ss. 82.1(3) of the
Immigration Act
, apply so as to bar the grant of relief in the nature of certiorari in an application for judicial review against a 'course of conduct'.
"2. Is a passport, however issued by an applicant's country of citizenship, sufficient for the purposes of ss. 46.04(8) of the
Immigration Act
, or may an immigration officer have reference to the underlying process for issuance in determining whether to accept it for the purposes of the subsection?
"3. Is it a reviewable error for an immigration officer to retain documents seized under ss. 110 of the
Immigration Act
in order to facilitate the carrying out of any provisions of the
Immigration Act
or
Regulations
, including the potential future removal of the document holder, and then not to submit those documents for verification where their authenticity may be in doubt?"
