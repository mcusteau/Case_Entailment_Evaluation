[54]
Counsel for the applicants urged that, on the particular facts of this matter, there can be found special reasons for ordering costs in favour of the principal applicant. Counsel urged that those costs should be fixed in the amount of $4,000. Counsel for the respondent urged that there are no special reasons for an order of costs on this application. I favour the view of counsel for the applicant as to the existence of special reasons. The record before the Court discloses a lack of sensitivity and responsiveness to the interests of the principal applicant and his family members which appears only to have been alleviated, and then only partially and reluctantly, by the institution of this application. That being said, I will order that costs be payable by the respondent to the principal applicant fixed in the amount of $2,000.00, inclusive of disbursements.
