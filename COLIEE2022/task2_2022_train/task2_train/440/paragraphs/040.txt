The bases on which officials of the Afghan government choose to issue passports is a matter for that government. The basis on which the principal applicant's passport, apparently valid in the view of the Afghani officials in New York, and subsisting at the time the notarized copy of the passport was submitted, might not have been "satisfactory" to officials in the respondent's ministry, but that is not the test. Subsection 46.04(8) of the
Immigration Act
speaks only of a "valid and subsisting" passport, not a valid and subsisting passport issued on a basis "satis­factory" to the respondent. The term "satis­factory" in that subsection modifies only "identity document[s]" other than valid and subsisting passports and travel documents. I am satisfied that this interpretation is sup­ported by reference to the french language version of subsection 46.04(8).
