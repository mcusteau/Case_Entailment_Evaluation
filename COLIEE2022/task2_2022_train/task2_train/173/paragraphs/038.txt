  The Applicants submit that in so framing the issues, the RPD implicitly communicated that it was not concerned with whether (i) the Applicants could seek state protection if the FARC targeted them, (ii) there was an internal flight alternative available to the Applicants within Colombia, or (iii) conditions in Colombia had changed since the Applicants fled that country, such that the FARC was no longer in a position to target them. The Applicants further submit that, after having implicitly communicated to them that it was not concerned with these three issues, it was a breach of fairness and natural justice for the RPD to then reject their claims on the basis of conclusions reached with respect to these issues.
