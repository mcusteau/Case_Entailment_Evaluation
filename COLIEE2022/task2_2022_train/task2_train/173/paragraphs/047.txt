  In contrast to the situation in  
 Bouaouni v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FC 1211, the RPD did not fail to analyse the Applicants' claims under section 97. Rather, it analysed them together with their claims under section 96, which is permissible ( 
 Sida v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2004 FC 901, at para. 15).
