  The RPD specifically addressed important information contained in Dr. Chernick's report that was inconsistent with its decision, at paragraphs 31, 32, 35 and 36 of its decision. However, it preferred other recent evidence, including two reports by International Crisis Group (ICG), dated April 2008 and March 2009, which were extensively summarized at paragraphs 38 and 39 of its decision. The RPD noted that ICG "is guided by well known and respected international personalities, including a former Prime Minister of Canada and an internationally recognized Canadian jurist." Having specifically discussed the Chernick report, as well as a significant amount of other evidence submitted by the Applicants, and having explained why it did not accept much of that evidence, it was reasonably open to the RPD to prefer other evidence, all of which was fairly recent. In addition to the 2008 and 2009 ICG reports, other authoritative sources relied upon by the RPD included the United States Department of State's 2008 report on Columbia, dated February 25, 2009, and a report of the UNHCHR, dated February 29, 2008.
