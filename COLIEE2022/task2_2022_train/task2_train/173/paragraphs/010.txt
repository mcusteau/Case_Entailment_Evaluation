  After he refused to comply with that demand, he claims that he was stopped the following month at a FARC road block. Upon presenting his documents, he was told that the commander wanted to speak with him. He was detained for approximately 45 minutes before three men arrived and took him for a walk for about an hour. During that walk, he was told that he had mocked the FARC after they had requested his cooperation. The men then demanded that he provide them with information about the families that he drove and that he help them to deliver merchandise during the day when he was not transporting children. When he replied that he could not assist them, he claims that he was beaten and suffered injuries to his leg and clavicle. He then agreed to assist them and was released and told to await further contact from them.
