  It is well established that a stay of proceedings should not be granted unless it can be shown that (1) the continuation of the action would cause prejudice or injustice, not merely inconvenience or additional expense, to the defendant, and (2) that the stay would not be unjust to the plaintiff. The onus is on the party requesting the stay to prove that these conditions exist:  
 Discreet Logic Inc. v. Registrar of Copyrights (Can.) et al. 
  (1993), 51 C.P.R.(3d) 191 (F.C.T.D.), at 191. In this case, Compuoffice has failed to demonstrate that continuation of the expungement proceeding would result in such prejudice or injustice. I am of this opinion despite the very thorough and able arguments of Compuoffice's counsel.
