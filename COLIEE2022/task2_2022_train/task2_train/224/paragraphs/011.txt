  Compulife further argues that Parliament intended that a process be available whereby the issue of registrability could be determined on a summary basis, in addition to any remedy which may be sought for infringement. It did so by way of s. 57 of the  
 Act 
 . Moreover, the  
 Federal Court Rules 
  provide for a more expedited proceeding, involving the exchange of affidavit evidence and examinations. Compulife argues that it should not be denied its statutory right to proceed under s. 57, at this time. To do so would also prevent it from moving forward the proceedings before the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations.
