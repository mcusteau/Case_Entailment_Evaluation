  It was submitted that the officer's decision was unreasonable in light of the reasonable explanation provided by the applicant with regards to her past stays in Canada. The applicant argued that the officer failed to take into account that throughout her previous stay in Canada, the applicant undertook to maintain valid TRV status and promptly left when her request for an extension was refused. It was submitted that the officer acted unfairly in failing to balance the factors described in  
 Baker 
  v.  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, and instead made the applicant's previous TRV determinative of this application. Failure to consider the applicant's entire application for a work permit with regards to the entire factual context is a breach of the visa officer's duty of fairness ( 
 Akhbari 
  v.  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.C.J. No. 1773).
