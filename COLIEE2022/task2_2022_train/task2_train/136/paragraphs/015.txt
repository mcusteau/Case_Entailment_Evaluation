  With regards to the departmental guidelines set out in Immigration Manual OP 14, the respondent submitted that although live-in caregivers may have dual intent for immigrating to Canada, some workers do not in the end apply for permanent residency. Since there is no prima facie assumption that they will in fact apply for permanent residency, they are still required to meet the requirement imposed on workers. It was submitted that in rendering a positive decision, an officer should be satisfied that the applicant will not stay in Canada illegally once their authorized stay has expired in accordance with the guidelines. The respondent submitted that the officer legitimately refused the work permit given the applicant's past history of not respecting the terms and conditions of her TRV and that she had not established from the contents of her application or submissions at the interview, that she would leave at the end of her stay if the application was not allowed.
