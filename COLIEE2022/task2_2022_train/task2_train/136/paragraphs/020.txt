 Issue 2 
 
 
 
 Did the visa officer err in finding that the applicant failed to meet the conditions of her previous Temporary Resident Visa? 
 
 
 
 As I read the visa officer's decision, his reason for rejecting the application was that he was not satisfied that the applicant would leave Canada when required to do so.
