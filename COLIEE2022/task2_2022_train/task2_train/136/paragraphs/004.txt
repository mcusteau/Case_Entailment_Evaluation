  The applicant had previously been issued a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) so that she could attend her brother's wedding in Canada. Before the issuance of that permit, the applicant had expressed that her intended purpose for travel to Canada was to travel with her parents for a month and to attend her brother's wedding to be held on September 11, 2004. However, the applicant stated at the June 21, 2007 interview, that she in fact did not attend her brother's wedding because her daughter was ill. Instead, the applicant travelled to Canada in November 2004 without her parents. During her stay in Canada, she was offered employment from her sister as a live-in caregiver. While finalizing the details of her work permit application, it appears that the applicant undertook to extend her visitor status while in Canada as it was set to expire on or about May 12, 2005. The applicant's request for an extension was denied on May 22, 2005 and she left Canada on June 1, 2005. It appears that the applicant's first work permit application, made while she was in Canada, was eventually denied.
