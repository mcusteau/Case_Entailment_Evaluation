  This is because persons who make such applications have no accrued or accruing rights until all of the conditions precedent to the exercise of the right they hope to obtain under the application have been fulfilled ( 
 R. v Puskas 
 , [1998] 1 SCR 1207, at para 14;  
 Apotex Inc v Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1994] 1 FC 742, at paras 56-63 (CA);  
 Scott v College of Physicians & Surgeons of Saskatchewan 
  [1992] SJ No 432, at 718 (CA);  
 Kazi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FC 948, at para 19;  
 Gustavson Drilling 
 , above). Until a final decision has been made on the application, the applicant simply has potential future rights that remain to be determined ( 
 Bell Canada v Palmer 
  [1974] 1 FC 186, at paras 12-15 (CA) [ 
 Palmer 
 ];  
 McAllister v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1996] 2 FC 190, at paras 53-54);  
 Chu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 893, at paras 67-68). Stated alternatively, the applicant has no more than a hope that the application will be successful. There are no rights that may be retroactively or retrospectively affected by a change in the test applicable to spousal sponsorship applications. To the extent that this Court's decision in  
 McDoom v. Canada (Minister of Manpower and Immigration) 
  [1978] 1 FC 323, which dealt with a significantly different legislative regime, stands for the contrary position, I respectfully decline to follow that decision.
