  With respect to Mr. Gill's credibility, the IAD also made an adverse finding based on his denial of the events that formed the basis for his conviction of assault causing bodily harm to his first wife. It made that finding after considering the findings of the sentencing court. In addition, the IAD found that Mr. Gill was "often evasive in answering questions on cross-examination" and that he "frequently had to be asked a question repeatedly in an effort to obtain a responsive answer."
