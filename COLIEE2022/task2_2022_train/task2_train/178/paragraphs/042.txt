  At first blush, the Respondent's position that the IAD must apply the law as it stands  
 at the time of its decision 
  would appear to be correct. That position was endorsed by this Court in  
 Macdonald v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2012 FC 978, at paras 22-25 and  
 Wiesehahan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 858, at para 54). However, in those cases, the visa officer and the IAD each determined that the applicant had failed to establish both of the tests in section 4. As a result, the fact that section 4 was changed from a conjunctive test to a disjunctive test between the time of the visa officer's decision and the time of the IAD's decision had no particular significance.
