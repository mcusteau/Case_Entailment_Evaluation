  Continuing acts or decisions may be reviewed under s. 18.1 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  without offending Rule 1602(4) (now Rule 302), however the acts in question must not involve two different factual situations, two different types of relief sought, and two different decision-making bodies ( 
 Mahmood v. Canada et al. 
  (1998), 154 F.T.R. 102 (T.D.); reconsideration refused, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1836 (T.D.)). At paragraph 10, Mr. Justice Muldoon stated as follows: 
 
 
 
 "While the rule states that only one decision may be attacked, the Trial Division has also recognized that continuing 'acts' or decisions may also be reviewed under s. 18.1 of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  without contravening rule 1602(4) (see for example  
 Puccini v. Canada (Department of Agriculture) 
 , [1993] 3 F.C. 557). However, in those cases, the acts in question were of a continuing nature, making it difficult for the applicant to pinpoint a single decision from which relief could be sought by this Court. They did not involve, as in the facts here, two different fact situations, two different types of relief sought and two different decision-making bodies. [The former rule 1602(4) provided that the notice of motion 'shall be in respect of a single decision, order or other matter only' with the exception of a no credible basis claim and a subsequent removal order under the  
 Immigration Act
