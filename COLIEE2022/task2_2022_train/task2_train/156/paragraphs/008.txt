  (1998), 157 F.T.R. 44 (T.D.), the Court allowed several taxpayers who received related demands for information from the Minister to join as applicants in one judicial review proceeding challenging the demands as the issues raised by the Applicants were essentially the same, even though the factual issues underlying the demands differed in minor respects.
