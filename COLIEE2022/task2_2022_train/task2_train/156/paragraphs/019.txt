  In my opinion, the distinctions between the two decisions as argued by the Respondents do not outweigh the similarities, the distinctions are not so complex as to create confusion, and to require two separate judicial review applications to be made, given the similarities, would be a waste of time and effort. In my view, whether the May shipment in fact involves a "decision", or whether any issues related to it are moot, are questions to be answered at the judicial review hearing.
