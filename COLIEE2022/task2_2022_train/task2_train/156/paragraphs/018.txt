  In my opinion, the Applicants should be allowed to contest both decisions within one application for judicial review because: both decisions were made by a decision-maker acting in the capacity of Acting Operations manager of the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate of Health Canada for western Canada; both decision-makers acted on the basis that Empowerplus is a drug and the shipments were commercial importations in violation of the personal importation policy of Health Canada; both decisions involve a legal challenge based on the infringement of the same  
 Charter 
  rights, the legality of the seizures, and the definition of "drug" in the  
 Food and Drugs Act 
 ; and allegations are made respecting both decisions.
