  The original Notice of Application, dated May 28, 2003, sought judicial review of five decisions by Health Canada. The Applicants now wish to file an Amended Notice of Application, in which they have narrowed down their challenge to two decisions by Health Canada to order the seizure and detention of Empowerplus, a dietary supplement, being shipped to Canada. They allege that the seizures were made by Health Canada on or about April 22, 2003 in respect of a shipment of Empowerplus dated April 17, 2003, and on or about May 21, 2003 in respect of a shipment of Empowerplus dated May 16, 2003. The shipments will be referred to as the "April shipment" and the "May shipment" respectively.
