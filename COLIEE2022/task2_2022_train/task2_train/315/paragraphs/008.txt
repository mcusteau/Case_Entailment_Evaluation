In my view, if such a reversal is to be contemplated or ordered, it must be for the purpose of achieving the least expensive and most expeditious determination of the issues on the merits in a manner that remains just.

The Court being satisfied that such an order would achieve the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of the proceeding is the primary requirement, and one which the moving party has the burden of establishing. Whether or not the order should be made in the circumstances remains a matter for the Court's discretion.
