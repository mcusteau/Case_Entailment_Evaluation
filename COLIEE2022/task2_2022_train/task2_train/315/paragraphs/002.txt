It has been observed that proceedings under the
Regulations
are getting more and more complex and lengthy, both in terms of prosecution and in terms of hearing time, to the point where hearings on the merits taking place within the last six months of the 24-month statutory stay are becoming the rule rather than the exception, and where it is routine that hearings last three days or more. To the undersigned's knowledge, no such application appears to have been heard on the merits without having had to be designated as a specially managed proceeding and, more often than not, they have required significant interlocutory and scheduling hearings. Notices of allegations are getting lengthier, and in particular, allegations of invalidity are getting lengthier and more complex. Once an allegation of invalidity is made, an Applicant is almost compelled to file evidence, and its best evidence, on every single ground of invalidity alleged, whether or not the Respondent will ever lead evidence on that aspect. And whether or not the Respondent mounts an independent case on any of its invalidity allegations, it may still, and too often feels compelled to file evidence merely aiming to undermine, contradict or attack the credibility of the Applicant's affiants. Thus, secondary issues are often blown out of proportion, consuming the parties' and the Court's resources, and extending the time required for the hearing and determination of the application on its merits. Although fortunately many of those issues get abandoned prior to the hearing on the merits, they will still have contributed in multiplying the number of experts thought to be necessary by the parties, the time required to schedule and conduct their cross-examinations and often, the time and resources of the parties and of the Court in dealing with interlocutory motions arising from this evidence.
