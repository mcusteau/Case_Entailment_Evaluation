I recognize that there is an undeniable tactical advantage accruing to the party, whoever it might be, who files its evidence second. That party not only gets to file its evidence in substantially the way it had anticipated to present and shape it, but has the added advantage of having the opportunity to adapt it so that it best opposes its opponent's; in the absence of any independent evidence of its own, that party also has the opportunity of weakening and attacking directly its opponent's evidence and mining its credibility. These are tactical advantages, which although legitimate, are neither substantive nor procedural. Such tactical advantages, it is hoped at least, should not in the end determine the outcome of the proceedings.
