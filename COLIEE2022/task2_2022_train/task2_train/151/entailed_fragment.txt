Our Court, applying this approach to PRRA procedure, decided that section 113 of the  
 IRPA 
  and section 167 of the  
 IRPR 
 , while not conferring a hearing in every case, are consistent with the principles of fundamental justice and that they do not breach the fundamental rights provided under section 7 of the  
 Charter
