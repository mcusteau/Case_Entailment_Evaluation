  Mr. Valère was not alone in opposing corruption within the HNP. He testified that two of his police colleagues shared his values, and also stood up against corruption within the force. These two colleagues were killed - one in 1997, and the other in 1999. Both deaths were attributed to drug traffickers, and both remained unsolved. Mr. Valère believes that his colleagues were killed because they refused to be corrupted.
