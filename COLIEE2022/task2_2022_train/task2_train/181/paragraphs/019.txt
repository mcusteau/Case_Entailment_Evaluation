  The determination of whether someone has been complicit in crimes against humanity is essentially a factual question that needs to be examined on a case by case basis. There is, however, a considerable body of jurisprudence emanating from the Federal Court of Appeal which establishes certain general principles to be followed in making such a determination. These cases include the  
 Ramirez 
 ,  
 Moreno 
  and  
 Harb 
  decisions previously cited, as well as  
 Sivakumar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1994] 1 F.C. 433; 163 N.R. 197 (F.C.A.) and  
 Bazargan v. Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration 
  (1996), 205 N.R. 282 (F.C.A.).
