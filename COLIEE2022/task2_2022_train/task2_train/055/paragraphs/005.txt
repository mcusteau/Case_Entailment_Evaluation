  Where a question of jurisdiction was at issue, the approach of the court has been expressed by Thurlow, A.C.J. (as he then was), in  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Cumming 
 , [1980] 2 F.C. 122 (T.D.), at pages 132-133: 
 
 
 
 "The preferable course for the court is to leave the Tribunal free to carry out its inquiries and not to prohibit it save in a case where it is clear and beyond doubt that the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to deal with the matter before it." 
 
 
 
 I think it follows that if substantial deference by the court is applicable when questions of jurisdiction are at issue, at least the same degree of deference if not more, would be applicable to other types of decisions under s. 41 e.g., discretionary, factual or even mixed fact and law decisions.
