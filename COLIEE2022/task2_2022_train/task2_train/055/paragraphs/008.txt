  With respect to the alternative procedure available, the Commission's decision states that no other review procedures currently available to the complainant are more appropriate than the complaint process to resolve the complaint. The staff reports states at p. 7: 
 
 
 
 "Given the nature and the importance of the issues involved, the respondent's submission has not demonstrated that a labour relations procedure such as arbitration would provide a forum which would be more appropriate to examine and discuss these issues, if it were appropriate, than would the complaint process. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "In spite of this, the respondent's submission provides no indication of how the allegations contained in the complaint could be examined and, if necessary, remedied through that review procedure in a more timely fashion than through the CHRC's complaint process." 
 
 
 
 Contrary to the submissions of CPC, it is clear the Commission did put its mind to the arbitration alternative and considered relevant factors. CPC says the Commission should not have dealt with the appropriateness of the arbitration alternative. However, in making a decision whether a grievance or review procedure otherwise reasonably available ought to be exhausted, the appropriateness of the alternative is an obvious consideration. This is a relevant factor for the discretionary decision that the Commission is called upon to make. While one might question why a labour relations procedure is not equally or more appropriate than a human rights process for dealing with the issue of pay equity (especially since the Commission in 1991 dismissed the 1982 pay equity complaint while the matter had still not been resolved), this was for the Commission to decide. Weighing the appropriateness of one process or another cannot be said to be irrelevant.
