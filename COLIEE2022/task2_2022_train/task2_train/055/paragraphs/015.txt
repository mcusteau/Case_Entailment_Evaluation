  I have gone to some length to deal with the issue of bad faith because it would appear, at least on the material before me, that there is some substance to it and that another decision-maker might have come to a different conclusion than did the Commission here. However, it has not been demonstrated that the Commission has taken account of irrelevant considerations, failed to take account of relevant ones, or itself has acted in bad faith.
