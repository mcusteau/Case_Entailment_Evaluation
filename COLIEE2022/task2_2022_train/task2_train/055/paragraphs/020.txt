  From the ongoing litigation, it is apparent that the pay equity issue has not yet been resolved and that there is no prospect of an early resolution on the horizon. For whatever reason, the parties have not moved the matter forward more rapidly. It would be presumptuous of me to attribute motives or fault on either of them without more information. However, the Commission has allowed itself to become a participant in this extraordinary delay of a matter which arose some fifteen years ago and which the parties agreed, twelve years ago, that resolution was necessary and would take place.
