  The question of whether the Commission should have refused to deal with the complaint on the grounds that the applicant ought to have exhausted grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available calls for two decisions by the Commission. In  
 Latif v. Canadian Human Rights Commission and Fairweather 
 , [1980] 1 F.C. 687; 28 N.R. 494 (F.C.A.). Le Dain, J.A., at p. 698 [F.C.] states: 
 
 
 
 "... whether there is a grievance or review procedure 'reasonably available' is a question of law or mixed law and fact, but whether the complainant 'ought' to exhaust the procedure is a question of opinion or discretion." 
 
 
 
 In this case, there is no dispute that there was an alternative procedure reasonably available when the 1992/1993 complaint was filed. Whether it ought to have been exhausted is a discretionary decision. The question of bad faith on the part of CPAA is one of mixed law and fact. (See  
 Latif 
 , supra, at p. 698). In other circumstances, such a decision possibly offers more scope for judicial intervention than a discretionary decision. However, for the reasons given, judicial review of both decisions of the Commission in this case are constrained by the narrow scope for review mandated by the words of s. 41 and the approaches outlined in  
 Williams 
  and  
 Cumming 
 .
