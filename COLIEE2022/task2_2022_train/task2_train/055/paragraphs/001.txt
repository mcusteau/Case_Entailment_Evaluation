 Rothstein, J. 
 : The applicant, Canada Post Corporation (CPC), seeks an order quashing a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (Commission) dated October 25, 1994 made under s. 41 of the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, wherein the Commission decided to deal with a 1992 complaint which was amended in 1993 (the 1992/1993 complaint) of the Canadian Postmasters and Assistants Association (CPAA) respecting pay equity. The applicant asks the court to direct the Commission not to deal with the complaint, relying on ss. 41(a) and (d) of the  
 Act 
 . Section 41 provides: 
 
 
 
 "41. Subject to s. 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that 
 
 
 
 (a)  
 the alleged victim of the discriminatory practice to which the complaint relates ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available; 
 
 
 
 (b) the complaint is one that could more appropriately be dealt with, initially or completely, according to a procedure provided for under an Act of Parliament other than this Act; 
 
 
 
 (c) the complaint is beyond the jurisdiction of the Commission; 
 
 
 
 (d)  
 the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith 
 ; or 
 
 
 
 (e) the complaint is based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period of time as the Commission considers appropriate in the circumstances, before receipt of the complaint." (emphasis added) 
 
 
 
 The applicant submits that the Commission should have decided not to deal with the 1992/1993 complaint because the CPAA ought to have exhausted the grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available and because the 1992/1993 complaint was made in bad faith.
