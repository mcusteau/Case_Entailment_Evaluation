  As I have indicated, CPAA also argued that the 1992/1993 complaint is somehow different from the 1982 complaint and therefore covers matters not contemplated by the 1982 complaint and the 1985 agreement. This has not been demonstrated to me. The issue is and always has been pay equity. As I read the 1985 agreement, it addresses the issue in very broad terms and indeed any job evaluation plan was to be submitted to the Commission to seek its approval that it met the requirements of the  
 Act 
 . I do not find these arguments of CPAA and the Commission persuasive. Nonetheless, the Commission's staff report came to a different conclusion: 
 
 
 
 "34. The review procedure described in clause 5 of the Supplementary Memorandum of Settlement would focus on disputes with respect to the development, application or implementation of a job evaluation plan: pay equity investigations focus on matters which include but are broader than job evaluation, such as the comparisons of job value and wages for the application of s. 11 of the  
 CHRA 
 , as well as issues under s. 10. 
 
 
 
 "35. The respondent has not demonstrated that the arbitration would be capable of protecting members of the CPAA from the alleged discriminatory practices described in the complaint, or that the remedies available under this review procedure could compensate them, if necessary, or provide broader or preventive measures." 
 
 
 
 As I have indicated, on the basis of the arguments made before me, I would not agree with this conclusion. Nonetheless, the agreement was clearly considered. I cannot say that the Commission's conclusion that CPAA was not acting in bad faith was made by it having ignored evidence.
