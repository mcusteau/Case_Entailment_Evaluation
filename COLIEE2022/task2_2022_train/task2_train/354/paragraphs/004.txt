By letter dated November 17, 1997, the applicant filed a second request for cancellation of interest. Mr. Young reviewed the request and made a recommendation to Mr. Beaulac, Director of the Ottawa Tax Services Office, Department of National Revenue. By letter dated December 9, 1997, Mr. Beaulac advised the applicant that the interest arrears which accumulated subsequent to the reassessments of July 21, 1997 in the amount of $314.40 were cancelled, but that the remainder of interest was still owing as the applicant's circumstances were not appropriate to justify the cancellation or waiver of interest.
