  It is settled law that mere membership in an organization involved in international offences is not sufficient to exclude a claimant. Moreover, complicity between the applicant and the organization in question must be established (Ramirez v. Canada (M.E.I.), [1992] F.C.J. No. 109 (F.C.A.)). To establish this complicity, the claimant must have a shared common purpose with the organization to which he belongs and which is involved in the commission of international crimes; further, the applicant must have knowledge of these crimes and of these acts (Mukwaya v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2001] F.C.J. No. 972 (F.C.T.D.) and Murillo v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] 3 F.C. 287 (F.C.T.D.)). In Sungu v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] 3 F.C. 192, Blanchard J. gave an excellent overview of the caselaw on "complicity": 
 
 
 
 [31] The question of complicity was also considered by Madam Justice Reed in Penate v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 2 F.C. 79 (T.D.). Following an analysis of the decisions in Ramirez, supra, Moreno, supra, and Sivakumar v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 F.C. 433 (C.A.), Reed J. concluded, at pages 84-85: 
 
 
 
 As I understand the jurisprudence, it is that a person who is a member of the persecuting group and who has knowledge that activities are being committed by the group and who neither takes steps to prevent them occurring (if he has the power to do so) nor disengages himself from the group at the earliest opportunity (consistent with safety for himself) but who lends his active support to the group will be considered to be an accomplice. A shared common purpose will be considered to exist. I note that the situation envisaged by this jurisprudence is not one in which isolated incidents of international offences have occurred but where the commission of such offences is a continuous and regular part of the operation. 
 
 
 
 [32] Likewise, in Sivakumar, supra, the Court of Appeal, following Ramirez, supra, explained that a person may be considered "an accomplice through association" and laid down the following principles: 
 
 
 
 - Complicity through association can mean that individuals may be rendered responsible for the acts of others because of their close association with the principal actors. 
 
 
 
 - Furthermore, the case for an individual's complicity in international crimes committed by his or her organization is stronger if the individual member in question holds a position of importance within the organization. The closer one is to being a leader rather than an ordinary member, the more likely it is that an inference will be drawn that one knew of the crime and shared the organization's purpose in committing that crime. 
 
 
 
 - In such circumstances, an important factor to consider is evidence that the individual protested against the crime or tried to stop its commission or attempted to withdraw from the organization. 
 
 
 
 - Association with an organization responsible for the perpetration of international crimes may constitute complicity if there is personal and knowing participation or toleration of the crimes. 
 
 
 
 [33] Moreover, in Bazargan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996), 205 N.R. 282, the Federal Court of Appeal held that "personal and knowing participation" may be direct or indirect and does not require formal membership in the organization that is ultimately engaged in the condemned activities. It is not working within an organization that makes someone an accomplice to the organization's activities, but knowingly contributing to those activities in any way or making them possible, whether from within or from outside the organization. Those who become involved in an operation that is not theirs, but that they know will probably lead to the commission of an international offence, lay themselves open to the application of the exclusion clause in the same way as those who play a direct part in the operation.
