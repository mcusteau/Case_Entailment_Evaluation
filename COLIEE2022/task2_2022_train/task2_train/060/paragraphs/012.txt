 [12] 
  The applicant raises the following issues: 
 
 
 
 1. What is the correct standard of review with respect to the refusals of the Board to reopen refugee claims? 
 
 
 
 2. Whether refusal to open a refugee claim, where abandonment of the claim was caused solely by the error of the applicant's counsel, constitutes a breach of the principles of natural justice? 
 
 
 
 3. Whether the applicant acted with due care and intended to pursue his refugee claim at all times? 
 
 
 
 4. Whether the omission to provide the Board with the applicant's current address was solely the fault of applicant's counsel? 
 
 
 
 5. Whether the applicant should be made responsible for the errors of his counsel? 
 
 
 
 I would summarize the central issue of this claim as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. Under the circumstances of this particular case, did the Board's refusal to reopen the refugee claim constitute a breach of the principles of natural justice?
