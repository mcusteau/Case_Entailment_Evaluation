In summary, even aside from the issue of admissibility, I am satisfied that the evidence in Mr. Glowczewski's new affidavit and attached exhibits do not add anything that would have materially affected the Board's decision. In light of my finding, it is unnecessary for me to consider the additional evidence tendered by the Respondent. In any event, I am of the view that the affidavits of Ms. Lithwick and Ms. Fraser are not probative either. The Board already had before it ample evidence of the word "tradition" appearing in the trademark Register and on the labels of products sold in grocery stores. Moreover, that evidence did not form a significant basis for the Board's decision.
