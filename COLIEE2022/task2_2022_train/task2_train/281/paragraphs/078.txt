With respect to the lack of evidence of actual confusion, the Applicant submits that the Board erred in drawing an adverse inference because there was no evidence of extensive concurrent use of the parties' respective trademarks. The Applicant further argues that, in any event, the existence of actual confusion is irrelevant because the Respondent's trademark application is based on proposed use. Although I agree with the Applicant that there was little evidence of concurrent use presented to the Board, I do not take from the Board's decision that its comment regarding the lack of evidence of actual confusion was determinative of its overall finding with respect to confusion. Moreover, although the trademark at issue in this appeal is a proposed use trademark, similar trademarks owned by the Respondent have appeared on products in the market place for several years now and, as such, it was not improper for the Board to note the fact that no actual instances of confusion between those trademarks and the Applicant's trademarks had been reported.
