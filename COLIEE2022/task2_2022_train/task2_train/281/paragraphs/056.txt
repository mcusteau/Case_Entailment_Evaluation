Although the Supreme Court of Canada in
Mattel
, and the cases referenced, dealt with a decision by the Board concerning confusion between trademarks, in my view, the analysis conducted by the Supreme Court in
Mattel
in regards to the four contextual factors on application of the pragmatic and functional approach in respect to confusion applies equally to distinctiveness. In the result, the same standard of review articulated above applies to the Board's decision respecting the issue of distinctiveness.
