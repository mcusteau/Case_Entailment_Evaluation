The Applicant's third ground of opposition is that the Respondent's trademark is not distinctive. The Applicant contends that the Board erred in concluding that the Respondent's proposed trademark is distinctive. In particular, the Applicant argues that the word "tradition'l" is clearly descriptive. Moreover, the Applicant states that there is no evidence that the Respondent's trademark had become distinctive through extensive use at the time its application for registration was made. Aside from the word mark, the Applicant also submits that the design elements of the Respondent's trademark indicate that it is clearly descriptive. Specifically, the Applicant states that the image of a bagel with two sheaves of wheat, as a whole and as a matter of first impression, simply conveys traditional bagels made of wheat. Further, the remaining components of the mark which are not descriptive of the Respondent's wares - namely, the ribbon, the five stars and the font - are insignificant and are overwhelmed by the wheat and the word mark, according to the Applicant.
