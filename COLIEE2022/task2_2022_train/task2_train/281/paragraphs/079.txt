Regarding the Applicant's allegation that the Board erred by focusing on the 'L in TRADITION'L, rather than on the similar sound of the parties' respective trademarks, I note first that the proposed trademark of the Respondent is BAGEL TRADITION'L and not just TRADITION'L. In any event, the pronunciation of TRADITION'L in either English or French is different from the sounding out of the Applicant's trademark, TRADITION. As such, in my view, it was reasonably open to the Board to find that an ordinary consumer - even with imperfect recollection - hearing both trademarks would not likely be confused between them.
