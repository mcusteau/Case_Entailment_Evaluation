Moreover, in determining whether trademarks are confusing, the Board (and the Court) must examine the trademarks in their totality, as Justice Alice Desjardins stated in
Park Avenue Furniture
, above at page 426 [C.P.R.].
"I agree with the appellant that marks are to be considered in their entirety. On this very point, H.G. Fox says the following:
'In applying these tests the first principle to be invoked is that the marks are to be looked at as totalities and not as dissected items. The idea of each mark, that is, the net impression left by the mark as a whole upon the mind is to be considered. It is the mark taken in its entirety that is to be examined and a decision then arrived at whether such mark is likely to cause confusion with one already registered ... The true test is whether the totality of the mark proposed to be registered is such that it is likely to cause mistake or deception or confusion in the minds of persons accustomed to the existing trademark. It is the combination of the marks as a whole that is to be regarded and the effect or idea of the whole that is to be compared.'"
