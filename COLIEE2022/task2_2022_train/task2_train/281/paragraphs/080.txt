I reject the Applicant's fourth allegation that the Board erred in dissecting the parties' trademarks in determining the degree of resemblance between them. I am of the view that the Board did indeed focus on the totality of the trademarks as the jurisprudence requires it to do. While the Board considered the word components of the Respondent's proposed trademark and the Applicant's trademarks in conducting its analysis, it determined that the resemblance between trademarks is "rather small" and, as a result, there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion. The Board's determination, in my view, is based clearly on consideration of the totality of the trademark as required. This is acknowledged by the Board in its reasons. The Board's determination in this respect was reasonably open to it on the record.
