Regarding the application of the wrong test, the Applicant submits that the Board misapplied the reasoning in
Clorox
, above, in holding that trademarks can co-exist within the same product class of wares sold in the same area of a grocery store. The Applicant states that in
Clorox
, the Court found that registration of a trademark only limits the owner of the registration from excluding others from using the trademark on unrelated food products sold in other sections of the grocery store. In my view, it is the Applicant who has misstated the reasons of the Court in
Clorox
. In that case, Justice Joyal observed that the "narrow protection" doctrine applies equally to the "similarity of wares" factor as it does to the "inherent distinctiveness" factor under s. 6(5) of the
Act
. His point was to caution against giving too much weight to the fact that products fall within the "same general class"; otherwise, holders of weak trademarks would essentially gain a monopoly over a particular word. That is, just because two trademarks operate in the "same general class" does not automatically mean that confusion will ensue. Rather, the Board and the Court must consider more specifically how similar the wares are, especially where the opponent's trademark is found to be not inherently distinctive. In the present case, the Board found both the Applicant's and the Respondent's trademarks to be weak and the nature of their respective wares - muffins versus bagels - to be different. Therefore, in my view, the Board properly applied the Court's decision in
Clorox
in affording little weight to the fact that the Applicant's and Respondent's trademarks both exist in the "same general class" of wares.
