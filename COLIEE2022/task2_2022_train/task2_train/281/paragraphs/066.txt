As for the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony, it is clear that the Applicant wishes to introduce the transcript as evidence that the Respondent's proposed trademark is not distinctive and, therefore, not registrable. The Applicant submits that Mr. Joyet admits, in his own words, that the word "tradition'l" was chosen because the Respondent's bagels are made according to a traditional baking style and a traditional recipe. As such, the Applicant contends that the words in the Respondent's proposed trademark are "clearly descriptive" of the character or quality of the wares and services in association with which the trademark will be used.
