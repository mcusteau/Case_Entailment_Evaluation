Even if I were to consider Mr. Joyet's testimony as recorded in the transcript, I find that the evidence would not change the conclusion reached by the Board with respect to the issue of distinctiveness. In his testimony, Mr. Joyet states that he considers the Respondent's bagels to be traditional and cooked in a traditional way. However, he also states that other people would not consider the Respondent's bagels to be traditional or cooked in a traditional way. As such, I would find that Mr. Joyet's evidence does not establish that "tradition'l" is clearly descriptive of the "material composition" or the "intrinsic quality" of a bagel.
