Whether or not trademarks are confusing depends on the first impression of an "ordinary hurried purchaser": see

, at paragraph 5b. In
Miss Universe Inc. v. Bohna
, [1995] 1 F.C. 614; 176 N.R. 35 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 9, Justice Robert DÃ©cary stated the following:
"To decide whether the use of a trade mark or of a trade name causes confusion with another trade mark or another trade name, the court must ask itself whether, as a matter of first impression on the minds of an ordinary person having a vague recollection of that other mark or name, the use of both marks or names in the same area in the same manner is likely to lead to the inference that the service associated with those marks or names are performed by the same person, whether or not the services are of the same general class."
