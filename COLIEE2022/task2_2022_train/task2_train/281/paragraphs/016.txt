With respect to the burden of proof, the initial onus is on the party opposing registration to establish that it had used its trademark prior to the material date. Once the opponent has done so, the onus then shifts to the person applying to register the trademark to show on a balance of probabilities that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion: see
Sunshine Biscuits Inc. v. Corporate Foods Ltd.
(1982), 61 C.P.R.(2d) 53 (F.C.T.D.). If there is any doubt as to whether the party applying to register a trademark has satisfied the requirement of "no reasonable likelihood of confusion", then the Board must refuse the application: see
Conde Nast Publications Inc. v. Union des Ã‰ditions Modernes
(1979), 46 C.P.R.(2d) 183 (F.C.T.D.), at page 188.
