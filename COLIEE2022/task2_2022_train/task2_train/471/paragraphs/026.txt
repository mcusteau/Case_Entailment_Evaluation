Furthermore, I dismiss the applicant's claim according to which he did not specifically mention Falun Gong to the Immigration officers, because they did not allude or refer to it. It is clear from the Board's hearing transcripts that the applicant understood the officer had asked him whether he was associated with any groups. He did not mention Falun Gong. It was therefore reasonable of the Board to come to a negative finding with respect to the applicant's testimony on a crucial point of his refugee claim.
Q. Now, as I read your Personal Information Form and hear your testimony today it seems to be that your problems that you have back in China have to do with some relationship you have with the Falun Gong movement. Not that you were a member of this group, but you practised one of the exercises, and that you were an information gatherer and you imparted information even from Canada bout what was going on with people involved in Falun Gong. Is that correct?
A. Yes.
Q. Now, when you were interviewed by Immigration Canada, you were asked information about your association with groups, societies or organizations. You make reference here it seems to kung fu and to karate, but no specific reference to Falun Gong. Is there a reason?
A. Because at the time immigration officer didn't ask my why.
