None of these legislative provisions bestow any authority on the respondent to stay the charges against the applicant. The decision as to whether an inmate should be charged with a disciplinary offence and whether circumstances warrant dropping or dismissing those charges is clearly within the ambit of jurisdiction of the head of the institution. The independent chairperson of the disciplinary court, in this case the respondent, is clearly charged with only three functions pursuant to the legislation: 1) to preside over a disciplinary court [Regulation 38.1(1)]; 2) to determine the innocence or guilt of an inmate based on the evidence presented at the hearing [Regulation 38(5)(a)]; and, 3) to impose an appropriate punishment for the offence [Regulation 38(5)(b)].
