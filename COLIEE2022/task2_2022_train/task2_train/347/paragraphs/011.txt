According to these provisions it is the institutional head of each institution which is responsible for the discipline of inmates. Pursuant to s. 38(5) the duty of the Disciplinary Court is to determine the innocence or guilt of an inmate and then to impose the punishment prescribed by the Regulations which the court deems appropriate in the circumstances. Those are the only powers conferred upon the Disciplinary Court by the Regulations aside from s. 38(13) which allows the court to order that a punishment imposed not be carried out on certain conditions.
