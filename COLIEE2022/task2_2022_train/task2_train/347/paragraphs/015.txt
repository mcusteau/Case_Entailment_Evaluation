The applicant further argued that the respondent had the discretion to dismiss the charges on the basis that it was within the power of the respondent, in the absence of statutory provisions to the contrary, to establish its own procedure. Counsel relied on the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Howard v. Stony Mountain Institution, [1984] 2 F.C. 642; 57 N.R. 280. The principle that a tribunal, such as the Disciplinary Court, is the master of its own procedure is a well-established principle of law. However, the question of whether charges should be stayed or dismissed is not a procedural issue but a substantive one to be determined by those individuals responsible for the laying of the charge in the first place.
