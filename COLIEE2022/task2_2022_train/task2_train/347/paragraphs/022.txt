The distinction between the two paragraphs is that pursuant to (g), an inmate, in order to have committed an offence, must have behaved towards another person in a threatening manner. The phrase "behaves towards another person", in my view, contemplates that the party who is the subject of the threat is in the presence of the inmate who is issuing the threat; that is, in order for an inmate to behave toward any other person by his language in a threatening manner the other person must be the direct recipient of and be witness to such behavior. If paragraph 39(g) were afforded an alternative interpretation so as to include as an offence any threat uttered by an inmate at any time, it would be redundant with the offence set out in paragraph (b) and would virtually render the word "behaves" as it appears in paragraph (g) void of any meaning. Such an interpretation would be contrary with the general principle of statutory interpretation that the construction that gives effect to the whole of the provision under consideration should be adopted in preference to one that renders part thereof meaningless. In Hill v. William Hill (Park Lane Ltd.), [1949] A.C. 530, Viscount Simon stated at pp. 546-547:
"[...] though a Parliamentary enactment (like parliamentary eloquence) is capable of saying the same thing twice over without adding anything to what has been said once, this repetition in the case of an
Act
of Parliament is not to be assumed.
When the legislature enacts a particular phrase in a statute the presumption is that it is saying something which has not been said immediately before
