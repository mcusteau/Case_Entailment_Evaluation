[14]
The sister does not say whether what she reported to the police was the assault on her or an account of the entire history of the matter. Nor does she substantiate her affidavit evidence by a medical report of her injuries or a copy of the police report. Since the sister only says she reported "the matter" to the police, I cannot say that the RPD's rationale for giving her affidavit little weight falls outside the realm of reasonable outcomes. The onus is on the Applicant to prove his claim and the affidavits of his sister and mother he provided are mere generalized declarations lacking in detail or corroboration.
