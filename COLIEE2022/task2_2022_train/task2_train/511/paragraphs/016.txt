The RPD does not dispute the Applicant is bisexual and engaged in homosexual activity. Nor does the RPD dispute the Applicant was seriously injured and hospitalized for engaging in that activity in 2002. The RPD came to a negative s.96 conclusion stating;
Although he stopped for some time, he re-entered a homosexual relationship and conducted his affairs discretely for several years. It is reasonable to conclude the claimant could return to St. Lucia and live as he was living without a serious possibility of being persecuted by society.
