In
Odetoyinbo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2009 FC 501, Justice Martineau stated that an adverse credibility finding, conclusive of a refugee claim under s. 96 of IRPA, is not necessarily conclusive of a refugee claim under s. 97 since the evidence necessary to establish a claim differs from s. 96. There are subjective and objective components to s. 96 which is not the case in s. 97.
