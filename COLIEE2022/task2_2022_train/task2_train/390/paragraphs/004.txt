With respect to the application for an order under rule 407(2) to require the plaintiff to produce a document entitled "Space Pets" referred to in his statement of claim, the affidavit of William Dutton shows that a demand for this document was made by letter of November 19, 1985. The plaintiff's solicitor responded by providing a copy of the script "Space Pets" which bears the names of both the plaintiff and David Hurry. This is clearly the document alleged to have been sent to the defendants. Further, by his response to the demand under rule 407 the plaintiff's solicitor must be taken to have confirmed that this is the document in respect of which breach of copyright is alleged in the statement of claim. Counsel for the plaintiff has elsewhere indicated, according to the Dutton affidavit, that the plaintiff cannot produce the original notes referred to above. There is a very strong principle in favour of requiring production of the document in which a plaintiff claims copyright. As was said by Mahoney, J., in United States Surgical Corporation v. Downs Surgical Canada Limited. [See footnote 3]:
"Quite apart from, and more basic than, the requirement of rule 407(2) is the question whether a party can be permitted to assert his copyright in an entire work and the infringement of that right, while refusing to divulge the entire work. The answer is obviously that he cannot. He must disclose everything in which he claims copyright or his action will be terminated summarily. There would be no point in going to trial."
But the plaintiff has taken the position that the document he has produced is the one of which he claims to be the author and in which he claims copyright. He must stand or fall on that proposition. There is no point in me making any order for further production in respect of this work.
