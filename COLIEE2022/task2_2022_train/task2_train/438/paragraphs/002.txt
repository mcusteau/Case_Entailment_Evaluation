The key findings and conclusions of the Board were as follows:
- the Applicant was not a Convention refugee because his claim had no nexus to the Convention refugee definition;
- the Applicant had a well-founded fear of persecution if he were to return to the Sukholimanskaya/Odessa area based on the harassment at the hands of Sergey Shevchuk ("Shevchuk"), which, cumulatively, amounted to persecution;
- the Applicant's Jewish background was an incidental element in the harassment by Shevchuk, with the crucial issue being his relationship with Natasha, a non Jewish girl, which led to a serious personal antipathy and vendetta;
- the claimant had a viable internal flight alternative ("IFA") in Kiev;
- it was objectively reasonable for him to seek refuge in Kiev;
- he would not be at risk of harm at the hands of the Ukranian mafia in Kiev;
- there was not a reasonable chance that the Applicant would suffer persecution by the reason of his Jewish background in Kiev.
