As with the other components of the Convention refugee definition, the claimant bears the onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a serious possibility of persecution throughout the country, including the area which is alleged to afford an IFA. Thus, the Board's IFA conclusion is simply part of its conclusion that there is not a serious possibility that the Applicant will be persecuted. I can see no reason why the less deferential standard of correctness should apply to one part of this determination (e.g. IFA) and not to another (e.g. adequate state protection or whether discrimination amounts to persecution).
