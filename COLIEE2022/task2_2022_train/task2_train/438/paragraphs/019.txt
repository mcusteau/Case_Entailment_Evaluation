The Applicant takes issue with this reference. I do not view the Board's statement regarding limited resources as an acknowledgement that state protection is as unavailable in Kiev as in the Applicant's village. Rather, it is simply a statement giving a reason for the weakness (not failure) of the existing state protection. In this particular section of the Board's decision, the Board appears to be addressing both the weaknesses of the state protection and whether its weaknesses can be seen as related to race or ethnicity. While the drafting may be less than perfectly clear, there is no reviewable error.
