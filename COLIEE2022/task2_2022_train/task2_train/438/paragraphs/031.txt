The most recent documentary evidence before the Board indicated that the central government in Ukraine has taken real steps to protect its Jewish citizens from violence; that the threat to Jews remains in some local or regional areas where anti-Semitic Soviet era officials still hold sway; and that rampant anti-Semitism is not a problem in Ukraine. One example of the documentary evidence was the Research Directorate's Issue Paper
Ukraine: Situation of Jews
, dated January 1999, which suggests that it might be easier for Ukrainian citizens to get legal redress in Kiev than in provincial towns and cities. Other documentary evidence referred to the fact that the Ukrainian government is committed to fighting anti-Semitism and that the Jewish population has enjoyed increasing opportunities for religious and cultural expression since Ukrainian independence. Thus, although the analysis of the evidence could have been more thorough in the decision and while I might have decided otherwise, the Board's conclusion was not, in my view, perverse.
