  The Board reviewed the law governing the presumption of state protection. It stated that local failures to provide effective policing do not amount to inadequate protection. Relying upon the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Kadenko v. Canada (Solicitor General) (1996), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 532, the Board stated that "the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her". The Board held that the applicants failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection with "clear and convincing" evidence.
