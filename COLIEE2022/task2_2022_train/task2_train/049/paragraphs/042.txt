  The Federal Court of Appeal recently clarified the presumption of state protection in  
 Carillo v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2008 FCA 94, 69 Imm. L.R. (3d) 309, per Justice Létourneau. The Court engaged in a detailed discussion at paras. 16-30 on the distinctions between "burden of proof, standard of proof and quality of evidence". The Court held that the "heavy burden" to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection in democratic societies, as referred to in  
 Hinzman v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2007 FCA 171, per Justice Sexton, at paragraph 57, was simply an acknowledgement of the difficulty of furnishing sufficient evidence in such circumstances: 
 
 
 
 ¶26 I think our colleague, as was La Forest J. in the  
 Ward 
  case, referred to the quality of the evidence that needs to be adduced to convince the trier of fact of the inadequate state protection. In other words, it is more difficult in some cases than others to rebut the presumption. But this in no way alters the standard of proof. In this respect, I fully agree with the finding of the judge that La Forest J. in  
 Ward 
  was referring to the quality of the evidence necessary to rebut the presumption and not to a higher standard of proof.
