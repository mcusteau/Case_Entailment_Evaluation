  The first issue touches upon issues of fact, and mixed law and fact. In  
 Acosta v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2009 FC 213, [2009] F.C.J. No. 270 (QL), Justice Gauthier held at para. 11 that interpreting the exclusion of generalized risks of violence under subsection 97(1)(b) of IRPA was an issue of application of law to the particular facts of a case and therefore reviewable on a standard of reasonableness following the Federal Court of Appeal decision in  
 Proph√®te v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2009 FCA 31, para. 7. The first issue is therefore reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
