In the present case, it appears that the Registrar based his finding that the appellant was not using the trademark "MacGregor" pursuant to sections 4(1) and 4(3) of the Act on the insufficiency of the evidence adduced before him. The relevant part of his decision reads as follows:
"On the other hand, counsel for the registrant argues that since two of the sales, evidenced by the invoices filed as Exhibit A, were effected F.O.B. Arnold's Cove, Newfoundland, then those two sales were effected in Canada and the reference 'MACG KIPPER SMOKED' marked on the invoices meet the association requirements of s. 4(1).
"I cannot subscribe to the registrant's contentions. The question is not who owns the wares and at what time within the normal course of trade. The question to be determined is whether the trademark is in use. The Act is very clear that in export trade when the wares or their packaging are marked in Canada and subsequently exported then the trademark is deemed in use.
"In the instant case we know that smoked kippered herring is being exported to the United States, by the registrant, but we do not know if it is trademarked in Canada before shipment. Paragraph 3 of the Whitman affidavit comes close to resolving the problem, but in my respectful opinion, is vague and does not establish any facts. It must therefore be considered as a bare allegation of fact of the type ruled as insufficient Aerosol Fillers Inc. v. Plough (Canada) Ltd. (1980), 45 C.P.R.(2d) 164; affirmed (1981), 53 C.P.R.(2d) 62.
"Therefore, by reason of the evidence filed in these proceedings, I must conclude that use of the mark has not been shown within the meaning of the Act and that consequently its registration ought to be expunged from the register."
