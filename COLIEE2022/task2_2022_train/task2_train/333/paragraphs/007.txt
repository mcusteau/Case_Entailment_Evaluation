The relevant provisions of the Trade Marks Act state as follows:
"2. In this Act
'trademark' means
(a) a mark that is used by a person for the purpose of distinguishing or so as to distinguish wares or services manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by him or performed by others,
(b) a certification mark,
(c) a distinguishing guise, or
(d) a proposed trademark;
'use' in relation to a trademark, means any use that by section 4 is deemed to be a use in association with wares or services;
"4(1) a trademark is deemed to be used in association with wares if, at the time of the transfer of the property in or possession of such wares, in the normal course of trade, it is marked on the wares themselves or on the packages in which they are distributed or it is in any other manner so associated with the wares that notice of the association is then given to the person to whom the property or possession is transferred.
"4(3) A trademark that is marked in Canada on wares or on the packages in which they are contained is, when such wares are exported from Canada, deemed to be used in Canada in association with such wares.
"44(1) The Registrar may at any time and, at the written request made after three years from the date of the registration by any person who pays the prescribed fee shall, unless he sees good reason to the contrary, give notice to the registered owner requiring him to furnish within three months an affidavit or statutory declaration showing with respect to each of the wares or services specified in the registration, whether the trademark is in use in Canada and, if not, the date when it was last so in use and the reason for the absence of such use since such date.
"44(2) The Registrar shall not receive any evidence other than such affidavit or statutory declaration, but may hear representations made by or on behalf of the registered owner of the trademark or by or on behalf of the person at whose request the notice was given.
"44(3) Where, by reason of the evidence furnished to him or the failure to furnish such evidence, it appears to the Registrar that the trademark, either with respect to all of the wares or services specified in the registration or with respect to any of such wares or services, is not in use in Canada and that the absence of use has not been due to special circumstances that excuse such absence of use, the registration of such trademark is liable to be expunged or amended accordingly.
"44(4) When the Registrar reaches a decision as to whether or not the registration of the trademark ought to be expunged or amended, he shall give notice of his decision with the reasons therefor to the registered owner of the trademark and to the person at whose request the notice was given.
"44(5) The Registrar shall act in accordance with his decision if no appeal therefrom is taken within the time limited by this Act or, if an appeal is taken, shall act in accordance with the final judgment given in such appeal."
