  As acknowledged by the Applicants' counsel, these are the same questions that were proposed to Justice Zinn in  
 Gabor 
 , above. In  
 Gabor v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 1231, Justice Zinn declined to certify either of these questions. For the same reasons provided by Justice Zinn, I also decline to certify these questions.
