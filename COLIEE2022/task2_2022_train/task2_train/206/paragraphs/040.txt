  I might agree with the Applicants if the evidence had demonstrated that police always refuse to attend crime scenes. However, that is not the situation here. Reading the balance of the paragraph in which the impugned statement is contained provides context for the remark. In the specific situation, where the Applicants were unable to provide any details of the alleged crime, the Board concluded that this one-time failure to attend a crime scene did not bring the overall ability or willingness of the state to provide protection into question. There is no error.
