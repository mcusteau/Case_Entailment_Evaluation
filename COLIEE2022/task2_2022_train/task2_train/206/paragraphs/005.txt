  The first issue is a pure question of law; the Board's conclusion will be reviewed on a standard of correctness. The second issue - the application of the correct test to the issue of state protection - can also be considered to be a question of law reviewable on the standard of correctness. However, the final issues involve the overall conclusion of the Board as to the credibility of the Applicants and the existence of adequate state protection. The Board's reasons and conclusions, on this issue, will be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. On this standard, the Court should not intervene where the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (

 , 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 at para. 47).
