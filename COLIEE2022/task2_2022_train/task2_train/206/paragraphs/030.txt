  The Applicants claim the Board ought to have considered the demeanour of the Female Applicant when she testified and taken into account the shame suffered by her when the sterilization took place without her consent. According to the Female Applicant's affidavit, when she described the alleged events before the Board, she was "trembling and crying". The shame felt by the Female Applicant and her demeanour do not alter the fact that either she or the Principal Applicant could have tried to obtain documents from the hospital or the psychiatrist to support this critical element of their claim. I also note that the Applicants were given an opportunity to provide further documentation after the hearing and failed to do so; this failure certainly cannot be explained by the demeanour of the Female Applicant.
