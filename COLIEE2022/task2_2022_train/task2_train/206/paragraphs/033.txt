  I see no principled reasons why the disclosure of a critical element two days before a hearing should prevent the Board from drawing a negative inference from the absence of such element in the original PIF. The point made by Justice Teitelbaum is not changed; claimants should include all important facts in the PIF and the Board is entitled to draw a negative inference from a failure to do so.
