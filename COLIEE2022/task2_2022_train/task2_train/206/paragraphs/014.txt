  In light of the existing jurisprudence on this very issue, I am of the view that this case is one where the principle of judicial comity is directly applicable. As stated by Justice Lemieux in  
 Almrei v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 1025, 316 F.T.R. 49 at paragraphs 61-62: 
 
 
 
 The principle of judicial comity is well-recognized by the judiciary in Canada. Applied to decisions rendered by judges of the Federal Court, the principle is to the effect that a substantially similar decision rendered by a judge of this Court should be followed in the interest of advancing certainty in the law. . . . [citations omitted.] 
 
 
 
 There are a number of exceptions to the principle of judicial comity as expressed above they are: 
 
 
 
 1. The existence of a different factual matrix or evidentiary basis between the two cases; 
 
 
 
 2. Where the issue to be decided is different; 
 
 
 
 3. Where the previous condition failed to consider legislation or binding authorities that would have produced a different result, i.e., was manifestly wrong; and 
 
 
 
 4. The decision it followed would create an injustice.
