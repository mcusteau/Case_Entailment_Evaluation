The applicant claims that his application was prejudiced as a result of the visa officer's failure to award him any points in the occupational factor category. He points to the fact that in the occupations of electric engineer (CCDO 2144-122), electronic engineering technologist (CCDO 2165-130) and electronic engineering technician (CCDO 2165-230) [the category he was deemed by the officer to satisfy], all have award factors of at least one point. Furthermore, the applicant points to the disparity between the visa officers notes concerning his financial resources, indicated as $8,000 USD, compared to the value placed on the assessment form, $7,000 CDN.
