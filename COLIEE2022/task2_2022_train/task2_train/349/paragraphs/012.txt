Recently, a review of the duties of visa officers appraising immigrant applications for permanent residence in Canada was undertaken by my colleague Muldoon, J., in the case of
Saggu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1994), 87 F.T.R. 137. Some of the following propositions were observed:
"a) Indeed, as demonstrated by
Yang v. Canada
(M.E.I.) T-1595-91 (17 July 1992) (F.C.T.D.), a visa officer has a duty to consider fully the submissions and information provided by an applicant. A failure to do so will result in doubt as to whether a proper assessment of the applicant has taken place, and an order of certiorari will accordingly be available. As a matter of fairness, the record should show that the applicant was given the opportunity to provide information in support of his current experience in each included occupation:
Hajariwala v. Canada (M.E.I.)
, [1989] 2 F.C. 79 (F.C.T.D.); (1988) 6 Imm. L.R.(2d) 222; 34 Admin. L.R. 206; 23 F.T.R. 241.
"b) The visa officer has a duty to assess an application with reference to the occupation represented by the applicant as the one for which he or she is qualified and prepared to pursue in Canada. That duty extends to each such occupation. An order of certiorari and mandamus will be available where there has been a failure to do so. See:
Gaffney v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1991), 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 185; 121 N.R. 256; 40 F.T.R. 79 (note) (F.C.A). Further, there is a clear responsibility on the part of a visa officer to assess alternate occupations inherent in the applicant's work experience:
Li v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1990), 9 Imm. L.R.(2d) 263 (F.C.T.D.). A visa officer must consider an applicant's aptitudes, previous work experience, and whether or not this constitutes experience in the intended occupations. To that end, the visa officer's decision should be somewhat "forward-looking":
Dhaliwal v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1992), 16 Imm. L.R.(2d) 212 (F.C.T.D.) and
Hung v. Canada (Solicitor General)
, IMM-3968-93 (F.C.T.D.) (Sept. 23, 1994).
"c) The onus is on the applicant to establish that he/she meets the selection criteria established by the
Regulations
, and that admission to Canada would not be contrary to the
Act
and
Regulations
. See:
Yu v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1990), 11 Imm. L.R.(2d) 176; 36 F.T.R. 296 (F.C.T.D.)
D'Souza v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1990), 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 268; 39 F.T.R. 1 (F.C.T.D.) and
Hajariwala v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1988), 6 Imm. L.R.(2d) 222; 34 Admin. L.R. 206; 23 F.T.R. 241; [1989] 2 F.C. 79 (F.C.T.D.).
"d) Where the visa officer has an impression of deficiency in the proof being offered by an applicant, there may be a duty to give the applicant some opportunity to disabuse the visa officer of that crucial impression. The duty of fairness owed to the applicant may require that such an opportunity be given:
Fong v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1990), 11 Imm. L.R.(2d) 205; 35 F.T.R. 305; [1990] 3 F.C. 705 (F.C.T.D.) and
Dhaliwal v. Canada (M.E.I.)
(1992), 16 Imm. L.R.(2d) 212 (F.C.T.D.). [See also:
Sui v. Canada (M.E.I.)
, Imm-6250-93 (F.C.T.D) (December 6, 1994)]
"e) A visa officer must not improperly fetter his/her discretion:
Canada (M.E.I.) v. Ho
, A-187-89 (F.C.A) (May 22, 1990), and
Uy v. Canada (M.E.I.)
, [1991] 2 F.C. 201 (F.C.A).
"f) A visa officer should exercise the
Regulations
s. 11(3) discretion nevertheless to grant landing only if it appears that the total units awarded do not reflect the particular applicant's chances of successful establishment. If there is no information before the visa officer upon which he may draw that conclusion, the opportunity to exercise this particular discretion does not arise:
Man v. Canada (M.E.I.)
, T-2351-91 (January 19, 1993), and
Zeng v. Canada (M.E.I.)
, A-131-89 (January 8, 1991) (F.C.A)."
