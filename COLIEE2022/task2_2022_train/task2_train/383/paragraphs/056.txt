Finally, there was some discussion as to the proper standard to be used in assessing the risk under section 97(1)(b). This was indeed a question that was certified for an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal under section 74(d) of the Act. Fortunately, we now have the benefit of the Court of Appeal's views, as they decided in Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 1, that the degree of risk under paragraphs 97(1)(a) and (b), is "more likely than not". Rothstein J.A., speaking for the Court of Appeal, also noted that the standard of proof to be applied, under both section 96 and section 97 of the IRPA, is the balance of probabilities test. The Board did not err in applying the balance of probabilities test, but, as it erred in the credibility finding, the decision must be set aside.

In conclusion, I am of the view that the Board did not properly assess Mrs. Anthonimuthu's credibility and the plausibility of her claim, and that these findings are sufficiently central to the Board's analysis to require that the decision be set aside. No question will be certified.
