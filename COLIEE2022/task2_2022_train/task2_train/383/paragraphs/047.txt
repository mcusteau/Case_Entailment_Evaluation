The least that could have been expected from the Board was to give its reasons for casting doubt upon the applicant's credibility (Hilo v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 130 N.R. 236 (F.C.A.); Mui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. no. 1294 (F.C. T.D.). In the present case, the Board concluded that the claimant came to Canada in order to be with her children, and rejected rather summarily her allegation of being a victim of extortion. The summary rejection was based on the implausibility of such an "exorbitant" amount of money, and an absence of evidence that elderly Tamils were being extorted in Colombo.
