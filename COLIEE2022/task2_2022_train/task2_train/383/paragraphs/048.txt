Bearing in mind the words of caution of Muldoon J. in Valtchev, supra, and considering that terrorist organizations do not always act rationally, I do not find that twelve lakhs (1,200,000 rupees or approximately CDN$16,000) is an implausible amount of extortion. Indeed, the evidence reveals that the LTTE demanded up to 1,000,000 rupees for the release of kidnapped businessmen in 2001; (Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, U.S. Department of State, 2002, at page 6; Application Record, page 47). Since the LTTE knew that the Applicant had four children living in Canada, it is far from obvious that the claimant could not have been threatened with detention unless she paid 1,200,000 rupees.
