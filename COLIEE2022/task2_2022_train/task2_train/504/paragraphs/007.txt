I think I should set out my approach to motions for extensions of time. I start with the premise that the time limits set out in the
Rules
are meant to be complied with. If they are too short then requests should be made to have the
Rules
amended so that the time limits are lengthened. I do not grant requests for extensions of time merely because it is the first time that counsel has asked or because the work load which counsel has assumed is too great. I think such decisions are unfair to those counsel who refuse clients because their work load is too heavy to allow them to meet required deadlines or who "pull out all the stops" to meet the deadlines, at great inconvenience to themselves. As I have indicated I take the view that the time limits set out in the
Rules
are meant to be complied with and they are meant to apply to everyone equally. If an automatic extension was meant to be available merely because counsel seeks one, then, the
Rules
should provide for such an automatic extension, for everyone, when such is sought.
