Reed, J.
: On September 1, 1993, an application was placed before me seeking an extension of time for the filing of the applicant's application record. The application for an extension of time was brought under Federal Court Rule 324 which authorizes the making of decisions on the basis of the written representations filed and without an oral hearing.
