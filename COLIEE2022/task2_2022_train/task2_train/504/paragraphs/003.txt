The application for an extension of time which was received by me on September 1, 1993 had been filed in the court on August 20, 1993. The reason given for seeking an extension of time was because counsel for the applicant was going out of town from August 21 to August 27 and was unable to complete the application record before her departure. She also noted that her client lived in Campbell River and she therefore was not able to see him before leaving town on August 21. She stated that her client had a fairly arguable case. With respect to this last there was really no evidence filed to support that claim. A copy of material which had been sent by counsel to the Immigration Centre, seeking a reconsideration of its earlier decision, was filed but this material was all generated after the decision which was the subject of the leave/judicial review application.
