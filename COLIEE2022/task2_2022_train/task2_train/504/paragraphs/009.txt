There was no such unanticipated cause for the delay in the present case. At the time the leave application was filed, it was known that the time limit for the filing of the application was 30 days, counsel knew her client lived in Campbell River and that she would be attending the Bar Convention towards the end of August. The scheduling was under her personal control. Thus, it was hard for me to justify, in such circumstances, the granting of an extension of time.
