Canada Post also refers to a 19 September 1997 letter that it received from the Privacy Commissioner as follows:
"The Privacy Commissioner is satisfied that Canada Post has now provided the complainant with a clearer and more specific response to his request and he is also satisfied that the complainant received all the information in the Customer/Claims Service bank that relates to him. He has therefore concluded that the complainant has not been denied a right of access to personal information in this instance and that these complaints are not well founded."
This response from the Privacy Commissioner to Canada Post is part of what is set out in the affidavit of Richard Sharp, Canada Post's Corporate Privacy Coordinator. There was no cross-examination on the affidavit. Nor, as we shall see, any on point response from Mr. Wheaton.
