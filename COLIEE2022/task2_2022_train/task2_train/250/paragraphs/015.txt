Mr. Wheaton's response, filed 26 June 2000, sets out, among other things, that the Federal Court of Canada has the jurisdiction to hear an application for a writ of mandamus and to support that contention refers to taped telephone conversation of 30 May 2000 with Mr. Bedley of the Privacy Commissioner's office. Mr. Bedley confirmed that the Federal Court had jurisdiction to hear Mr. Wheaton's application and to give relief by way of a writ of mandamus. Mr. Wheaton also refers to a 25 September 1995 telephone conversation with an Anne Felie [sic?] of Canada Post, a long and involved conversation involving the non-delivery of a priority post letter and conjecture as to the role played in the whole affair by the RCMP. The first of these telephone conversations, the view of someone at the Privacy Commissioner's office in Ottawa, as to the Court's jurisdiction, while well-meaning, is completely irrelevant. The second, the transcript of the conversation with Anne Felie, has no bearing whatsoever on the issue of jurisdiction.
