The motion, returnable 12 June 2000, was served upon Mr. Wheaton on the 23rd of May. The hearing of the motion itself took place as part of a case management conference at 8:30 a.m. on the 12 of June. At that time counsel for Canada Post presented written material and documents together with oral argument. Mr. Wheaton, who acts for himself, spoke about his dealings with the RCMP and about being held by them, at gun point, in Prince Rupert, however his argument was not responsive to the Canada Post motion. After further discussion I allowed Mr. Wheaton 14 days within which to serve and file written representations, with a similar time within which Canada Post might respond. At that time I also set a schedule for cross-examination on affidavits and a future case management conference, in the event that the Canada Post's motion to strike out failed.
