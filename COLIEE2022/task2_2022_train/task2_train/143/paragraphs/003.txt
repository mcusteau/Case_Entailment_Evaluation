  The Applicant relied principally on her close relationship with her family to support her H&C application. She has been an orphan since her mother died in May 1990. She has one brother and two sisters residing in Canada as permanent residents. Her brother has been in Canada since October 1994, and her sisters have been in Canada since August 1991 and December 1993, respectively. Three other sisters and three other brothers reside in St. Vincent. Her brother and his spouse in Canada have been like her parents. The family she has in Canada continues to support her and wants to help her financially to continue her studies in Canada. She lives with one of her sisters, Judita (whom she also claims she helps financially by sharing living expenses and rent). The Applicant insisted also on the fact that she has become established and integrated into Canadian society and has been employed as a babysitter and a domestic worker. In her supporting documents, she also submitted letters of support from members of her Church congregation attesting to her participation in that community.
