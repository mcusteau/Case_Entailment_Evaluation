As I understood counsel's argument, it is that Mr. Justice MacKay's decision should be reconsidered insofar as it refused a stay of the applicant's deportation order. The argument before me was not based on any inconsistency between Mr. Justice MacKay's reasons and the order he gave. The argument was merely that the Court had jurisdiction to order such a stay; see
Toth v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1989] 1 F.C. 535; 86 N.R. 302 (F.C.A.) and
Yhap v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, (89-T-676; October 12, 1989). [See [1990] 1 F.C. 722; 34 F.T.R. 26]. It is argued that Mr. Justice MacKay should have stayed the deportation order.
