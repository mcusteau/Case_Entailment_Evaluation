[11]
As I indicated to counsel, on the hearing of this application, my jurisdiction under rule 337(5) extends only to deciding whether an extension of the 10 day time limit should be given. Any decision on the merits of a rule 337(5) application can only be made by the judge who rendered the decision which it is sought to have reconsidered. I have already indicated that the claimant has not proven good cause for the delay so as to justify an extension of time for filing a s. 18 application. Those reasons equally apply to the request for an extension of the 10 day time limit set out in rule 337(5).
