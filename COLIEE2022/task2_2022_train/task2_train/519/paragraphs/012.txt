I have considered whether the judge who initially rendered the decision, of which reconsideration is sought, must also be the judge who decides on an extension of time. Rule 337(5) does not expressly so provide. In my view, it is only a reconsideration of the decision which must be determined by the Court
as constituted at the time of the pronouncement
; there is no requirement, under the rule, that a determination as to whether or not an extension of time should be granted must be decided by the Court "as constituted at the time of the pronouncement". In most instances, it is probably both practical and usual for the same judge to make both decisions. In this case, however, since the 337(5) motion is interconnected to the rule 5(2) motion, the most efficient procedure was for me to deal with both requests.
