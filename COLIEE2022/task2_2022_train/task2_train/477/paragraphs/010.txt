On the basis of this reasoning, the scoring manual ought to be disclosed to Kazmar's representative. The difficulty from Kaczmar's point of view is the decision of Richard, J. (as he then was), in
Hasan v. Canada (Attorney General)
(1996), 111 F.T.R. 214 in which the learned judge held that a scoring manual did not contain "infor­mation that pertains to the appellant or to the successful candidate ..." and therefore was not subject to disclosure. The basis of the decision was that the manual did not contain information specific to a candidate. This ruling was made in the course of a case where the primary issue was whether the Appeal Board could distinguish, for purposes of disclosure, between the appellant and his/her representative. Richard, J., concluded that there was no basis for such a distinction so that if the scoring manual was subject to disclosure, it would have to be given to the appellant himself. This does not change the nature of the manual, but it does change the consequences of disclosure. I believe that the result in
Hasan
was dictated by the circum­stances of the case.
