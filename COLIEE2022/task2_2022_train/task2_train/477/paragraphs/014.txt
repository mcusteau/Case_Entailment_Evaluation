The expression "liable to be disclosed before the appeal board" is a curious turn of phrase. One does not ordinarily speak of documents being disclosed before a tribunal. Disclosure is a practice which occurs at the pre-hearing stage when the parties exchange relevant documents for the purpose of nar­rowing the issues in the litigation. In my view, the expression must be read in the context of a provision which is attempting to define which documents are to be made available to an appellant. The first require­ment is that the documents must contain information which pertains to the candidates. This does not necessarily mean relevant information since the information must simply "pertain" to the appellant or to the successful candidate. The second require­ment, that the document is liable to be dis­closed before the appeal board, should there­fore be read so as to import the requirement of relevance, since it is relevance which determines whether a document will be accepted as evidence before a tribunal. In my view, the phrase "liable to be disclosed before the appeal board" should be read as meaning "by reason of its relevance, capable of being introduced as evidence before the appeal board."
