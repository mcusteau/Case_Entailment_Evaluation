The
Act
contemplates that eligibility lists will be prepared from which appoint足ments will be made to positions [see foot足note 1]. The fact of being placed on the eligibility list does not mean one will be appointed but one cannot be appointed if one's name does not appear on the list. In that context, at what point does a person whose name appears on the eligibility list become a successful candidate? Successful candidate is defined in s. 20 of the
Regula足tions
as a person whose name appears on the eligibility list and "who has been or is about to be appointed". But as this matter demon足strates, who is about to be appointed is a function of when the question is asked. Should this be left to the vagaries of who is still eligible for appointment at the time an appeal is launched? Is some other rationale more persuasive?
