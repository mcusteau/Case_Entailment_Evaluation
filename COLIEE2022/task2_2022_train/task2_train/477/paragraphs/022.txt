The last issue to be dealt with is the question of the exclusion of certain names from the list of persons whose test materials will be disclosed to Kaczmar. Section 24(1) of the
Regulations
defines the subject of disclosure by reference to information which pertains "to the appellant or to
the
successful candidate". Kazmar's request amounts to a request for disclosure of material which pertains to all persons whose names were placed on the eligibility list from which appointments were to be made. Is each of those persons
the
successful candidate? Once they come off the eligibility list, because of appointment in another competition or for any other reason, do they cease to be a successful candidate. Or, put another way, at what point in time is the determination of the identity of the successful candidate to be made?
