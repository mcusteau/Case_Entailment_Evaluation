In the absence of authority compelling me to do so, there is no obvious reason to depart from the plain meaning of the words used in the
Regulations
. This requires me to respect the distinction drawn between pro­viding access to the documents and provid­ing copies of the documents. If objection to disclosure is taken pursuant to s. 24(3) or (4) of the
Regulations
, the Appeal Board's authority under the
Regulations
is limited to ordering access to those documents. The Appeal Board does not have authority to order that copies be provided. To that extent the Appeal Board erred in allowing unre­stricted personal notes and photocopies to be taken of the documents to which access was granted.
