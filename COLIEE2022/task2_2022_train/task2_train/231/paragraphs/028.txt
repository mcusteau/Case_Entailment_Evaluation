Although the foregoing reasons are sufficient to dispose of this application, I will comment briefly on two other arguments of the applicants. One is that the applicants had a right to an oral hearing. Counsel relied on
Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177; 58 N.R. 1; 14 C.R.R. 13; 17 D.L.R.(4th) 422, in which it was held that fundamental justice in the circumstances of that case required an oral hearing where serious issues of credibility were involved. While I can appreciate that in appropriate cases an oral hearing may be a requirement of fundamental justice. I do not see that to be the case in the context of proceedings involving involuntary transfers where certain information originates with informers. In these cases, not all parties are before the decision-maker at the same time. There can be no opportunity for cross-examination. The cases suggest that an oral hearing is not a requirement in these circumstances. (See

Williams et al. v. Correctional Service of Canada et al.
(1991), 38 F.T.R. 169, at p. 174.)
