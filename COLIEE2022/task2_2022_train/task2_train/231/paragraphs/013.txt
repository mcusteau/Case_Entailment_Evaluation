The process followed in these cases by the prison officials appear to have been guided by the commissioner's directives entitled
Transfer of Inmates
dated July 12, 1991. Counsel explained that commissioner's directives have been held not to have the force of law but are considered merely directions as to the manner of carrying out duties in the administration of correctional institutions. (See
Martineau and Butters v. Matsqui Institution Inmate Disciplinary Board
, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 118; 14 N.R. 285; 74 D.L.R.(3d) 1; 33 C.C.C.(2d) 366 at p. 129 S.C.R.). However, where a directive codifies a principle of common law or, with reference to correctional institutions, applies provisions of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
or other statutes, such codification would, of course, have the force of law, not because of the commissioner's directive per se, but because of the underlying legal force of what is codified.
