  How could the Commission possibly cut short its investigation of the fourth complaint, H47999? It simply will not do to try to draw a distinction between the Commission's investigator, and the Commission. We are speaking of one organization ( 
 S.E.P.Q.A. 
 , supra). The investigation report clearly states that it was intended that other witnesses be interviewed before Dr. Grover made his request for a stay. Since the stay was not granted, that cannot be the reason the interviews were aborted. Why then did the Commission decide that the fourth complaint was inextricably tied in with the other two? Over the years there had been a change of personnel. I agree with  
 Kamani 
 , supra, and say there is an obligation on the part of the Commission to investigate the fourth complaint before deciding either to refer it to the Tribunal or to dismiss it.
