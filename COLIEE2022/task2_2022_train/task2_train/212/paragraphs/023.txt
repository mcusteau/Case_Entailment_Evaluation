  The Commission's role in considering complaints of discriminatory practices has been considered many times by the courts. The point of embarkation is  
 Syndicat des employés de production du Québec et de l'Acadie v. Commission des droits de la personne et al. 
 , [1989] 2 S.C.R. 879; 100 N.R. 241 (" 
 S.E.P.Q.A. 
 "). The scheme of the  
 Act 
  was dealt with at some length by Sopinka, J. In that case the Commission investigated a complaint and then decided not to refer it to the Tribunal. It was held that in such circumstances the Commission had to determine whether there was a reasonable foundation in the evidence for proceeding to the next stage. The Commission was not required to comply with the formal rules of natural justice but was required to act with procedural fairness. The Commission's failure in that case to give reasons was not a basis for review as the basis of its conclusion was to be found in the report of its investigators which had been made available to the parties who, therefore, were fully apprised of the reasons for the Commission's decision.
