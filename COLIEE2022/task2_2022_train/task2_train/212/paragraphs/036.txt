  In  
 MacLean v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al. 
  (2003), 243 F.T.R. 219; 2003 FC 1459, O'Keefe, J., applied and pragmatic and functional analysis in a case in which the Commission decided not to send a complaint to the Tribunal. He noted there was no privative clause, that the Commission was experienced in fact finding in terms of screening complaints and that it had discretion to dismiss complaints. All this favoured deference. He was of the view that the issue was a mixed one of fact and law which should be reviewed on the standard of reasonableness simpliciter. Gibson, J., came to the same conclusion in  
 Gardiner v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2004), 250 F.T.R. 131; 2004 FC 483. I agree.
