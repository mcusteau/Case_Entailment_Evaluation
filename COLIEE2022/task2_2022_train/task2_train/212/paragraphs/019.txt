 [19] 
  Any individual, such as Dr. Grover, or group of individuals, having reasonable grounds for believing that a person is or has engaged in a discriminatory practice may file a complaint with the Commission. A complaint may be limited to alleged discrimination against a particular individual, as in this case, or may allege a discriminatory practice which could affect thousands, such as the methodology by which family allowance payments are made, or pay equity. In accordance with Part III of the  
 Act 
 , currently sections 39 and following, upon receipt of a complaint such as Dr. Grover's, the Commission can do one of two things. It can decide either to investigate the complaint, or not to investigate. It may deal with the complaint without investigation if it thinks the alleged victim ought to exhaust grievance or review procedures otherwise reasonably available, if the complaint could more appropriately be dealt with under another act of Parliament, if the complaint is beyond its jurisdiction, if it is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith, or if based on acts or omissions the last of which occurred more than one year, or such longer period as the Commission considers appropriate, before the complaint was filed. Although the events occurred more than one year before Dr. Grover's last complaint was filed, the Commission decided to deal with it as Dr. Grover's employment situation had been constantly before it. That part of the decision is not under attack.
