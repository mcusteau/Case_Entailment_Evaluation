 [6] 
  The present amendment sought by each of Monsanto and Mycogen deal with a submission made by patent agents acting for Bayer to the Canadian Patent Office during the course of prosecuting its patent application involved in those conflict proceedings. In a response to an office action, Bayer's agents drew the patent examiner's attention to certain statements made in an affidavit of Jansens filed with the United States Patent Office in the course of prosecuting an application there. A copy of that affidavit was submitted to the patent examiner.
