  In general the Court will allow amendments to pleadings provided such amendments will not result in an injustice to the opposite party that cannot be compensated in costs and that it would serve the interests of justice. I cite, from the many examples, the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Canderel Ltd. v. Canada 
 , [1994] 1 F.C. 3 at paragraph 9: 
 
 
 
 With respect to amendments, it may be stated, as a result of the decisions of this Court in North- west Airporter Bus Service Ltd. v. The Queen and Minister of Transport; The Queen v. Special Risks Holdings Inc.; Meyer v. Canada; Glisic v. Canada and Francoeur v. Canada and of the decision of the House of Lords in Ketteman v. Hansel Properties Ltd which was referred to in Francoeur, that while it is impossible to enumerate all the factors that a judge must take into consideration in determining whether it is just, in a given case, to authorize an amendment, the general rule is that an amendment should be allowed at any stage of an action for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties, provided, notably, that the allowance would not result in an injustice to the other party not capable of being compensated by an award of costs and that it would serve the interests of justice.
