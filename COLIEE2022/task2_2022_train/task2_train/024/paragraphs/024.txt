  My comments have to do with paragraphs 13 and 14 of Monsanto's proposed amendments. I am advised by Monsanto's counsel that the wording of paragraph 13 is taken almost verbatim from paragraph 12 of Justice Sharlow's decision in the Federal Court (as she then was) in  
 Connaught Laboratories Ltd. v. Medeva Pharma Ltd 
  (1999), 4 C.P.R. (4th) 508: 
 
 
 
 12 The broad principle underlying the prothonotary's decision is that a claim should be struck only if it is plain and obvious that the claim will fail: Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959. The first step in the analysis is to examine the proposed legal arguments as set out in paragraph 25, which are based on one or more of "res judicata, issue estoppel, collateral estoppel, comity, abuse of process." These are different expressions of the general principle that judicial proceedings must at some point be conclusive, that an issue of fact need only be decided once.
