  Bayer's counsel argued that there is no statutory basis which would call for a duty of candour on behalf of an applicant for a patent, nor is there any statutory penalties provided for lack of candour. Further, Bayer's counsel argues that there is no common law or other non-statutory duty of candour nor penalties for lack of candour. Thus, says Bayer's counsel, even if one assumes that the allegations made in the amendments are true, which Bayer must accept for the purpose of the motion but not otherwise, there are no consequences and no relief can be claimed by Monsanto or Mycogen as a result.
