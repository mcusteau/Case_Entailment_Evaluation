  In the present case Bayer does not allege any prejudice nor does it argue that the amendments were not sought in a timely manner. Bayer rests its argument on the sole basis that the amendments sought do not raise an issue that can properly be determined in the context of the present actions. In so doing Bayer's counsel refers to the reasons of the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Nidek Co. Ltd. v. Visx Inc. 
  (1996), 72 C.P.R. (3rd) 19 per Isaac CJ for the Court at page 24: 
 
 
 
 In determining whether an amendment to a defence should be allowed, it is often helpful for the Court to ask itself whether the amendment, if it was already part of the proposed pleadings, would be a plea capable of being struck out under Rule 419. If yes, the amendment should not be allowed. See, for example, Chrysler Canada Ltd. v. The Queen, [1978] 1 F.C. 137 (T.D.). Procedurally, the Court will not receive any evidence where the basis for striking out paragraphs in a statement of defence is alleged to be that they disclose no reasonable defence (Rule 419(1)(a)). Rule 419(2) expressly prohibits the use of evidence on a Rule 419(1)(a) motion. In similar fashion, the Court should not accept any evidence in support of an application for leave to amend pleadings under Rule 420, unless evidence is required in order to clarify the nature of the proposed amendments. Rather, the Court must assume that the facts pleaded in the amendments are true for the purposes of considering whether or not to grant leave to amend.
