  In my view, Justice Sharlow was not proposing a model plea, she was simply repeating parts of the plea at issue before her. Bayer's counsel argues that paragraph 13 lacks particularization as to what portions of Justice Webber's findings in the United States case are being put in issue and contrasts this plea with Mycogen's proposed plea at paragraphs 18 and 22. I agree, paragraph 13 requires particularization before the amendment is allowed.
