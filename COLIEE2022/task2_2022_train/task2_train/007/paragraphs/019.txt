 [19] 
  The applicant submitted that until the respondent has entered evidence that contradicts that of the applicant, the applicant's evidence must be accepted and no adverse inference is justified. The applicant indicated in his affidavit that he was unaware that his consultant had filed inaccurate information until his interview. The applicant submitted that the fact that the applicant did not provide this information to the officer during the interview, and only provided it in his affidavit for this application, does not permit the Court to draw a negative inference.
