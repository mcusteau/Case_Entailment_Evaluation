  The respondent submitted that the applicant's argument cannot succeed for three reasons. Firstly, the respondent submitted that the applicant cannot assert that he corrected the wrong information at the first available opportunity. The respondent submitted that he, not his consultant, bore the burden of ensuring the information provided was correct. The respondent also submitted that the first opportunity to clarify was when the visa officer began to question him about his job duties. The respondent submitted that instead of correcting the officer, the applicant adopted the falsehood for his benefit, explaining his job duties and what company that he work for. The respondent submitted that it was only when the extent of the misrepresentation came to light that the applicant admitted it. The respondent submitted that to accept the applicant's argument would be to suggest that an applicant need not face the consequences of their falsehoods if they, at the end of the day, after making the falsehood and testing it would slip by, are caught and then admit their misrepresentation.
