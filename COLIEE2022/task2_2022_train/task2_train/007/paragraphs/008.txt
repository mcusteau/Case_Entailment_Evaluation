Paragraph 40(2)(a) specifies that the foreign national continues to be inadmissible for misrepresentation for a period of two years following, in the case of determination outside Canada, a final determination of inadmissibility under subsection (1). You stated on your application that you had been employed as a computer programmer from 10/02 to present. You were questioned at interview regarding this specific work experience. You admitted at interview that you had never been employed during this period as a computer programmer. You misrepresented a material fact that could have induced an error in the administration of the Act in that you could have been awarding points for paid work experience which you did not possess. As a result, you are inadmissible to Canada for a period of two years from the date of this letter.
