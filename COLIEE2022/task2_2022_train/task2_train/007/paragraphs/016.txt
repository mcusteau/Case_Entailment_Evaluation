 Re Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Limited, 
  [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, the words of an act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the act, the object of the act, and the intention of Parliament. The respondent submitted that paragraph 40(1)(a) renders a person inadmissible for making a misrepresentation that "induces or could induce" an error in the administration of the Act. The respondent submitted that this phrasing captures situation such as the one in this case. Furthermore, the respondent submitted that the applicant's interpretation is inconsistent with the requirement in the Act to provide truthful information. Moreover, the respondent submitted that the applicant's interpretation is also inconsistent with the context within which the provision is found as the Act requires that a person advise of material changes in their circumstances pertinent to their immigration applications as those changes occur. Finally, the respondent submitted that the applicant's interpretation cannot hold as it creates an absurdity.
