  Justice MacKay in Merck Frost Canada Inc v. Canada (Minister of Health), [1997] F.C.J. no. 1273, dealt with a situation where an application was brought to challenge the Minister of Healthâ€™s decision to issue a NOC to Apotex with regard to Apo-lovastatin but where the Applicant, Merck, sought to amend their allegations of fact so that they could challenge a number of decisions made by the Minister of Health, which lead to the issue of the NOC, in one application. At paragraph 25 of his decision, Justice MacKay wrote the following in what concerned the application of Rule 1602(4) of the Federal Court Rules, which has since been replaced by Rule 302: 
 
 
 
 Adding a request for an order to revoke or suspend the decision of the Minister of July 11, 1997, in my opinion, would be inappropriate. An application for judicial review by the Court's Rule 1602(4) is to be with regard to a single decision, or failure to decide, and here the original and the amended notice of motion already seek review of the Minister's decision of March 26, 1997 to issue an NOC to Apotex with regard to its Apo-lovastatin product. At the hearing of this application counsel for Merck confirmed that the decision of March 26 is the key decision here sought to be set aside. While it was urged at the hearing that the amended detailed allegations of fact sought to be introduced make clear that Merck seeks to challenge in this proceeding the whole series of decisions made on behalf of the Minister leading to the issue of the NOC and its subsequent amendment, this would only be relevant to the extent the prior process is by law, or practice of the Minister, an integral aspect of the decision in question.  
 Judicial review is not a proceeding to review an ongoing and continuous process; rather, its purpose, aside from declaratory relief, is to review a particular decision or action, or lack of decision or action if that is required by law
