  In the case at hand, the two decisions which the Applicants seek to have reviewed cannot be considered part of a “continuing course of conduct” given the Court’s case law relating to Rule 302. First, the two decisions in question were made at different times; the first was made on December 12, 2005, the second on February 1, 2007. The two decisions relate to different factual situations and were made under distinct statutory regimes each with their own decision making process: on December 12, 2005 Health Canada found that the PMNOC Regulations did not apply to Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets; whereas on February 1, 2007, Health Canada issued a NOC for Apotex’s Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets under the Food & Drug Regulations. Furthermore, the Applicants seek two different types of relief: for the December 12, 2005 decision, the Applicants seek among their prayers for relief that are not academic given that an NOC was issued to Apotex for Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets, a declaration that the PMNOC Regulations as amended on October 5, 2006 apply to the pending ANDS filed by Apotex in respect of Apo-perindopril 2, 4 and 8 mg tablets and an order that Apotex comply with subsection 5(1) of the PMNOC Regulations; whereas for the February 1, 2007, the Applicants seek an order requiring the Minister of Health to revoke the NOC issued. Therefore, I can but conclude that the amendments being sought by the Applicants to their Original Application relate to another decision, namely the February 1, 2007 decision by Health Canada to issue a NOC to Apotex for Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets. The issuance of an NOC to Apotex on February 1, 2007 is a distinct and separate decision from the December 12, 2005 decision of the Minister finding that the PMNOC Regulations do not apply to Apo-perindopril in 8 mg tablets, the decision which is the subject of the Original Application. So as to conform with Rule 302, the Applicants must seek leave of this Court to proceed with a review of two decisions in one application, in the case at hand, leave was not sought.
