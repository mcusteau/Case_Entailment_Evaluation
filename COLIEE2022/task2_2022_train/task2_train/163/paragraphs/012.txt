  Rule 302 has been interpreted as establishing that an application for judicial review shall be limited to a single decision, unless the Court orders otherwise, and thus, where the review of multiple decisions is sought, an application for each decision must be filed (see Jazz Air LP v. Toronto Port Authority, 2006 FC 705 at para. 12, Human Rights Institute of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Public Works & Government Services), [2000] 1 F.C. 475).
