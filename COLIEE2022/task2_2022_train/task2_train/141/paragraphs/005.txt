  As mentioned, Mr. Ilahi kept in close contact with the visa office. For example, he sent two letters in August 2001 notifying the office of a change of address and his new fax number. He also asked that he be given 2-3 monthsâ€™ notice of an interview because of the difficulty of traveling between Lahore and Islamabad. In 2002, he confirmed his coordinates and asked that his interview notice be sent by courier, for which he would gladly pay. In August 2002, he specifically requested an early interview and repeated his offer to pay for a courier. His consultant supplied another change of address in June 2005. It is clear that Mr. Ilahi diligently pursued his application and did everything necessary to ensure that he would receive all correspondence from the visa office.
