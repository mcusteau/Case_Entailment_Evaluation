  The respondent argues that the officer met his obligation by sending a letter to Mr. Ilahi by regular mail in November 2005, informing him of an interview the following month. The electronic notes on Mr. Ilahi’s file indicate that a letter was indeed sent to him after his address had been verified in his paper file. However, the respondent cannot produce a copy of that letter. Nor does it have any direct evidence of the address to which it was sent. It asks me to infer that the letter was sent to the correct address because the subsequent letter, informing Mr. Ilahi that his application was denied, was sent to the correct address and was duly received. However, I cannot draw this inference without a copy of the letter, or an indication in the electronic notes as to where the letter was sent. There would have been at least three different addresses in Mr. Ilahi’s paper file. I cannot conclude, without any direct evidence on the point, that the officer used the correct address.
