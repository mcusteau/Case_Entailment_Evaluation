  In the later proceedings [see footnote 5], on status review pursuant to the Court's  
 Rules 
 , I dismissed an action, initiated by the plaintiff in 1990, after considering written representations and oral submissions heard by telephone conference. In that matter Mr. Black represented the plaintiff on the basis of approval by Mr. Giles, granted in 1993, on a motion by Mr. Black for leave to repreÂ­sent his corporation [see footnote 6], NsC Corp. That approval, of course, related only to that action, as the subsequent order by Mr. Justice Richard on May 24, 1995 in Court file T-724-95 clearly implied.
