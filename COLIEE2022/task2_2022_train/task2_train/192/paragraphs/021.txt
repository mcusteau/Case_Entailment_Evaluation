  The decision of an immigration officer with respect to the eligibility of a refugee claimant was also considered in  
 Tchassovnikov v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1998), 152 F.T.R. 144. In that decision, Mr. Justice Campbell relied, at p. 145, on the  
 Chan 
  decision and found that a reconsideration of the applicant's eligibility should have taken place: 
 
 
 
 "On November 13, 1996, the applicants' counsel sent a letter to Immigration Canada requesting a reconsideration of the July 12, 1995 ineligibility finding on the basis of new evidence. This request for reconsideration was denied on November 17, 1997 on the following ground: 
 
 
 
 'The decision at issue may not be revisited on the basis of the functus principle and it does not appear that, notwithstanding the rule of functus, one of the exceptions apply to this case.' 
 
 
 
 "This is the decision under review in this application. 
 
 
 
 "Regarding whether an error of law has been made in reaching the decision under review on the functus principle, I find the decision of Cullen, J., in  
 Chan v. MCI 
  [1996] 3 F.C. 349 to be compelling authority. In that case, Cullen, J., decided that a visa officer has jurisdiction to reconsider a decision made, particularly when new information comes to light. 
 
 
 
 "I find it reasonable to extend Cullen, J.'s, reasoning in  
 Chan 
  to the Senior Immigration Officer's decision in this case. Accordingly, I find the Senior Immigration Officer's decision of November 17, 1997 to be based on an error in law. 
 
 
 
 "As the reason for requesting the reconsideration stems from a letter from the Spanish authorities dated April 24th, 1995, which places the original decision reached in this case on July 12, 1995 in significant doubt, I set the decision of November 17, 1997 aside and refer this matter to another immigration officer for redetermination ..."
