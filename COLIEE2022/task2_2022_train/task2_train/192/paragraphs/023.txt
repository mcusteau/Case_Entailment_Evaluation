  It is in that context, then, that I will consider the present application. This is not a situation in which the applicant is trying to avoid the expiration of a limitation period. It is not a circumstance where the relevant immigration officer has responded by explaining his earlier decision because that is all he considers necessary as a response. The letter that was sent was not a courtesy letter refusing to reconsider the application. The immigration officer undertook a reconsideration of the applicant's application for landing but, for whatever reason, ignored the new evidence that had been presented as the basis for the reconsideration request. As such, the decision should be set aside unless the immigration officer had no authority to undertake the reconsideration.
