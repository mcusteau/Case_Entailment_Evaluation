  Subsequent to the  
 Soimu 
  and  
 Dumbrava 
  decisions, the same issue was addressed with respect to decisions of senior immigration officials. In  
 Kandasamy v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1996), 119 F.T.R. 262; 36 Imm. L.R.(2d) 237, an applicant had been determined not to be eligible to have his claim to be a convention refugee determined because he was a convention refugee in Germany, the latter fact being one with which the applicant agreed. Subsequent to that decision, the applicant learned from his father that he had not been accepted as a convention refugee in Germany. He sought to have his ineligibility finding reconsidered. The senior immigration officer refused on the ground that the information on which the applicant was now relying "could reasonably have been expected to have been available at [the] time of" the first decision - it was not new information that was coming to light for the first time. Mr. Justice MacKay held that there was a serious issue raised by the applicant's argument (the issue before Mr. Justice MacKay was whether a stay of the execution of a deportation order should be granted). The decision of the senior immigration officer refusing to reconsider the applicant's eligibility was subsequently set aside, on consent, and referred back for reconsideration with respect to the new documentary evidence the applicant had submitted that he had not been granted refugee status in Germany. (Order rendered by Mr. Justice Gibson on March 3, 1997.)
