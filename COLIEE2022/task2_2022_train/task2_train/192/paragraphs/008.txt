  On May 5, 1997, the applicant was informed by the relevant immigration officer that his application might have to be refused because he was not in possession of a passport, identity or travel document. The applicant was given 30 days to respond. The applicant's counsel responded, explaining again the difficulty the applicant was having in obtaining a passport from the embassy. The letter enclosed a copy of the applicant's birth certificate and suggested that it be used instead.
