  A situation such as the present is different from those in which the second "consideration" is not a reconsideration but an explanation of the earlier decision, or in which a courtesy letter is sent in response to the request to reopen the earlier decision, see, for example,  
 Wong v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1995] F.C.J. No. 685 and  
 Dhaliwal v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1995] F.C.J. No. 982. Indeed, in some instances a request for a reconsideration may be nothing more than an attempt by counsel for the applicant to avoid the expiration of the time limit within which judicial review of the first decision might be commenced, see  
 Dhaliwal 
  (supra) and  
 Wong 
  (supra).
