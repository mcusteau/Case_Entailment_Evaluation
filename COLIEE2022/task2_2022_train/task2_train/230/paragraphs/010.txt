The second factor to consider is the expertise of the decision-maker relative to the Court. Section 18 of the
Board Act
describes the function of the Board to have exclusive jurisdiction to decide all claims made to it under the
Pension Act
and matters incidental thereto. While the Board does not have greater expertise than the Court on questions of legal interpretation of both
Acts
, the Board decides pension entitlement cases and has greater expertise than the Court in deciding the merits of those claims. Accordingly, this factor favours deference to the Board on questions squarely within its preserve, including the weighing of contradictory evidence and the determination of whether a claim is pensionable. Less deference is owed to the Board on legal questions, including the interpretation of the rules of evidence that apply to pension applicants under section 39 of the
Board Act
.
