On November 30, 2004 the appeal panel of the Board dismissed the applicant's appeal from the review panel's rejection. The Board held that the inversion sprain first arose in 1986, and that recurrent sprains reported from 1986 to 1997 preceded the pes planus diagnosis. The appeal panel concluded there was no credible evidence to establish the applicant's inversion sprain was consequential to his established pes planus conditions. By way of Notice of Application dated January 25, 2005 the applicant seeks judicial review of this decision.
