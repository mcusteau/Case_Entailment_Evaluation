[23]
The Court will refer this matter back to another panel of the Board for redetermination to weigh the evidence and apply the statutory burden of proof. If the Board concludes that the applicant's recurrent inversion sprains of his right ankle are consequential to the applicant's pes planus, as contemplated by subsection 21(5) of the
Pension Act
, the Board must take into account that the applicant is already receiving a small pension (one fifth of ten percent) with respect to this same ankle injury.
