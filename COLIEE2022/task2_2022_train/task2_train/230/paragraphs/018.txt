The Board stated at page 2 of its reasons:
"In preparation for this hearing,
the Board has reviewed any previous decisions relevant to this case and has examined all evidence
, which includes testimony and documented evidence, in addition to the following:
EA-Y1: Report from Dr. W. David Saunders, dated 5 July 2004; and
EA-Attach-Y1: Five page report, dated 14 January 2003, from Dr. Thomas D. Loane." (Emphasis added)
If the Board had reviewed "any previous decisions relevant to this case and examined all evidence", as it states it did, it must have read its previous decision dated June 27, 2003 which was in relation to Mr. Youden's pes planus conditions. It must also have read Dr. Saunders' statement dated 24 December 2002 that he had in fact examined the applicant. All previous decisions rendered by the Board in respect of pension claims for pes planus are relevant to the decision under review, since the claim being decided was alleged to be dependent on the established pes planus condition. In this case, the Board's failure to refer to Dr. Saunders' evidence that he was the applicant's physician disregarded the evidence of their doctor-patient history and Dr. Saunders physical examination.
Issue No. 2
: Did the Board fail to apply the statutory burden of proof under the Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act, S.C. 1995, c. 18?
