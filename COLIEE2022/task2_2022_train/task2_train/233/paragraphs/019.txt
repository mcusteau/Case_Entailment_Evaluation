The respondent essentially repeats the RPD's findings. In his opinion, the applicant's crime is a serious non-political crime and the sentence he was given has not been fully served. The respondent further argues that even if the sentence was considered to be fully served the seriousness of the crime that was committed warrants the applicant's exclusion nevertheless. On the question of the sufficiency of the reasons, the respondent argues that the decision is sufficiently detailed to understand its basis and to follow the RPD's reasoning.
