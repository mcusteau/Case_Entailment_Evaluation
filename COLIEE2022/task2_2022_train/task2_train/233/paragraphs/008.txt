In respect of exclusion, the RPD relied on the judgments in
Chan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship)
, [2000] 4 F.C. 390; 260 N.R. 376 (F.C.A.) and
Zrig v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration)
, [2003] 3 F.C. 761; 307 N.R. 201; 2003 FCA 178; [2003] F.C.J. No. 565. The RPD thought that paragraph 1F(b) of the
Convention
applied to the applicant, a serious non-political crime having been committed and the applicant's sentence not having been fully served. Furthermore, the RPD emphasized the seriousness of the crime and the importance of the punishments associated with it under both Canadian and U.S. law.
