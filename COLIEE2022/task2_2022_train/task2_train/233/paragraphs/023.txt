To determine whether a crime is serious, we can refer to the penalty provided in Canadian law (see
Xie v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] 2 F.C.R. 372; 239 F.T.R. 59; 2003 FC 1023, affd. by [2005] 1 F.C.R. 304; 325 N.R. 255; 2004 FCA 250 and
Xu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. A39; 2005 FC 970; [2005] F.C.J. No. 1193, at paragraph 30). The crime for which the applicant was convicted amounts in Canadian law to conspiracy to possess drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The relevant provisions are the following:
"
