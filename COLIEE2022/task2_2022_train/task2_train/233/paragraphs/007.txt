With respect to inclusion, Mr. Graub noted various inconsistencies in the applicant's story, drawn from his oral testimony, the immigration officer's notes, his Personal Information Form (PIF) and other immigration documents:
- The applicant gave contradictory versions regarding the purposes of his activism. Sometimes he claimed he was protesting the closure of the plant, while sometimes he said he wanted it to close because of its pollutant emissions. The applicant's explanations at the hearing attempting to justify these different versions were not considered satisfactory;
- The applicant gave contradictory versions of the reasons for his fear (in Appendix 1 of the form "Information on Individuals Seeking Refugee Protection", he writes that he fears one or more [Translation] "family problems" and claims he fears, in particular, [Translation] "a neighbour Guadalupe Ruborcado", while at the hearing he said rather that he feared returning to Mexico because of the plant owners);
- A number of aspects of the applicant's conduct indicate that he did not really fear persecution (delay in requesting asylum, failure to tell the immigration officer that he feared persecution if he returned to Mexico, statements about his desire to return to Mexico, the stated objective of immigration to Canada for economic reasons); and
- The applicant's passport application, prior to the threats he received, is a fact tending to show that it was not out of fear of persecution that the applicant claimed refugee status.
