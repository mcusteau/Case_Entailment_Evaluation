The applicant argues that exclusion does not apply in his case. In his opinion, his sentence was served and a person who has served his sentence should not be excluded. He argues that he should have been entitled to adduce evidence of good conduct and that the fact that he has been on probation since his removal to Mexico in June 2004 should not be held against him. Finally, the applicant submits that the RPD has not provided sufficient reasons on the issue of exclusion.
