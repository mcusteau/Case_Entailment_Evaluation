The Respondent argues that the interpretation of the Adjudicator that the Respondent and her colleagues concluded that the provisions of the Code of Conduct did not apply to bank tellers was confined to receipt of "business gifts". She submits that there was no suggestion made that the entire Code of Conduct did not apply to bank tellers. Furthermore, she argues that whatever determination was made by her and her colleagues with respect to the applicability of those provisions of the Code of Conduct does not determine the real question before the Adjudicator, whether her dismissal was unjust.
