In these circumstances, despite the considerable deference owed to the Adjudicator with respect to his credibility findings, I conclude that it was patently unreasonable that he did not address the contradictory evidence before him and further, that he failed to provide reasons in clear and unmistakable terms, for preferring one version of events over another. Specifically, I find it to be unreasonable for the Adjudicator not to have acknowledged that Ms. Lachappelle testified that she did not tell the Respondent that the Code of Conduct was inapplicable to bank tellers.
