The applicable standard of review with respect to the Adjudicator's analysis of the Code of Conduct is patent unreasonableness. Since he failed to address a fundamental issue, that is whether the Respondent's acceptance of the $5,000 gift amounted to a breach of the Code of Conduct, I conclude that the Adjudicator's decision was patently unreasonable. There is clear support in the jurisprudence for the conclusion that an Adjudicator makes a patently unreasonable decision by failing to answer the question before him or her; see
Fraser v. Public Service Staff Relations Board
, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 455; 63 N.R. 161. This decision is relevant, in my opinion, even though it was made in the context of labour arbitration in the Public Service.
