The Respondent argues that minor variations in the specific evidence of one of her colleagues, that is Ms. Lachappelle, does not detract from the Adjudicator's generalized conclusion that she spoke to three of her colleagues and arrived at a conclusion that the Code of Conduct did not apply to bank tellers. Further, in response to the Applicant's arguments concerning the investigator's interview with the Respondent, it is submitted that the Adjudicator specifically commented on that evidence in his reasons. He described the circumstances of the interview, including the fact that the Respondent had not been given time to prepare herself. He found that rather than being dishonest in her answers, the Respondent was confused and bewildered and did her best to be truthful in a stressful experience.
