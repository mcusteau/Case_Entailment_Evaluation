If the Adjudicator fairly and without proven bias or proven apprehension of bias, operates within the four corners of s. 242 and particularly s. 242(3.1) and (4), he is complying with the will of Parliament. Section 243 of the
Labour Code
, requires that a decision of an adjudicator, despite any minor errors of procedure, fact and law, short of patent unreasonableness, shall not be disturbed upon judicial review. In
Aziz v. Telesat Canada
(1995), 104 F.T.R. 267 (T.D.), Heald, J., at paragraph 19 summarized the applicable standards of review in respect of decisions rendered by an Adjudicator, following analysis of the relevant jurisprudence in that regard:
"To summarize, the relevant jurisprudence clearly establishes that the standard of review relating to errors of fact and law is the high or strict test of patent unreasonableness. It also establishes that the lower standard of correctness applies where the errors relate to provisions defining the jurisdiction of an adjudicator."
