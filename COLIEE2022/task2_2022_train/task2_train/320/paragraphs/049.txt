The Respondent submits that the ultimate question before the Adjudicator was whether her termination was unjust, not whether there was a breach of the Code of Conduct. The Adjudicator considered the history of the Respondent's employment with the Applicant, the circumstances surrounding the gift, the ambiguity of the Code of Conduct and the Bank's reaction, and concluded that the termination was unjust. The Respondent argued that the Adjudicator's decision is not deficient nor was it made without jurisdiction, simply because he did not expressly state whether there was a breach of the Code of Conduct.
