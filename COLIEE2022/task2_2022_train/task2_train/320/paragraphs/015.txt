The Applicant raised a procedural matter, that is an alleged breach of procedural fairness flowing from the failure of the Adjudicator to permit re-examination of a witness, that is Ms. Teri Lachappelle. Counsel for the Applicant had asked this witness whether she had told the Respondent that the Code of Conduct did not apply to tellers. Ms. Lachappelle answered in the negative. Counsel for the Respondent then asked Ms. Lachappelle if she thought that certain Articles, that is Articles 11 and 12, were confusing and the witness gave a positive answer. The Adjudicator did not permit counsel for the Applicant to re-examine on this point.
