The Applicant argues that the Code of Conduct has been interpreted and applied in a number of decisions which were argued before the Adjudicator. It has been found to form part of the conditions of employment of Royal Bank employees, pursuant to the decision in
Alleyne v. Royal Bank of Canada
, [1998] C.L.A.D. No. 804. The Applicant further submits that numerous adjudicators have concluded that the Bank's practice of providing the Code of Conduct to its employees on an annual basis and requiring their acknowledgment of receipt and review of the Code of Conduct is sufficient that employees are familiar with its content; see
M. v. Royal Bank of Canada
, [2000] C.L.A.D. No. 149;
Cowan v. Royal Bank of Canada
, [2003] C.L.A.D. No. 292;

, [1996] C.L.A.D. No. 1125; and
