Heneghan, J.
: The Royal Bank of Canada (the "Applicant") seeks judicial review of the decision of Mr. Brian Noonan, sitting as an Adjudicator (the "Adjudicator") appointed pursuant to s. 242 of the
Canada Labour Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-2, as amended (the "
Labour Code
"). In that decision, the Adjudicator determined that the Applicant had unjustly dismissed Ms. Darlene Siu (the "Respondent") from her employment and ordered the Applicant to pay damages for loss of income and emotional distress, as well as pre-judgment interest and costs. Further, the Adjudicator ordered the Applicant to provide a letter of reference for the Respondent, outlining her thirty years of service and omitting any reference to her dismissal.
