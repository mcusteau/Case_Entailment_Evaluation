[17]
A review of the record in this case suggests that the Officer improperly limited his consideration of the Applicants' application for reinstatement of status to the length of time required for the Respondent's employees to deal with processing of the inland sponsorship application without addressing the existence or otherwise of a current "temporary purpose" for the Applicants' stay in Canada. Accordingly, this application for judicial review is allowed and the matter remitted to a different officer for redetermination. There is no question for certification arising.
