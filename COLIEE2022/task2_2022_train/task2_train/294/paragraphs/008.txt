The Applicants submit that the Officer ignored relevant evidence in reaching the negative decision, specifically the evidence relating to the fact that the application was one in the family class, that the male Applicant's mother had recently died, that he was a beneficiary of her estate and his presence was required to deal with administration of that estate and that the Applicants' son Igor desired that his parents remain in Canada with him for emotional support. According to the Applicants, this was all relevant information that was before the Officer but there was no indication that he considered any of these facts when making his decision.
