The same distinction was made in Guerrero v. Canada(Minister of citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 104, [2004] F.C.J. No. 120, at para. 22. In Varga v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 617, [2005] F.C.J. No. 765, at para. 27 to 30, Justice Mactavish found a psychological report irrelevant to the issue of state protection and noted that it is the RPD's jurisdiction to weight the evidence:
Ms. Varga also submits that the Board erred in failing to give adequate reasons for placing little weight of a psychological report prepared by Dr. J. Pilowsky. Dr. Pilowsky concluded that Ms. Varga suffers from Post-traumatic Stress Disorder as a consequence of her experiences. According to the doctor, Ms. Varga would suffer a "complete psychological breakdown and retraumatization" if she were forced to return to Hungary.
In its reasons, the Board noted that it had reviewed Dr. Pilowsky's report, but stated that it preferred to place greater weight on the documentary evidence, observing that it came from a variety of sources with no interest in the outcome.
The question of how much weight should be ascribed to individual pieces of evidence is one for the Board. Moreover, in this case, the issue before the Board was whether adequate state protection would be available to Ms. Varga if she were to return to Hungary. It is difficult to see how evidence of a psychologist practising in the City of Toronto could shed any light on this question, and indeed, Dr. Pilowsky does not purport to do so.
While Ms. Varga's psychological condition could potentially justify favourable consideration under other provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, the central question for the Board was whether Ms. Varga's fear of persecution in Hungary was objectively well-founded. Dr. Pilowsky's report was simply not relevant to this inquiry. As a consequence, there is no merit to Ms. Varga's submissions in this regard.
