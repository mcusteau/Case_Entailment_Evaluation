Justice Shore went on and referred to the authoritative Federal Court of Appeal case, Hassan v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1992] F.C.J. No. 946. In this case, the Federal Court of Appeal dealt with subsections 2(2) and 2(3) of the former Immigration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2:
It is clear, as the appellant suggests, that subsections 2(2) and 2(3) of the Immigration Act speak to the loss of status as a Convention refugee because of, inter alia, a change in material circumstance in a refugee's home nation. But those provisions in no way alter the test used to initially determine a claimant's status. It is trite law that to establish status as a Convention refugee within the meaning of the Immigration Act, one has to meet both a subjective and objective threshold. One must have a "well-founded fear of persecution". One cannot get to the point of possibly losing one's status as a Convention refugee, i.e. subsections 2(2) and 2(3) cannot be applicable, unless one first falls within the statutory definition contained in subsection 2(1) [my emphasis].
