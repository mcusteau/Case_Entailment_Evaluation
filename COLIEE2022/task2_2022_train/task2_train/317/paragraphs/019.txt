In my view, sub. 108(4) of the IRPA is not applicable in the present matter. The RPD should not undertake a sub. 108(4) evaluation in every case. It is only when para. 108(1)(e) is invoked by the RPD that a "compelling reasons" assessment should me made, i.e. when the refugee claimant was found to be a refugee but nevertheless had been be denied refugee status given the change of circumstances in the country of origin. In Kalumba c. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration), 2005 CF 680, [2005] A.C.F. No. 879, at para. 18 and 19, Justice Shore provided a succinct summary of the applicable principles:
[MY TRANSLATION] As per the wording of the section, before considering the application of subsection 108(4) of the Act, the Commission must conclude that the person would have been granted refugee status notwithstanding the change of circumstances which occurred in the country. In the matter at hand, the Commission determined that M. Kalumba had an internal flight alternative in his country of origin and therefore concluded that Mr. Kalumba was neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection as per sections 96 and 97 of the Act.
Secondly, the Commission never mentions in its reasons such a change of circumstances in the RC that would have an effect of depriving the grounds for his fear of persecution. As such, the Commission did not have to conduct a "compelling reasons" analysis pursuant to subsection 108(4) of the Act.
