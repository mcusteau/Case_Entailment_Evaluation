In Carrillo v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 CF 944, [2004] A.C.F. No. 1152, at para. 6 to 8, Justice Snider explained the applicable test where the alleged persecutor is one or several state agents:
In Ward, supra at 724, the Supreme Court of Canada held that, when state protection "might reasonably have been forthcoming", the Board is entitled to draw an adverse inference based on a claimant's failure to approach state authorities for assistance:
Like Hathaway, I prefer to formulate this aspect of the test for fear of persecution as follows: only in situations in which state protection "might reasonably have been forthcoming", will the claimant's failure to approach the state protection defeat his claim. Put another way, the claimant will not meet the definition of "Convention refugee" where it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection of his home authorities; otherwise, the claimant need not literally approach the state.
In my view, whether it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection of home authorities invites the Board to weigh the evidence before it and make a finding of fact. For example, although the agent of persecution might be a stage agent, the facts of the case might suggest that purely local or rogue elements are at work and that the state in question is democratic and offers protection to victims similarly situated to the claimant. It might, therefore, be objectively reasonable to expect a claimant to seek protection. In other instances, the identity of the state agent and documentary evidence of country conditions might mean that state protection would not be reasonably forthcoming and, therefore, the claimant is not expected to have sought protection.
In short, in Justice Snider's opinion, the availability of state protection is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis.
