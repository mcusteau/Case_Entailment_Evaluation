In sum, state protection is an objective issue that has to be assessed regardless of the subjective fear of persecution that refugee claimants might experience. The weighting of the material before the RPD is within its purview, and psychologists' opinion have no relevance with respect to the issue of state protection. The RPD rejected the Applicant's refugee claim because they failed to rebut the presumption of state protection, and this conclusion is not affected by the psychological assessments submitted. Finally, I give no credit to the Applicants argument that the RPD ignored the psychological report, as the RPD explicitly stated that it was taken into consideration (decision, p. 9).
