In J.C.C. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 534, [2005] F.C.J. No. 660, this Court had to deal with a RPD decision where a refugee claim was rejected solely because state protection was found to be available. In that case, as in the present matter, the RPD failed to explicitly address the content of a psychological report. Justice Layden-Stevenson made a distinction between the objective issue of state protection and the subjective fear of persecution that the psychological report emphasized. At para. 18, she wrote:
I also find no error regarding the board's treatment of the psychological report. The report concluded that the applicants would be "at a high risk for retraumatization" should they be forced to return to Costa Rica. However, I agree with the respondent that the report does not deal with the applicants' ability to access state protection in Costa Rica. In my view, the report speaks to the applicants' subjective fear, but it does not assist in relation to the objective issue of state protection.
