The applicants have not demonstrated that the Refugee Division committed a reviewable error or made a patently unreasonable finding when it rejected the authenticity of the applicant's birth certificate. A panel is entitled to rely upon its knowledge regarding the availability of forged documents in a particular region to question their probative value:
Komissarov v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2002 FCT 75. The panel's reliance upon newspaper articles that did not include a specific reference to Armenia is of no consequence. Moreover, the Refugee Division is not obliged to conduct further assessment of a document when there is enough evidence to discredit its authenticity:
Hossain v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 160 at para. 4 (T.D.) (QL);
Wang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2001 FCT 590 at para. 18; and
Akindele v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2002 FCT 37 at par. 5. For these reasons, it was reasonably open for the panel to reject the principal applicant's identity documents.
