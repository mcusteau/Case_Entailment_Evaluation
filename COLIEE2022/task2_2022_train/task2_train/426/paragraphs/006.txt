The appropriate standard for reviewing the Refugee Division's assessment of identity documents is patent unreasonableness:
Adar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1997), 132 F.T.R. 35 at para. 15; and
Mbabazi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2002 FCT 1191 at para. 7. The panel had first-hand access to the identity documents and the testimony of the applicants, and also possesses a high level of expertise in this area.
