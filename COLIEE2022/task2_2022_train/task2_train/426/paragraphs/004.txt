The applicants now seek to have this decision set aside based on alleged errors made by the panel in its assessment of the principal applicant's birth certificate. At the hearing, the principal applicant supplied a birth certificate issued in his name in 2001 and a photocopy of a birth certificate issued in his name in 1972. He testified that he had brought his 1972 birth certificate to Canada, but was unable to present it because it had been lost. The panel found that there are difficulties with the authenticity of identity documents issued in the former republics of the Soviet Union around 2001, and drew a negative inference from the principal applicant's failure to produce his original 1972 birth certificate, which the panel could have tested forensically to prove its authenticity.
