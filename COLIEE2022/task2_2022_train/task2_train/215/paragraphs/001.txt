 Denault, J. 
 : This is an appeal pursuant to rule 336(5) of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
  by the defendant from the order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary Giles dated 19 April 1993, granting leave to the plaintiffs to file an amended statement of claim. The grounds for appeal are that the decision was wrong and that the decision involves a question vital to the final issue of the case. The defendant is seeking to have the decision set aside and requesting that I exercise discretion de novo in determining whether leave to amend the statement of claim should be granted.
