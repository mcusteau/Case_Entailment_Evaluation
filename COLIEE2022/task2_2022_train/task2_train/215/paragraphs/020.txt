  As stated above, the plaintiffs argued that the amendments are necessary to put in issue the validity of the designations made pursuant to s. 194(4) of the  
 Act 
  in order to enable the court to determine the validity of the assessment on the basis of all of the relevant facts. They submit that they were previously unaware that the designations may not be valid and could not have intended to concede this point. The plaintiffs maintain that the Minister is not prejudiced by the amendments because, notwithstanding the expiration of the limitation period in s. 152(4), the third party investors could be pursued to repay the scientific research and experimental development tax credit they received as a result of the designations on the basis of misrepresentation. Also, they maintain that the amendments cause no additional prejudice to the Minister in that the limitation period had already expired for some of the third party investors when the original statement of claim was filed. If it is shown that the amendments may cause prejudice to the defendant, it seems that the plaintiffs submit that this prejudice is compensable by costs and that this prejudice is in part the result of the Minister's failure to discharge its duty to verify the designations when they were made.
