  All of those considerations lead me to conclude that the proposed amendments regarding the designations would cause an irremediable injustice that could not be compensated by an award of costs. Accordingly, the appeal must be allowed and the order of the Associate Senior Prothonotary dated April 19, 1993 granting leave to the plaintiffs to file an amended statement of claim is set aside. The court reserves to the plaintiffs the right to file a revised amended statement of claim not incompatible with this order.
