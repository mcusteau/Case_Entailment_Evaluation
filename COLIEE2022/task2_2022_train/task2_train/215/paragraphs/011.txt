  The plaintiffs filed a statement of claim appealing this assessment on 13 March 1989. The principal issue in the original statement of claim was whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a Part VIII refund on the basis that a number of expenditures constituted scientific research and experimental development expenditures under s. 37(1). There is no mention of the designations, though the statement of claim states at paragraph 9 that "Scannar paid certain amounts in respect of Part VIII Tax [sic] for the 1984 and 1985 fiscal years".
