  The standard of review of a prothonotary's order was set out by Justice MacGuigan in  
 Canada v. Aqua-Gem Investments Ltd. 
 , [1993] 2 F.C. 425, at p. 463; 149 N.R. 273; 93 D.T.C. 5080, at p. 5094, representing the majority of the Federal Court of Appeal sitting on a bench of five judges, when he stated that: 
 
 
 
 "discretionary orders of prothonotaries ought not to be disturbed on appeal to a judge unless: 
 
 
 
 (a) they are clearly wrong in the sense that the exercise of discretion by the prothonotary was based upon the wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts, or 
 
 
 
 (b) they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case. 
 
 
 
 "Where such discretionary orders are clearly wrong in that the prothonotary has fallen into error of law (a concept in which I include a discretion based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts), or where they raise questions vital to the final issue of the case, a judge ought to exercise his own discretion de novo."
