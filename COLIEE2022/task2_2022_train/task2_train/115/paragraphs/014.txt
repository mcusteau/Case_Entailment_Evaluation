  In exercising his duties, the Minister is charged with the management of the fishery and conservation. In  
 Comeau's Sea Foods Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Fisheries and Oceans) 
 , [1997] 1 S.C.R. 12; 206 N.R. 363, at para. 37, Major, J., stated: 
 
 
 
 "This interpretation of the breadth of the Minister's discretion is consonant with the overall policy of the  
 Fisheries Act 
 . Canada's fisheries are a 'common property resource', belonging to all the people of Canada. Under the  
 Fisheries Act 
 , it is the Minister's duty to manage, conserve and develop the fishery on behalf of Canadians in the public interest (s. 43). Licensing is a tool in the arsenal of powers available to the Minister under the  
 Fisheries Act 
  to manage fisheries. It restricts the entry into the commercial fishery, it limits the numbers of fishermen, vessels, gear and other aspects of commercial fishery." 
 
 
 
 These are polycentric considerations requiring the Minister to take a wide variety of interests into account, as opposed to ones in which the government is the singular antagonist of the individual.
