  Considering that it is the duty of the Minister to manage the fisheries and that licensing is a recognized management instrument, the question is whether it is patently unreasonable for the Minister to require that the plaintiff utilize either an inshore licence or offshore licence but not both at the same time. It was explained in evidence that a policy to which the Minister's management of the fishery is directed is to discourage concentration in the industry and that such policy was developed in consultation with participants in the industry. One might argue, as the plaintiff has here, that allowing him to utilize both an inshore and offshore licence at the same time will not increase concentration in the industry in any material way. However, it is not for the Court to judge the wisdom of the anti-concentration policy or whether a less restrictive licensing approach might still be consistent with the policy. Limiting concentration certainly falls within the ambit of the management of the fishery and restricting licences is a means of achieving that objective. Having regard to the Minister's duty to manage the fishery and the unlimited breadth of his section 7 discretion in respect of licensing, there is nothing patently unreasonable about the Minister refusing the plaintiff the opportunity to utilize both an inshore and offshore licence at the same time.
