 [23] 
  The plaintiff relies on  
 Matthews v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1997] 1 F.C. 206; 118 F.T.R. 81 (T.D.), affd. 242 N.R. 181, leave to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada refused (2000), 255 N.R. 398. In  
 Matthews 
 , it was determined that the discretion respecting licensing under section 7 of the  
 Fisheries Act 
  did not include imposing sanctions for an individual's past behaviour. Like in  
 Matthews 
 , the plaintiff here argues that the Minister was not acting within the ambit of the discretion afforded to him under section 7 since, in his submission, the Minister's decision was not related to the management of the fishery.  
 Matthews 
  is simply inapplicable to the case at bar. As is found in paragraph 18, the Minister in the circumstances here was acting in pursuance of the management of the fishery and the decision he made was within the discretion vested in him under section 7.
