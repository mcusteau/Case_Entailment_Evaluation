  There is no vested right in a licence. At paragraph 43 of  
 Comeau 
 , Major, J., stated: 
 
 
 
 "The power to issue the licence, once exercised in any single instance, is expended and may only be revised or revoked under the specific statutory conditions in s. 9. However, the power to authorize is a continuing power within the meaning of s. 31(3) of the  
 Interpretation Act 
 . I do not think that the authorization to issue the licence conferred upon the appellant an irrevocable legal right to a licence. Until the licence is issued, there is no licence and therefore no permission to do what is otherwise prohibited, namely fish for lobster in the offshore. Unless and until the licence is actually issued, the Minister in furtherance of government policy may reevaluate or reconsider his initial decision to authorize the licence. Until the Minister actually issued the licence, he possessed a continuing power to reconsider his earlier decision to authorize and or issue the licence:  
 Reference re Maritime Freight Rates Act 
 , [1933] S.C.R. 423." 
 
 
 
 The plaintiff was issued annual fishing licences. At the end of each calendar year, they expired. The Minister was not under an obligation, because a previous licence had been issued, to reissue the same licence the following year or permit the utilization of inshore and offshore licences at the same time because this had been permitted in a prior year.
