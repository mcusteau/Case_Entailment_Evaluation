  The plaintiff seems to argue that by reason of past practice, in 1992, 1993 and 1994, when he was not prohibited from utilizing both an inshore and offshore licence at the same time, his right to utilize both at the same time is now grandfathered. Jim Baird testified that during the period of the developmental program, the plaintiff was indeed permitted to utilize both inshore and offshore licences at the same time. However, this practice did not set any precedent or obligation on the Minister to permit utilization of both licences at the same time indefinitely into the future. Section 10 of the  
 Fisheries (General) Regulations 
  SOR/93-53, February 4, 1993, provides: 
 
 
 
 "10. Unless otherwise specified in a document, a document expires  
 
 
 
 (a) where it is issued for a calendar year, on December 31 of the year for which it is issued; or  
 
 
 
 (b) where it is issued for a fiscal year, on March 31 of the year for which it is issued." 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 "10. Sauf indication contraire dans le document, celui-ci expire à l'une des dates suivantes: 
 
 
 
 a) le 31 décembre de l'année pour laquelle il a été délivré, s'il est délivré pour une année civile; 
 
 
 
 b) le 31 mars de l'année pour laquelle il a été délivré, s'il est délivré pour un exercice." 
 
 
 
 There was no time specified in any licence issued to the plaintiff and all licences were issued for calendar years.
