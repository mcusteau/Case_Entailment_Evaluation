The respondent argues for his part that the applicant's PIF omitted several significant facts that were only introduced at the hearing. Among the omissions found by the RPD, the applicant's PIF did not state that the PSB had put him on a wanted list, or that he needed a smuggler to bribe the airport officials in order to leave the country; these allegations were only introduced at the applicant's oral hearing. Therefore and in view of these omissions, the RPD was entitled to conclude as a result that the applicant lacked of credibility. In support of this argument the respondent cites
Sanchez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration.),
[2000] F.C.J. No. 536, 98 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1265. The respondent adds that the RPD does not err in finding it implausible that the applicant would not know that the material sold in his store was about the Falun Gong after having watched the DVDs, and that he would have be able to exit China using his own passport if his name was on a wanted list by national authorities. The respondent argues that the Board is entitled to make such reasonable findings based on implausibility, common sense and rationality.
