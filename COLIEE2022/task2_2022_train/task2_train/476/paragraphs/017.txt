In brief the impugned "decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law", and therefore deserves defence from this Court. For these reasons this Court concludes that the RPD did not commit a reviewable error and therefore the judicial review will be dismissed.
