With respect to the degree of resemblance between the marks at issue in appearance, sound and ideas suggested by them, as set out in s. 6(5)(e) of the
Act
, the Registrar noted that both marks suggest the idea of the name of a person including the word HUGO which is a given name in the respondent's trademark HUGO BOSS and a Christian name in the appellant's trademark VICTOR HUGO & Design. The Registrar concluded that the appellant's trademark is dominated visually by the word HUGO. Also, the element BOSS in the respondent's trademark would be perceived visually by the average consumer as being the dominant element of the respondent's trademark given that the trademark HUGO BOSS is often used in conjunction with and subsidiary to the mark BOSS. As a result, the Registrar found there is at least some similarity in appearance between the trademarks at issue when considered as a matter of immediate impression and imperfect recollection. He further found that both marks have little resemblance when sounded.
