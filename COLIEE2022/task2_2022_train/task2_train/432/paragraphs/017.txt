In the case at bar, I find that the Registrar applied the correct test to determine whether there was any likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue based on the evidence which was before him. The Registrar correctly applied the likelihood of confusion test set out in s. 6(5) of the
Act
, considered all the surrounding circumstances including those specified in each paragraph of the latter provision, and properly did so from the point of view of the average consumer as a matter of an immediate impression and imperfect recollection. [See
Battle Pharmaceuticals v. British Drug Houses Ltd.
, [1944] Ex. C.R. 239, at 248-249.] The appellant has not shown any specific and relevant surrounding circumstances which would have been disregarded by the Registrar in determining whether the trademarks at issue were confusing. The appellant also failed to convince me that the Registrar based his decision on an erroneous finding of fact that he made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before him. On the contrary, I am of the opinion that the findings reached by the Registrar in connection with the surrounding circumstances he needed to consider are totally supported by the evidence which was before him.
