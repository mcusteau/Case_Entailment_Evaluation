[20]
As before the Registrar, the ground of opposition that the appellant was not the person entitled to registration pursuant to s. 16(3 of the
Act
must be decided by this court on the issue of confusion between the trademarks VICTOR HUGO & Design and HUGO BOSS. The material time therefore for considering the circumstances respecting this issue is as of the appellant's application filing date and the onus is on the appellant to establish that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue.
