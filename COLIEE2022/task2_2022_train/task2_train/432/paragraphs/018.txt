In that context, I am satisfied that the Registrar, on the basis of the evidence before him, could reasonably conclude that he was left in doubt as to whether there was a likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue. Consequently, the Registrar correctly concluded that, at the date of filing its application, the appellant had failed to meet the legal burden upon it of establishing that there existed no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue. Having thus upheld the respondent's ground of opposition that the appellant was not the person entitled to registration pursuant to s. 16(3) of the
Act
, it was unnecessary for the Registrar to consider the remaining grounds of opposition.
