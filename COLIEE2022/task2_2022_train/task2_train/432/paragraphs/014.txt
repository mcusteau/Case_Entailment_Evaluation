In the final analysis, the Registrar concluded that he was left in doubt as to "whether there might be a likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue". As a result, he concluded that the appellant had failed to meet the burden upon it of establishing that there would be no reasonable likelihood of confusion, and thus refused the appellant's application pursuant to s. 38(8) [see footnote 5] of the
Act
