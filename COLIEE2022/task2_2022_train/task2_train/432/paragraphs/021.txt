[21]
In the context of this particular ground of opposition, the only new admissible evidence relevant to assessing the likelihood of confusion between the trademarks at issue, given my conclusions above on the first issue, is evidence of surrounding circumstances which existed at the material date, namely the filing date of the appellant's application for registration of the mark VICTOR HUGO & Design. Accordingly, no evidence concerning the use of the trademark VICTOR HUGO & Design can be considered given the appellant did not commence using such mark until after filing its application for proposed use.
