With respect to the circumstances in ss. 6(5)(b), (c) and (d), the Registrar concluded that the length of time the trademarks had been in use in Canada clearly favours the respondent, who had used its mark in Canada since at least as early as 1975. The Registrar held that the wares of the parties are the same and the channels of trade associated with their wares would overlap. He noted that their wares have been sold through the same men's retail clothing stores in Canada.
