It is trite law, as the Board recognized, that in assessing a applicant's subjective fear of persecution, the Board can take into consideration the applicant's behaviour. The Federal Court of Appeal in Heer v. M.E.I. (13 April 1988) Doc. No. A-474-87 (F.C.A.) recognized that an applicant's delay in claiming refugee status "is an important factor which the Board is entitled to consider in weighing a claim for refugee status". As the Board states, delay points to a lack of subjective fear of persecution, the reasoning being that someone who was truly fearful would claim refugee status at the first opportunity.
