Indeed, despite the applicant's alleged fear of imprisonment, torture and death in Mexico, his background (legal training for four years) and his admission that he consulted a lawyer who advised him to make a refugee claim between a few months and 8 months of his arrival in Canada contradicts his assertion. The applicant's explanations included that he "was focused on earning money", that the peace and tranquillity in Canada "lulled his sense of danger", that he did "not in fact enter into a serious relationship with anyone until about 18 months after [he] had arrived in Canada and until then [he] did not really feel a strong desire to commit [himself] to staying permanently in Canada". This so-called justification is certainly not persuasive.
