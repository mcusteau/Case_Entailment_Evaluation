  In its decision, the Board stated that no documentary evidence was submitted demonstrating that the claimant would face persecution if he had to return to India as a failed refugee claimant. It went on to cite documentary evidence stating that only those Indian nationals who had not complied with Indian laws upon their departure would run the risk of being prosecuted upon return. Furthermore, the evidence showed that failed asylum seekers returning to India might be questioned briefly, but were usually then free to leave the airport (or other port of entry). The Board also quoted documentary evidence that stated that if the individual was being sought by any Indian security or police forces, he would be handed over to the force in question. Otherwise, the authorities would likely only be involved for a brief initial interview.
