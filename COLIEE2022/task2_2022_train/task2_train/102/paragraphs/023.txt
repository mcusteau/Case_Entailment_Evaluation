  Finally, the Applicant submits that the Board's conclusion that he will not suffer persecution upon his return, based upon documentary evidence stating that asylum seekers who both leave and return with proper travel documentation, ignored the fact that the Applicant actually left with improper documents and therefore is in violation of India's exit laws.

 , i.e. returning. As worthy as the applicant may be for Canadian immigrant status, the Refugee Board, and this Court, do not have the legal jurisdiction to grant defectors legal status. [My emphasis]
