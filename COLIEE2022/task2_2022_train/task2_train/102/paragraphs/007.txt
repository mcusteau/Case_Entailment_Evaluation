  Mr. Singh left the Punjab region and arrived in Rajasthan on May 10, 2003, to stay at a relative's house. The police continued to look for him in the Punjab, and beat his younger brother on October 1, 2003 in an attempt to ascertain the Applicant's whereabouts. His relative's home was subsequently ransacked, but the Applicant was not there at the time. He was, however, as a consequence, no longer welcome to live there. At this point, Mr. Singh made arrangements with a smuggling agent to come to Canada.
