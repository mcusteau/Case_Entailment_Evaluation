  Section 97 of IRPA extends protection to those who, while not refugees, are otherwise in need of protection which they are unable to obtain from the authorities in their country of origin. The Applicant here claims to be in need of such protection since, as a failed Sikh refugee claimant being returned to India from Canada, the Indian authorities will suspect him of having ties to militants abroad. The Applicant claims that there is widespread belief that there is a significant Sikh element in Canada which can be considered terrorist, and, as such, he will run a serious risk of detention, torture and/or persecution.
