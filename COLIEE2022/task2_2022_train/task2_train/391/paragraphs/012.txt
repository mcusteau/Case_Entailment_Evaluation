[12]
From my review of the material submitted to the Court the following have been proved:
a. The Plaintiffs are the registered owners of the Moroccanoil trade-marks including the Moroccanoil Get-up, used in association with hair care products;
b. The Defendant, Mr Svitilli, purchased from American Industries LLC and sold, in at least two transactions, 100ml bottles of Moroccanoil Oil Treatment which bears a reproduction on its packaging and labeling of one or more of the Moroccanoil Trade-marks and uses the Moroccanoil Get-up, without the authority, license or permission of the Plaintiff;
c. That the 100ml bottles of Moroccanoil Oil Treatment offered for sale and sold by the Defendant, Mr Sivitilli, are not authentic Moroccanoil Oil Treatment because they contain oil that is a different composition and is not consistent with the authentic product;
d. That the Defendant, Mr Sivitilli, admitted that he benefited from the sale of the counterfeit products and received $33,184 for the first transaction and $8,316 on the second transaction for a total of $41,500.
