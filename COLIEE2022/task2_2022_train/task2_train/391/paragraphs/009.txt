Mr Sivitilli claims that he never had control of the product and that his role was to source the product, negotiate its price and have it sent directly to the distributor. Mr Sivitilli received payment from the LND group through a now cancelled corporation, North One Investments, that had been his father's company. Mr Sivitilli described the invoices sent to LND and the amounts paid by them to him through North One as a finder's fee or commission. Regardless of how these amounts are characterised, Mr Sivittilli was remunerated for sourcing the product, arranging for it to be sent to LND and directing that payment be made to Daca Global Trading as requested by American Industries LLC. I note that Mr Sivitilli indicated that he had no information about the role of Daca Global Trading.
