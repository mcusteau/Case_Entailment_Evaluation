I am further satisfied that the Plaintiff has established that the Defendant received the following amounts, which included amounts for GST/HST which, as admitted by the Defendant, was not remitted but was retained by the Defendant. Because the amounts attributed to the GST/ HST have not been paid, they must be included in the profits of the Defendant.
