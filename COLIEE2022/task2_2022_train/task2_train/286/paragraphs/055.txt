[55]
The OSLRDS report said the applicant
assaulted
another inmate. He denies it. The applicant was charged and found not guilty. It matters little the prison guard witnesses did not show up. In the circumstances, it is not accurate to assert, as a fact, he assaulted the other inmate particularly when regard is had to the reports of the prison guards who witnessed the incident. At best, as the matter stands today, he was suspected of assaulting another inmate. The Citizens' Advisory Committee recommended that this assault information be removed from his file.
