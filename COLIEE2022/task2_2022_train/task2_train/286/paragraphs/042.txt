[42]
The
precise decision
which section 24 gives rise to is the decision by the Service whether or not to rectify the record of an offender who believes the information about him/her is inaccurate. Such a decision, limited to primary facts, does not involve considerable choices by the CSC and turns on the application of proper legal principles and involves the rights and interests of an offender.
