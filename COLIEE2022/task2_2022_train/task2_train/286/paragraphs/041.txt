The signal given by Parliament in section 24, in the form of a statutory duty imposed on the Service, is that the "information banks" reflected in various reports maintained about offenders should contain the best information possible: exact, correct information without relevant omissions and data not burdened by past stereotyping or archaisms related to the offender. In Parliament's view, the quality of the information prescribed by section 24 leads to better decisions about an offender's incarceration and, in this manner, leads to the achievement of the purposes of the
Act
. Section 24 of the
Act
, however, is not concerned with the inferences or assessments drawn by the Service from file information. Section 24 cannot be used to second guess decisions by the CSC provided the information base on which those conclusions are drawn comply with this provision. Section 24 deals with primary facts; this point will be expanded on later.
