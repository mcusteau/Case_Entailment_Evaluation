Properly construed, these words enable the CSC to correct or refuse to correct the information - because there is this choice, the CSC exercises a discretion when making the decision to correct or not. (See
Baker v. Canada, (M.C.I.)
, supra, at paragraph 52.) If so, such a discretion is reviewable on proper principles governing the review of discretionary decisions such as bad faith, improper purpose, irrelevant consideration and error of law. (See
Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Canada and Canada (Minister of Economic Development)
, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2; 44 N.R. 354, at pp. 7-8.)
