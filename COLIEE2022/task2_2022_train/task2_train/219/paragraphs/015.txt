  The purposes of an H&C application and a PRRA application are different. An H&C application seeks to determine whether there are humanitarian and compassionate grounds for allowing an applicant to apply for permanent residence without having to obtain a permanent resident visa outside Canada. On the other hand, a PRRA application allows an applicant to present any new evidence concerning the risks of returning to the country of origin that has arisen between the time of the decision rejecting the claim for refugee protection and the time of deportation from Canada. The two applications therefore have completely different requirements.
