  The assessment of a decision's "reasonableness" is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. The Court must also ensure that the decision falls within "a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , above, at paragraph 47).
