Proper interpretation of s. 20(1)(c)(i) of the Act, therefore, requires that a taxpayer, before he or she can deduct interest expenses:
(a) trace the borrowed funds to an identifiable use which triggers the deduction; and
(b) generally demonstrate that the borrowed funds were used directly and immediately to earn income from a business or property;
the purpose of the provision being to "encourage the accumulation of capital which would produce taxable income".
