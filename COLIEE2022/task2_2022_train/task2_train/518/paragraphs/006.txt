This legislative provision was the subject of consideration by the Supreme Court of Canada, in Phyllis Barbara Bronfman Trust v. Minister of National Revenue (1987), 71 N.R. 134; 87 D.T.C. 5059 (S.C.C.), where Chief Justice Dickson (as he then was) assessed the purpose of the provision as follows, at page 5064:
"It is perhaps otiose to note at the outset that in the absence of a provision such as s. 20(1)(c) specifically authorizing the deduction from income of interest payments in certain circumstances, no such deductions could generally be taken by the taxpayer. ...
"I agree with Marceau, J., as to the purpose of the interest deduction provision. Parliament created s. 20(1)(c)(i), and made it operate notwithstanding s. 18(1)(b), in order to encourage the accumulation of capital which would produce taxable income. ...
"The statutory deduction thus requires a characterization of the use of borrowed money as between the eligible use of earning nonexempt income from a business or property and a variety of possible ineligible uses. The onus is on the taxpayer to trace the borrowed funds to an identifiable use which triggers the deduction. ...
"The interest deduction provision requires not only a characterization of the use of borrowed funds, but also a characterization of 'purpose'. Eligibility for the deduction is contingent on the use of borrowed money for the purpose of earning income. It is well-established in the jurisprudence, however, that it is not the purpose of the borrowing itself which is relevant. What is relevant, rather, is the taxpayer's purpose in using the borrowed money in a particular manner: Auld v. M.N.R., 62 D.T.C. 27 (T.A.B.). Consequently, the focus of the inquiry must be centered on the use to which the taxpayer put the borrowed funds."
