If the applicant had received notice of the requirement of the conviction confirmation and had forwarded that form to the respondent two to three weeks earlier than what occurred, I am convinced that he would have been granted his status. The respondent has demonstrated the enormous workload faced by the Department, however, that cannot be used in this case as an excuse for their delay in processing a valid claim, which claim would have been accepted but for the delay and the change in the legislation. In this case, the change in the legislation cannot be used to operate to the detriment of the applicant.
