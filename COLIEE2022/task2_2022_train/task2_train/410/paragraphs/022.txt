Thus, it appears that s. 109 dictates that if Mr. Kanes' application was still pending on February 1, 1993, then the amended s. 19(2)(a) would apply and his summary conviction would prevent him from receiving permanent residence in Canada. In my opinion, this provision expressly overrides any Common Law presumption against the retrospective application of a change in legislation. Parliament has clearly dictated how the transition is to be dealt with in respect of a pending application under the
Act
. I do not agree with counsel for the applicant that s. 109 merely refers to procedural matters, and therefore, I do believe that it applies to the applicant's request for landing. However, the case of
McDoom
, supra, still requires comment.
