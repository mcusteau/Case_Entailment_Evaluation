The applicant was contacted by Immigration officials in the second week of January, 1993, and told that he was required to provide Immigration with documentation confirming that the conviction in question was for a summary conviction offence. On January 18, 1993, the applicant went to the Court office and applied for the necessary documents. The applicant picked up these documents on January 26, 1993, and states he delivered them to Immigration Canada on January 27, 1993. Pursuant to departmental policy, the applicant was not provided with a receipt for these documents when he delivered them. A representative of the respondent, Ms. Lalita Jeethan, stated in an affidavit and under oath during cross-examination on that affidavit, that the date stamps on the envelope containing the documents in question indicated February 2, 1993 as the date of delivery. As of January 27, 1993, the applicant had completed all other steps necessary for the processing of his application.
