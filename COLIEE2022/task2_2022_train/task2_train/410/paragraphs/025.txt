Section 1992)(a) of the
Act
was specifically amended to include hybrid offences which proceed by way of summary conviction as a grounds for denying landing. Given this amendment, it is unreasonable to read the previous subsection as including this type of summary conviction, because to do so would render the amendment meaningless. Thus, the legislation prior to February 1, 1993, did not include the offence for which Mr. Kanes was convicted as a bar to landing. However, that conclusion only answers a part of the question. It still remains to determine if the last step was merely a formality as the applicant asserts or if the process was still pending at the critical date.
