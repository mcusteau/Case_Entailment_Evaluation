Act
are clear. He relies on s. 109 of the provisions to argue that a pending application or process, as of February 1, 1993, must be processed in accordance with the new provisions of the

Act
must apply and the applicant was properly found to be criminally inadmissible by virtue of the amended s. 19(2)(a) of the
Act
.
