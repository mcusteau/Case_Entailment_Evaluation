At the conclusion of the hearing, counsel presented their submissions with respect to the certification of a question of general important under s. 83 of the amended
Act
. The question, submitted to the Court reads:
"Does s. 109 of the Transitional Provisions of Bill C-86 operate to extinguish the rights that the applicant to be processed under the
Immigration
Act
as it stood prior to the enactment Bill C-86?"
Having regard to the particular factual circumstances of this case, including the six year delay in processing the applicant's claim, I do not see any question that warrants certification.
Order accordingly.
