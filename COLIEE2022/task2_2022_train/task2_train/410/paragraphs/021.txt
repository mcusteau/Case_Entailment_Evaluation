Looking now to the question of which provision to apply, s. 109 of Bill C-86 (as enacted, S.C. 1992, c. 49) reads as follows:
"109. Subject to ss. 110 to 120, every provision of the Immigration Act as enacted by this Act shall, on the coming into force of that provision, apply in respect of every application, proceeding or matter under that Act or the regulations made thereunder that is pending or in progress immediately before the coming into force of that provision."
