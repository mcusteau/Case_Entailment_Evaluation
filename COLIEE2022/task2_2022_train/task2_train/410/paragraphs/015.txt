The applicant relies on an analogy to the case of
Re Kleifges
, [1978] 1 F.C. 734 (F.C.T.D.), in which the Court held that a change in the
Citizenship Act
could not operate to deny the applicant of a right to a period of residence which he had accrued under the old
Act
. The applicant in this case submits that Mr. Kleifges had undertaken substantial steps towards his claim, although he had not actually filed an application, and that these steps were recognized by the Court, as his steps should be here.
