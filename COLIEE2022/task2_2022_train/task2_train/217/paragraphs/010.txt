  On September 6, 2010, prior to receiving a decision in relation to his second level grievance, Mr. Wilson submitted a formal request for the correction of his institutional files to the Privacy Division of the CSC. By letter dated September 17, 2010 Mr. Wilson was advised that the Privacy Division did not have jurisdiction over the correction of his files, and that his request was being forwarded to Mr. Wilson's parole officer for follow-up. Unfortunately, the parole officer did not receive the request at that time.
