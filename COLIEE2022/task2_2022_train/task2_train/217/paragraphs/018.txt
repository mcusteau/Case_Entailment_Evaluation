  While the delays associated with the processing of Mr. Wilson's grievance are regrettable, Mr. Wilson has not persuaded me that there was any procedural unfairness in the way that the CSC dealt with Grievance #21120. He had a full opportunity to access the grievance process, and his submissions were considered and addressed at each stage of the process. Whether the decision at the third level was reasonable is a separate issue, which will be addressed next.
