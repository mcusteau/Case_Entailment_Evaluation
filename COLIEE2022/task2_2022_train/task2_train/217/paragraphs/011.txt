  After a delay in processing, an Assistant Deputy Commissioner denied Mr. Wilson's grievance at the second level on November 25, 2010. The Assistant Deputy Commissioner found that the allegations in Mr. Wilson's earlier complaints did not constitute allegations of harassment or discrimination. The Assistant Deputy Commissioner further concluded that the appropriate route to address errors in Mr. Wilson's file was for Mr. Wilson to file a Request for Correction with his parole officer. Alternatively, Mr. Wilson could request a reconsideration of the community assessment through his Case Management Team.
