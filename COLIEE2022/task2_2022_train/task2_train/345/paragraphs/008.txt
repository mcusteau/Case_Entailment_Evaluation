It is important to emphasize that in its reasons for decision the Refugee Division stated that the claimants were credible, and held that they had a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico City. However, as I have already indicated, the Refugee Division rejected their claims to be recognized in Canada as refugees because they had an alternative flight alternative, and thus fell outside the definition of a Convention Refugee. Applying the two-pronged test established in
Rasaratnam v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 1 F.C. 706; 140 N.R. 138 (F.C.A.), for determining whether an alternative flight alternative exists, the Refugee Division found that on the balance of probabilities there was no serious possibility that the applicants would be persecuted outside Mexico City, and that it was not otherwise unreasonable for them to live elsewhere in Mexico.
