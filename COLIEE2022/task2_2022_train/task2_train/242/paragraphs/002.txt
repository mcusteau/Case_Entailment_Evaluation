In particular, I held the defendant Musadiq Pardhan in contempt of court as charged in para. 2 of the show cause order issued on July 29, 1997, by Jerome, A.C.J., which stated:
"2.

that the defendants MUSADIQ PARDHAN and MUSTAFA PARDHAN shall appear before this court ... to answer if they can, why they should not be held in contempt of court for:
(a) breaching the Interlocutory Injunction Order rendered January 8, 1996 by The Honourable Justice MacKay ('the Or­der'), in that, in direct and blatant con­travention of the express terms of the Order, they have, directly or indirectly through 1184268 Ontario Limited:
