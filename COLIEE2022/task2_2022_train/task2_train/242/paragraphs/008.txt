A review of the principal findings of fact made concerning Musadiq Pardhan, on the evidence adduced during the contempt of court hearing, is useful in an assessment of the plaintiffs' submissions concerning the appropriate fine:
"73. ... I find beyond a reasonable doubt that 39 shipments, which included Coca-Cola products, were exported from Canada by 1184268 Ontario Limited, carrying on business under the style of Sid Enterprise, contrary to the terms of the injunction.
. . . . .
"109. ... Mr. Chen, acting for Bay Harbour Trading, purchased at least six shipments of canned beverages from Sid Enterprise in April and May 1997, each of which included Coca-Cola products. It is not plausible that, when writing this letter to his father, Musadiq did not know that Mr. Chen, with whom he was photographed, was receiving Coca-Cola products in the containers referred to in this correspondence and in 'Sid's' letter of May 12, 1997. [Footnote omitted.]
. . . . .
"132. Accordingly, I find beyond a reasonable doubt that 'Sid's' letter of May 12, 1997 was written by Musadiq Pardhan and that he participated in the sales of Coca-Cola products to Bay Harbour Trading Corporation in April and May 1997 for 1184268 Ontario Limited, carrying on business as Sid Enterprise.
"133. ... These important facts, when understood with the other evidence, lead me to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Musadiq Pardhan was directly involved in the exportation of Coca-Cola products contrary to the injunction of January 8, 1996."
