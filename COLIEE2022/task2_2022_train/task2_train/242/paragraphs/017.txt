Fourth, in their written submissions, the plaintiffs urged that:
"From a policy perspective, it makes no sense to treat a series of separate acts which violate an Order as if there was only one act of contempt. A single Order may be breached many times, each of which may support a finding of contempt and an appropriate penalty. If only one finding of contempt and one penalty can result from multiple breaches of an Order, then contemnors will be encouraged to flout the process of the court repeatedly."
This policy submission, which is not without merit, may find its response in rule 472(
c
) of the new
Federal Court Rules, 1998
, which places no limitation on the quantum of the fine that can be imposed. The strength of the policy submission cannot be used to the detriment of the defendants where the former
Rules
specifically provided for a maximum monetary penalty of $5,000 and where the show cause order was issued in such general terms.
