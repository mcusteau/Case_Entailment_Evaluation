[29]
Concerning the disbursements sought by the plaintiffs, I have considered the relevant importance of the investigators' work and affidavit evidence which led to the second Anton Piller order which was issued on July 29, 1997. It is my understanding that information obtained from a third party in March 1997, led to the plaintiffs' decision to involve the investigators at that time. The investigators identified the involvement of the defendants Musadiq Pardhan and Mustafa Pardhan in Sid Enterprise at its Steeles Avenue premises. Their surveillance also identified the role of Oscar Cheddi. However, the plaintiffs' success in establishing the guilt of the defendant Musadiq Pardhan was more directly related, and substantially so in my view, to the Cheddi documents and the ability to correlate this material with the information obtained under subpoena from the Price Club records. The Cheddi documents were obtained from the execution of the second Anton Piller order. This same order also resulted in the plaintiffs' obtention of useful documents from the Pardhan residence and from the Steeles Avenue premises of Sid Enterprise. The documents obtained from the second Anton Piller order were more relevant to the plaintiffs' success, in an evidentiary sense, than the extensive hours spent by the investigators in surveillance. Finally, I have concluded that it would be inappropriate to award any disbursements or fees with respect to the testimony of the solicitor.
