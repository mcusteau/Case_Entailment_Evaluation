The question of the date from which interest should be calculated was addressed by Gibson, J., in
CCH Canadian Ltd. et al. v. Law Society of Upper Canada
(2004), 266 F.T.R. 159; 2004 FC 1760, and in reasons issued by the Federal Court of Appeal in a parallel motion that are attached as a schedule to Justice Gibson's decision, see:
CCH Canadian Ltd. v. Law Society of Upper Canada
(2004), 243 D.L.R.(4th) 759; 2004 FCA 278. I conclude from those reasons that interest on costs should normally flow from the date of the trial judgment in which costs are awarded a party unless an assessment is ordered, in which case they should be calculated from the date of that order. CFM did not dispute that post-judgment interest was payable but submitted that it should be simple and not compounded. I am satisfied that this award shall bear interest from the date of the trial judgment, May 11, 2006 at five percent (5%) not compounded as provided for by s. 127 of the
Courts of Justice Act
.
