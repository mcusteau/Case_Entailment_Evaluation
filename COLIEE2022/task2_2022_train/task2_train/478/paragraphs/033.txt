By CFM's calculations, the total amount of fees that should be awarded under Column III would be no more than $100,000. CFM also contends that the plaintiff's disbursements, notwithstanding the reduction in the amended proposal, continue to be excessive and should be limited to $150,000. It further argues that the total lump sum amount should be reduced by a factor of at least 25% as Dimplex was not successful in its allegation that punitive, aggravated or exemplary damages should be awarded. As a result, CFM submits that Dimplex's costs be fixed between $150,000 and $200,000 in total for both fees and disbursements.
