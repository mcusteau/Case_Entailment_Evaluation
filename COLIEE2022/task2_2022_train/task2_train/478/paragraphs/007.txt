Rule 400(1) of the
Federal Court Rules
grants a broad discretion to the Court in relation to costs:
Capital Vision Inc. et al. v. Minister of National Revenue
(2003), 241 F.T.R. 121; 2003 FC 1253, at para. 16 (
Capital Vision
). That being said, costs should neither be punitive nor extravagant:
Aird et al. v. Country Park Village Property (Mainland) Ltd.
(2004), 257 F.T.R. 1; 2004 FC 945, at para. 6 (
Aird
). The Supreme Court of Canada has also made it clear that awarding costs on a solicitor-client basis remains exceptional; it is an award that is generally associated with reprehensible, scandalous or outrageous conduct on the part of one of the parties:
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; 243 N.R. 22, at para. 77;
Rice, P.C.J. v. New Brunswick
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 405; 282 N.R. 201; 245 N.B.R.(2d) 299; 636 A.P.R. 299; 2002 SCC 13, at para. 86.
