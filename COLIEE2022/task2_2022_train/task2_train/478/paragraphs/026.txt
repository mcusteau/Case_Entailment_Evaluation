[26]
Litigation misconduct is a factor more properly considered in relation to items (i), (j) and/or (k) under Rule 400(3). Plaintiff's counsel acknowledged during closing argument at trial that there had been no significant misconduct in the present proceedings. That acknowledgement, which the defendant argues should weigh heavily against the plaintiff now, was made in the context of a question from the Court respecting the claim for aggravated, exemplary or punitive damages.
