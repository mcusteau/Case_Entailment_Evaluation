[28]
It is not enough to say that because the plaintiff lost its claim for punitive damages, willful infringement is not an issue to be considered in the assessment of costs. The plaintiff is not trying to re-litigate its punitive damages claim as asserted by the defendant. Instead, the plaintiff reasonably contends that the Court should consider under the scope of the discretion granted to it pursuant to Rule 400(3)(o), that the defendant did not innocently breach Dimplex's rights, but did so knowingly. I was satisfied from the evidence that this was established. CFM was unable to come up with a competitive alternative and chose to copy a proven success. This factor can and will be taken into account by the Court in the context of assessing costs in the present case.
