The plaintiff argues that the Court ought to ensure that costs awarded bear some reasonable semblance to the actual costs of litigation, which are reflected in the amount of work done. The plaintiff highlights the reasoning of the Court in
Apotex Inc. v. Syntex Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. et al.
(1999), 176 F.T.R. 142; 2 C.P.R.(4th) 368 (T.D.), at para. 9, wherein the Court found that "[t]his case, while not the most complex of patent cases, did exceed the average complexity of an average case" and therefore an "increase in Column III level costs" was justified.
