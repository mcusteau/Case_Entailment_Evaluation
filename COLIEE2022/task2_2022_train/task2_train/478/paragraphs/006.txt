Based on the submissions of the parties, I consider that I need to address the following issues before arriving at a determination of a lump sum award:
1. What is the general scope of the Court's discretion to award increased costs within or outside of Tariff B?
2. What is the effect of the Dimplex settlement offers with respect to Rule 420?
3. What are the appropriate factors to consider in the present case under Rule 400(3)?
