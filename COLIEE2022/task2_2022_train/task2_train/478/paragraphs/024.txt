This is not a case where the volume of work done by the plaintiff was due to the nature of the invention:
Monsanto Canada Inc. et al. v. Schmeiser et al.
(2002), 220 F.T.R. 60; 19 C.P.R.(4th) 524; 2002 FCT 439, at para. 17, affd. [2002] N.R. Uned. 261; 22 C.P.R.(4th) 455; 2002 FCA 449. The requirement to prove ingenuity may have added some time to the trial as the physical exhibits, electric fireplaces, had to be dismantled to demonstrate their inner workings but that was not a significant factor in my view.
