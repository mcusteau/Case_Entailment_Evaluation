As for the fact that it may appear to be illogical to allow the decision to stand when the criminal conviction has been set aside, in
Smith v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] 3 F.C. 144 (T.D.), my colleague, Mr. Justice MacKay, considered the situation where Mr. Smith had been found to be inadmissible because two criminal convictions and a deportation order issued. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Smith was granted a pardon. Justice MacKay found that, since the deportation order was issued before the pardon, the adjudicator did not err by issuing the deportation order. The pardon was to be given prospective, not retrospective, effect.
