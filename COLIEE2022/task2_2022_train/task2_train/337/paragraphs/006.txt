On November 6, 2002, Mr. Johnson filed an updated humanitarian and compassionate form in which he declared, among other things, that:
• He had not been charged with a crime or offence in Canada.
• He understood that the government would contact police authorities in order to obtain records that would be used in evaluating whether he was admissible to Canada.
• He would report to a Canada Immigration Centre (CIC) if the answer to any question he had answered on his updated humanitarian and compassionate form changed.
