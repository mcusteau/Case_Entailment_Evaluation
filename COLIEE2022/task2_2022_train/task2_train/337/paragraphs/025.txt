Moreover, while an officer cannot exercise bad faith in deciding when to make a decision about inadmissibility, there must be some discretion in an officer as to when a decision may be rendered. Otherwise, long periods of time could go by awaiting the outcome of appeals or pending criminal charges. As Mr. Johnson's circumstances show, the state of a criminal record is not always static.
