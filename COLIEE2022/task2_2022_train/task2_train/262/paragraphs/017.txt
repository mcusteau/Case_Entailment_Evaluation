The applicant's assertion is not supported by the record. A review of the transcript of the cross-examination of the visa officer reveals that, while she was not able to remember precisely the details of the interview, she remembered clearly that most of the interview had been concerned with questioning the applicant about his occupational experience and what he did when he worked for Belomorski-Onezhskoe Parokhodstvo. This assertion is supported by the content of her CAIPs notes.
