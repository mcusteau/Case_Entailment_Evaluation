[10]
The visa officer concluded that the applicant did not have the employment experience to qualify as either a mechanical engineer or a marine engineer. She found that he had the employment experience to work as a marine engineer officer (NOC 2274), but there was no occupational demand for this occupation. The applicant also qualified as an industrial mechanic (marine) (NOC 7311) for which there was an occupational demand factor of 10. The applicant nevertheless only scored 65 points and was thus not admissible to Canada. No argument with respect to this last assessment was made to me and it did not play a role in the applicant's critique of the visa officer's decision.
