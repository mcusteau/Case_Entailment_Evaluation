The above passages from the cross-examination are only some of those that refer to the visa officer's questioning of the applicant about the work he did for Belomorski-Onezhskoe Parokhodstvo. As noted, her evidence is supported by the CAIPs notes. It is simply untenable to suggest that she did not give the applicant an opportunity to respond to her concerns about his lack of experience.
