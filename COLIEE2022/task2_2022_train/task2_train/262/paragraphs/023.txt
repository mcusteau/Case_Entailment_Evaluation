Also, as noted above, the CCPE assessment is of limited value since it expressly states that that assessment is not an indication that the applicant can work as an engineer in Canada. The employer's letter of reference also does not buttress the applicant's claim to be a mechanical or marine engineer. It describes him as an "Engineer-Ship Mechanic of the 3rd category" who, after having gained knowledge and experience on the job, successfully passed exams and received a diploma and the qualifications of an "Engineer-Ship Mechanic of the 2nd category". As noted above, the visa officer repeatedly noted in cross-examination that while she may not have made a specific reference to the employer's letter, the bulk of her interview of the applicant consisted of asking questions of the applicant about the duties he performed for that employer. It simply cannot be seriously argued that the visa officer ignored the employer's reference letter set out in paragraph 3, supra.
