The applicant has a diploma from Leningrad College of Marine Engineering (now the State Marine Academy named after Admiral Makarov). His diploma is entitled Engineer Ship-Mechanic. He completed a study plan in specialty 1403: Maintenance of Ship Power Stations. The visa officer accepted the applicant's education as qualifying him to be an engineer but concluded he had never pursued that profession. The Canadian Council for Professional Engineers provided an informal positive assessment of the applicant's qualifications "for immigration purposes". This assessment was not a determination that the applicant was entitled to work as an engineer in Canada.
