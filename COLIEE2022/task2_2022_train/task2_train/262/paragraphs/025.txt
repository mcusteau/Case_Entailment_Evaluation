I am not convinced that the consultation of the
Oxford Dictionary
was the use of extrinsic evidence. The applicant and the visa officer had differing views over whether a mechanical engineer would be described by the Russian word "inginier" rather than "mekhanik". This concern was put to the applicant at the interview; he was given an opportunity to respond to it. The visa officer, after the interview, consulted what she considered to be an authoritative dictionary that confirmed her view, a dictionary that is easily publically available. This does not appear to me to be much different from what judges routinely do in consulting authorities after the hearing of a case and, unless those authorities raise an entirely new point that was not discussed at the hearing, do not call those authorities to counsel's attention.
