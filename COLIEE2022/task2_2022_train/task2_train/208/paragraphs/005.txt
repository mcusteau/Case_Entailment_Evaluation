  The protective order arises in the context of a patent dispute. It began with Apotex serving Merck with a notice of allegation pursuant to the  
 Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations 
  stating that it had filed a submission with the Minister of Health for oral tablets for the treatment and prevention of Osteoporosis and treatment of Paget's Disease. It alleged that Merck's Canadian patents would not be infringed by Apotex's fabrication and sale of the tablets. It further alleged that Merck's patent is invalid. Merck responded by filing a notice of application in this Court requesting the Minister not to issue a notice of compliance until after expiration of the patent in question and for an order declaring that Apotex's notice of allegation is invalid.
