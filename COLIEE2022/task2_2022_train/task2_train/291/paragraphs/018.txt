It is established on the plaintiffs' evidence that between January 12 and January 24 the defendant shipped no atenolol in order to mark compliance with the court's order. Mr. Johnston (by letter, Ex. J to the Sim affidavit) averred that atenolol shipped since January 24, 1989, was from Canadian, not imported, sources. Even if this evidence be viewed by "a mind willing to understand" as the plaintiffs' counsel put the matter, it does not amount to a prima facie case. A suspicious mind might possibly accede to the plaintiffs' allegations, but suspicion is not evidence, prima facie or otherwise.
