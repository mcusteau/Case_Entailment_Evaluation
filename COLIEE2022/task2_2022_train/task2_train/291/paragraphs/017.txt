In making her comparison of lot numbers, Ms. Sim did not assert the innocuousness, if such it be, of the codes which appear on the invoice. Such silence in regard to those patently obvious exhibited indicia detracts from the prima facie case which the plaintiffs seek to levy against the defendant for their significance is not stated. Nor is such a would-be case supported by the lot numbers. Assuming that they represent imported atenolol, it is apparent from the invoice date that the atenolol was not shipped after the defendant's officers and employees (if employee Mr. Phaneuf truly be) could be apprised of the terms of the injunction which was ordered by Mr. Justice Rouleau on that very date. What is important is that the very next day after the injunction issued, Mr. Weingarten although apparently unclear about the terms of the injunction, offered to take back the already shipped (but perhaps at that moment not yet received) atenolol.
