The applicant submits the following two grounds to expunge the ACROSS THE BOARD trademark from the register of trademarks:
a. Under paragraph 18(1)(a) of the

, the ACROSS THE BOARD trademark was invalid because it was not registrable because it was clearly descriptive of the character or quality of the wares or services; and
b. Under paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Act
, the ACROSS THE BOARD trademark was invalid because the respondent was not entitled to secure the registration because it was confusing with a trademark of the same name previously used by the applicant.
