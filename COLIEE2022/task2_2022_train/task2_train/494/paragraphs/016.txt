Section 6 of the
Act
defines how a trademark can be confusing with another trademark:
"
When a trademark or name is confusing
6(1) For the purposes of this Act, a trademark or trade-name is confusing with another trademark or trade-name if the use of the first mentioned trademark or trade-name would cause confusion with the last mentioned trademark or trade-name in the manner and circumstances described in this section.
"
Idem
(2) The use of a trademark causes confusion with another trademark if the use of both trademarks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with those trademarks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not the wares or services are of the same general class.
. . . . .
"
What to be considered
(5) In determining whether trademarks or trade-names are confusing, the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or trade-names and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trademarks or trade-names have been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or trade-names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them."
