The applicant has not discharged its burden. In this Court's opinion, the ACROSS THE BOARD trademark does not describe the material composition, or an intrinsic quality of the software. This function permits insurance agents to evaluate financial information for multiple life insurance policies. A trademark which is merely suggestive of the character scope or quality of the wares, does not offend paragraph 12(1)(b) of the
Act

Issue 2(b): Under paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Act
, the ACROSS THE BOARD trademark was invalid because the respondent was not entitled to secure the registration, because it was confusing with a trademark of the same name previously used by the applicant
