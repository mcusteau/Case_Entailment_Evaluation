The COMPULIFE Quotation software and the COMPUOFFICE office management software are different in nature, and are marketed differently. The COMPULIFE Quotation product is more of a service, and an ongoing relationship exists between the applicant and its customers. The COMPUOFFICE product is a ware, a software program, which when installed successfully, does not require an ongoing relationship between the respondent and its customers. Again, the purchasers of these products are insurance agents and companies, who understand the difference between the products. There is really no likelihood of confusion as to their source.
