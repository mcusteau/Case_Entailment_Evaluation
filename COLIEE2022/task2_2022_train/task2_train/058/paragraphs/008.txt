  The IAD indicated that while the applicant had submitted a letter from his wife dated February 26, 2006, indicating that she had terminal cancer and that if the applicant were to lose his permanent resident status his children would be orphaned upon her death, she subsequently submitted a second letter on March 3, 2006 stating that she had provided the first letter under duress. The IAD found the wife's second letter to be more credible. In the second letter, the applicant's wife indicated that it was her parents who took care of her and her children, and that the applicant had never done so.
