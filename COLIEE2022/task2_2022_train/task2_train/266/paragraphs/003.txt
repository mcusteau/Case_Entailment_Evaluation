In respect of sections 98 and Article 1 F(a) the Minister bears the burden of proof in establishing that the Applicant falls within these provisions, however, that burden is "less than the balance of probabilities" (Ramirez v. Canada (MCI), [1992] 2 F.C. 306 (FCA) at para. 10). This approach, however, must be tempered by the reasoning the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (MCI) v. Mugesera 2005 S.C.C. 39 in dealing with the words "reasonable grounds to believe" as found in section 19 (1) (j) of the previous Immigration Act, which words are not substantially different from "serious reasons for considering" found in F(a) supra. At paragraph 116 the Supreme Court said:
When applying the "reasonable grounds to believe" standard, it is important to distinguish between proof of questions of fact and the determination of questions of law. The "reasonable grounds to believe" standard of proof applies only to questions of fact: Moreno v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 F.C. 298 (C.A.), at p. 311. This means that in this appeal the standard applies to whether Mr. Mugesera gave the speech, to the message it conveyed in a factual sense and to the context in which it was delivered. On the other hand, whether these facts meet the requirements of a crime against humanity is a question of law. Determinations of questions of law are not subject to the "reasonable grounds to believe" standard, since the legal criteria for a crime against humanity will not be made out where there are merely reasonable grounds to believe that the speech
could
be classified as a crime against humanity. The facts as found on the "reasonable grounds to believe" standard must show that the speech
did
constitute a crime against humanity in law.
