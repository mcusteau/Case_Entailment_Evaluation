The question for the Court therefore is whether the findings of the Board in fact to support the conclusions in law were "patently unreasonable" given that the standard to be met by the Minister is "less than the balance of probabilities". In this regard the cases enumerate various considerations for "complicity" in situations such as the one now before the Court. I accept the summary of these considerations offered by the Minister's counsel at paragraph 32 of the Respondent's Further Factum:
a. The nature of the organization
b. The method of recruitment
c. The position/rank in the organization
d. The length of time in the organization
e. The opportunity to leave; and
f. The knowledge of the organization's atrocities.
