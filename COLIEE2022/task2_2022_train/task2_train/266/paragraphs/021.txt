Here, the Board did not find that the Special Forces #1 unit itself "committed" the acts only that it "aided" the Mobile Brigade. The nature of that "aid" is said to be "in the conduct of their work". The Board does not say "in the conduct of their (the Mobile Brigade's) atrocities". The evidence of "support" appears to be that of tactical military support in the conduct of a military operation (see Tribunal Record pages 1246-1297) there is no evidence of support in atrocities. Similarly, the atrocities, if any, of the Palace Brigade were committed before Sanchez joined that Brigade. The former officer of the Brigade was reprimanded and the new officer spoke of a new and honourable beginning for the Brigade.
