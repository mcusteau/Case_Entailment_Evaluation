The standard of review applicable to this issue is correctness. In
Chen v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2006 FC 85, 145 A.C.W.S. (3d) 770, Justice Phelan explains at para. 8 that "...the standard of review is correctness in that a citizenship judge must address (a) whether an applicant has established residence and (b) whether an applicant has maintained that residence. A failure to address either issue is an error of law for which the standard of review is correctness."
