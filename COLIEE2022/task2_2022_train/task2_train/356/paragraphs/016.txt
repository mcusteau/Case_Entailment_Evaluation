The Citizenship Judge did not make any specific findings with respect to the establishment of a residence for Mr. Roberts and the evidence in this regard is weak and almost non-existent. Mr. Roberts lived in a student residence for three months during the material period with the remainder of the time being spent with no fixed address or at his family home in the United States. Rather the Citizenship Court Judge seems to stress that Mr. Roberts intends to establish a residence in Canada once his personal circumstances allow for such. It is well established that a mere intention to establish a residence is insufficient: see
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Italia
, above, at para. 16. Indeed, during his oral submissions the Respondent advised the court that he had established a residence as of June, 2009 which would seem to confirm that no such residence had been established prior to this time or certainly during the material period in question.
