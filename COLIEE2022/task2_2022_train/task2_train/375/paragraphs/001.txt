von Finckenstein, J.
: The applicant is a 36 year-old Kenyan woman. She claims refugee status on the basis of perceived political opinion. In Kenya, she was a member of the Handicapped Mobility Appliances Centre (HAMAC), formed in 1994, with whom she worked to produce and distribute locally-made wheelchairs. She was also secretary for the National League for the Disabled of Kenya (NLDK). Through her membership in these groups, she became involved in advocacy activities with regards to the government's wheelchair purchase policies, which were made through the National Fund for the Disabled of Kenya (NFDK). As the secretary of the NLDK, she investigated why the NFDK was purchasing foreign wheelchairs instead of purchasing locally-made, more sturdy wheelchairs. Being confined to a wheelchair herself, this was a subject of particular interest to her. She claimed that the government was getting sub-standard wheelchairs for free from Asian investors who were receiving business licences in return.
