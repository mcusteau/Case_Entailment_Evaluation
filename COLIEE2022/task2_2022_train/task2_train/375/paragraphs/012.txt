Here, the negative credibility findings were supported by reasons (implausibilities, lack of corroborating evidence that was reasonably available and delay in claiming). With respect to the argument that the Board improperly drew negative inferences or conjectures from the applicant's account of other people's behaviour, it should be noted that a panel is entitled to weigh the claimant's story against what might reasonably be expected in a similar situation. A panel is entitled, in assessing credibility, to rely on criteria such as rationality and common sense. See: Shahamati v. Canada (M.E.I.), [1994] F.C.J. No. 415. For instance, in the absence of an explanation as to why her colleagues in Kenya might be unwilling to provide support to her in her refugee claim, the panel was entitled to draw a negative credibility inference. Therefore, there is no basis to the applicant's argument that the Board committed a reviewable error in this regard.
