The Warden's decision refers to the security analyst's summary given to the applicant. That summary reads:
"Inmate TEHRANKARI was interviewed by the Security Analyst at 1350 hours, 20 February 1998.
"Inmate TEHRANKARI was informed that the information referencing 'escape' on his preventive security file (SIR dated 95/12/29, Warkworth Institution) would not be removed. He was provided with a gist of the information, i.e.
that the report makes reference to TEHRANKARI being overheard saying to another inmate that there are several ways someone could escape from WI and it would be easy for him. There is no information contained in this particular report to indicate that he was planning to or attempted to escape.
"Inmate TEHRANKARI would like a statement in his response to make reference to the fact that he presents no current preventive security concerns, which was verified by the IPSO, B. Isaacs in discussion with TEHRANKARI's CMO J. Corrigal who is currently drafting a proposal for transfer to medium security (Bath)." (emphasis mine)
