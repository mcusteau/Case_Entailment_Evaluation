This sidetracking of the applicant's original purpose is also evidenced by the relief the applicant seeks in this judicial review application which are:
(1) an order of mandamus that the CSC provide the information which led to his transfer back to Kingston;
(2) an order for mandamus that CSC accept the responsibility for being negligent in respect of providing reports about the March 12, 1996 assault and yet having no witnesses at the Disciplinary Hearing.
(3) an order for mandamus that CSC was arbitrary in deciding to raise his security level.
