The distinction between "state agents", "rogue officers" and "criminals" raises different considerations in evaluating the effectiveness of state protection. Where the alleged persecutors are state agents, the claimant may be faced with an official policy of persecution, such that state protection may not reasonably be forthcoming. On the other hand, where the assailants are "rogue officers" the analysis will focus on whether the state is in a position to effectively police itself, including the effectiveness of oversight and accountability mechanisms. However, where purely criminal elements are the agents of persecution; the above considerations will be irrelevant in evaluating the effectiveness of state protection.
