In its analysis of state protection against rogue officers, the Board highlighted the existence of anti-corruption measures in Mexico. While extremely laudable, the efforts of any government to investigate and punish instances of corruption are not in and of themselves determinative of the effectiveness of those efforts at an operational level. The Board highlighted the number of corruption-related investigations carried out by the Attorney General's Office, new training initiatives aimed at combating police and judicial corruption, and the existence of a mechanism for filing complaints against public officials as indicative of the government's ability to protect the applicant, but it did not indicate how those initiatives have affected the level of corruption on the ground, and the lives of the civilian population in general. I note, for example, that the ability to make
ex post facto
complaints and commence
ex post facto
investigations of corruption and ill-treatment does not
automatically
constitute effective protection.
