As a preliminary matter, I note that an analysis of state protection does not occur in the abstract (
Montenegro v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2005 FC 1681, [2005] F.C.J. No. 2077 (QL), at para. 17). In the present case, the Board did not come to any determinative conclusions with respect to the identity of the persecuting agents, finding only that they were either rogue officers or criminals parading as officers. The Board reached that finding despite the applicant's sworn, uncontradicted testimony and Personal Information Form indicating that he recognized his assailants as judicial police officers because of previous dealings with them in 1998. While the Board appears to have proceeded in its analysis as if the persecutors were rogue officers, I find the lack of a definitive statement on the matter troubling. Conducting a state protection analysis in the absence of a determination as to the nature of the persecuting agent risks short circuiting a full assessment of the claim.
