The amount of $87,000 is, in my view, justifiable on either the evidence presented by the Plaintiffs and on the use of the "nominal" damages approach. With either approach, I am hampered by the conduct of the Defendants who have refused to come forward to determine a more accurate assessment of damages. While it appears that the Plaintiffs are suffering in the award of damages through no fault of their own, I believe that punitive damages may be helpful in leveling the playing field and resulting in a total award that is just.
