As to the amount of such solicitor-client costs, I am satisfied that a lump sum award is warranted. This award would compensate for legal fees incurred to date, legal fees not yet billed and estimated legal fees for preparing and arguing this motion for default judgment. The award will also cover disbursements of $6879.14. Having reviewed the evidence submitted, I am satisfied that the costs and disbursements claimed have been reasonably incurred in pursuit of this action. Accordingly, in respect of solicitor-client costs and disbursements and based on the evidence filed, I will award a lump sum of $36,699.14.
