The only evidence that is helpful in this difficult job is the evidence from the investigators that, on at least three of the other occasions when they attended at K2 Fashions, other accessories bearing the LV Trade-mark were seen. Thus, I am prepared to conclude, applying some logic to the situation, that the goods that were seen in the store or were likely present or available for purchase were, in fact, sold. A conservative estimate of profits for the items available for sale on those occasions is, in my view, roughly $15,000 per incident - for a total of $45,000.
