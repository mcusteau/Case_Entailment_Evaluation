The first factor to consider is the good or bad faith of the Defendants. The second factor is the conduct of the Defendants. In this case, these factors are linked. I refer to the following:
1. The Defendants have been aware since December 2001, when an Anton Piller Order was executed, that the sale of the counterfeit products was in violation of the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights. Nevertheless, they have persisted in selling infringing products.
2. The Plaintiffs have obtained two previous judgments, the first on April 26, 2002, the second on June 8, 2004, restraining the sale of infringing products in the K2 Fashions store. The infringing activity has continued.
3. The Defendants have been advised numerous times to stop the sale of products infringing on the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights since the June 8, 2004 judgment, but have nevertheless persisted in their infringing activities.
4. The Defendants have attempted to conceal and cover-up their actions by placing the counterfeit products in hidden displays and drawers.
