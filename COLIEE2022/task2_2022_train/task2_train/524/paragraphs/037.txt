With respect to estimates of the costs of these goods, the affidavit of the Senior Anticounterfeiting Manager for North America of Louis Vuitton was very comprehensive and persuasive. Using her calculations, I would agree that a cost to the Defendants would likely be no more than $18 per item. Thus, the Plaintiffs' estimate of $31,186 for profits for goods delivered up in March 2006 and March 2007 events is reasonable. This amount is calculated by subtracting the costs per item seized from the sale value of items seized.
