Snider, J.
: Since at least 2001, the Plaintiffs have been attempting to stop the sale of counterfeit Louis Vuitton products at K2 Fashions, a retail store located in Richmond, British Columbia. In spite of two judgments of this Court, numerous letters, seizures and other actions taken by the Plaintiffs, they have failed to shut down the K2 Fashions illegal actions. Most recently, the Plaintiffs commenced this action on July 5, 2007. The Plaintiffs claim that the Defendants, who control and operate K2 Fashions, have infringed and passed off counterfeit Louis Vuitton products making use of the Plaintiffs' trade-marks, in contravention of provisions of the
Trade-marks Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13,and have sold products that infringe the Plaintiffs' copyright, in contravention of the
Copyright Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42. Having received no response to their Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs have brought this motion for default judgment.
