Turning now to the fairness issue, I find that in these particular circumstances, Gao was owed more than an abstract opportunity to make representations to the Immigration Officer. His last information was the rather hopeful Glendale report, followed by the March 1991 letter from immigration to the effect that "we hope to be contacting you soon with more information". Then came the December 1991 decision finding the applicant inadmissible. Gao was not given a fair opportunity to make submissions before that decision.
