Applying these considerations to the case at bar, I find that the medical opinion of January 1988 was unreasonable at the time it was relied on by the Immigration Officer in December 1991, and that the Immigration Officer's decision of Qi's inadmissibility based on that opinion was patently unreasonable. It is apparent, from the March 1991 letter to Gao, that immigration officials were awaiting HW's assessment of the Glendale report in order to arrive at a decision. When it was received in November 1991, HW's M5 assessment was inconsistent with the M7 assessment of 1988. It most certainly was not a "confirmation" of it as submitted on behalf of the Minister. Thus, the decision of inadmissibility was made despite the contradictory HW assessment based on the more recent Glendale report which indicated the January 1988 Medical Notification was, in fact, no longer reasonable (as Gao's counsel pointed out, the M5 assessment is also inconsistent with the T5 notation appearing on the January 1988 notification).
