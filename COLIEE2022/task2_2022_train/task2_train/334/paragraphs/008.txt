In 1986, Gao's wife and his son Qi, born in China in 1982, arrived in Canada on visitors' visas. Both had been assessed by Health and Welfare officials in Shanghai. Qi had been found healthy and assessed M1 ("no health impairment sufficient to prevent admission under [s. 19(1)(a)]" (
Immigration Manual, Selection and Control
, vol. 1, c. 8, "Medical Requirements and Examinations", Appendix "A"). In the fall of 1987 Gao informed immigration officials Qi was attending a special school because of developmental delay. Qi, then 5, was required to undergo a second medical assessment. Dr. Kelly Chu ("Dr. Chu"), the examining physician in Victoria, diagnosed "mental retardation", with no degree of severity specified, and characterized Qi's prognosis as "guarded" in view of that finding. Dr. Chu's report was forwarded to the Ottawa Health and Welfare section responsible for medical assessments for immigration services ("HW").
