As I understand it, the results of a medical examination completed by a designated medical practitioner for immigration purposes are forwarded to a Health and Welfare medical officer for review. If the officer determines the applicant is inadmissible on medical grounds, the file must be submitted for review to a second medical officer. Should the second officer concur, relevant immigration authorities are so informed by means of a standard official document called a "Medical Notification". This form, signed by the concurring officers, contains the medical opinion which is comprised of two distinct features: a Medical Profile containing coded notations concerning the applicant's condition, prognosis and treatment needs, as well as a narrative component containing the applicant's diagnosis and the medical officers' finding under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Act
