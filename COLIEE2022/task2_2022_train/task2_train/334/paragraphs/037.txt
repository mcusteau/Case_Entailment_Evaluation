Consequently, I am of the view that the Immigration Officer failed in his or her duty to act fairly. The circumstances are analogous to those of the
Muliadi
case (supra). There a visa officer denied an application for permanent residence on the basis of a negative third party assessment of the applicant's proposed business venture, which assessment was not disclosed to the applicant prior to the decision. The court found as follows (at pp. 216-217):
"In the circumstances ... he should have had an opportunity of meeting the negative assessment ... before it was acted upon by the visa officer, for upon that assessment his application turned. The duty of fairness extends to this kind of case. In this I would adopt the views expressed ... in
In re H.K. (An Infant)
, [1967] 2 Q.B. 617, at page 630:
'[...] [E]ven if an immigration officer is not in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity, he must at any rate give the immigrant an opportunity of satisfying him in the matters of the subsection, and for that purpose let the immigrant know what his immediate impression is so that the immigrant can disabuse him. [...]'

"Had the appellant been informed of that assessment before it was decided to reject that application, he might have been able to look into the matter and, possibly, to disabuse the visa officer of his view."
