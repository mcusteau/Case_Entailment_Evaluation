With respect, however, it seems that
Gwala
was, as the learned judge herself seemed to suspect, incorrectly decided on the issue of whether this court has jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges in the circumstances at bar. There are two reasons: the expanded provisions of the
Federal Court Act
which were not in place when
Poirier v. Canada (Minister of Veterans Affairs)
, [1989] 3 F.C. 233; 96 N.R. 34 (F.C.A.) or
TÃ©treault-Gadoury
were decided (but referred to by Nadon, J., in
Mobarakizadeh
, above); and second, that a tribunal which bases its decision on a constitutionally invalid provision commits a jurisdictional error. Thus, by implication, in order to determine whether a decision-maker acted within its jurisdiction, the constitutionality of the conferring provision must be assessed.
