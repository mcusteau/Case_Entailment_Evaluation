The applicant's counsel propounded a further question about a senior immigration officer having jurisdiction to allow for a constitutional exemption to refer an individual to the Convention Refugee Determination Division despite that individual's being subject to an unexecuted removal order. In view of the court's discussion and findings articulated in earlier paragraphs hereof, the court declines to certify such question.
