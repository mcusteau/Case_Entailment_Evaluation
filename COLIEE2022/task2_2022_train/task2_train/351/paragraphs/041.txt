[41]
This provision makes it clear that the Minister's consent is required when a person voluntarily "executes" a deportation order and the failure to obtain such consent results in the removal order not being executed. The
Act
as it read when
Ramkissoon
was determined did not have a similar provision. Rather, the
Act
provided that:
"33(2) Unless otherwise directed by the Minister or an immigration officer in charge, a person against whom a deportation order has been made may be requested or allowed to leave Canada voluntarily."
