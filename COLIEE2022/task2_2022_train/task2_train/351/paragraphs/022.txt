Accordingly, declarations of invalidity may be granted by this court, even in regard to constitutional matters where the acts of a decision-maker have the effect of infringing a person's rights as guaranteed under the
Charter
, (noted is
Mobarakizadeh v. Canada
(1993), 72 F.T.R. 30 (T.D.)). There is no reason why a declaration of invalidity of a section of an Act, pursuant to
Charter
s. 52, cannot be made when one has regard to the power to declare a decision "unlawful" under
Federal Court Act
s. 18.1 as contravening the
Charter
.
