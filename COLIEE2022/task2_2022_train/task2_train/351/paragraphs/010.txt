The applicant was informed, on April 10, 1997, by a senior immigration office (SIO), that his claim could not be referred to the CRDD on the basis that the applicant is a person against whom a removal order has been made but not executed, under s. 44 of the
Immigration Act
.
This section provides that:
"44(1) Any person who is in Canada, other than a person against whom a removal order has been made but not executed, unless an appeal from that order has been allowed, and who claims to be a Convention refugee may seek a determination of the claim by notifying an immigration officer.
"(2) An immigration officer who is notified pursuant to subs. (1) shall forthwith refer the claim to a senior immigration officer.
"(3) Where a person who is the subject of an inquiry claims in accordance with subs. (1) to be a Convention refugee, the adjudicator shall determine whether the person may be permitted to come into or remain in Canada, as the case may be, and shall take the appropriate action under s. 32(1), (3) or (4) or s. 32.1, as the case may be, in respect of the person.
"(4) Where a claim to be a Convention refugee by a person who is the subject of an inquiry is referred to a senior immigration officer and the senior immigration officer determines, before the conclusion of the inquiry, that the person is not eligible to have the claim determined by the Refugee Division, the adjudicator shall take the appropriate action under s. 32 in respect of the person.
"(5) Subject to ss. 46.3 and 46.4 where a person makes more than one claim to be a Convention refugee, those claims are, for the purposes of this Act, deemed to be a single claim."
