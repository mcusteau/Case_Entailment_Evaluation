issues when the tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to hear the issue is impractical as it would be costly and time consuming to institute two separate proceedings: one to challenge the decision via judicial review and the second by way of action challenging the validity of a provision of an Act. At p. 623 he noted:
"If respondent's counsel's position is correct, applicants seeking relief from decisions of immigration officers would be required to choose between different processes depending upon the grounds to be advanced by them. This could lead to two processes having to be instituted in a case such as the one at bar; an application for judicial review for some grounds and an action for a declaration for others. This multiplicity of procedures would apply only in certain circumstances, i.e., when the tribunal whose decision is being challenged did not have jurisdiction to decide a question of law. I see no useful purpose to such a multiplicity of procedures. On the contrary, the confusion and additional cost inherent in them are clear disadvantages. I do not think Parliament intended to complicate access to the Federal Court by creating an obscure requirement for the commencement of proceedings by way of action in cases such as the one at bar. It has not been demonstrated that the court would be impeded from performing its functions or that any party would be prejudiced by there being only one process, that is judicial review, for seeking relief in this court from decisions of immigration officers."
