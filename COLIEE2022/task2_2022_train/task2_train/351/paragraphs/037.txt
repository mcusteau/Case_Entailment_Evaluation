Accordingly, s. 7 of the
Charter
, it would appear, is not engaged and the analysis on this section does not need to proceed further. The issue of whether s. 44(1) of the
Immigration Act
offends against s. 7 of the
Charter
was never raised by the applicant or his counsel before the decision maker, the senior immigration officer. But, why would it be, if the SIO had no jurisdiction to decide it? The court's decision in
Sivaraj
, noted and quoted earlier above, argues for the necessity of bringing an action for a declaration rather than judicial review, in order to achieve the applicant's objectives in these circumstances. That decision was unanimously affirmed, as noted, in one short paragraph by the Appeal Division. At the hearing the applicant's counsel stated, without documentation, that
"... the issue of allowing for a constitutional exemption was put before the immigration officer. It was put before him in January. It is true, it was put ... I admit it was put before him late, but it was put before him, and he did not respond to that." (transcript: p. 129)
The respondent's counsel, in reply, made reference to the Appeal Division's decision expressed by Linden, J.A., in
Grewal v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 135 N.R. 310 (F.C.A.), but the circumstances there are not readily transposable to the outcome here.
