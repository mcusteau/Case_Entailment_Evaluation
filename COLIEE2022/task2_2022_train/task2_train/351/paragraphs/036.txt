Similarly, in
Nguyen v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1993] 1 F.C. 696; 151 N.R. 69 (F.C.A.), Mr. Justice Marceau stated at p. 704:
"A foreigner has no absolute right to be recognized as a political refugee under either the common law or any international convention to which Canada has adhered. It follows that legislation which purports to define conditions for eligibility to claim refugee status may violate the
Charter
only if those conditions have the effect of subjecting a group of claimants to discriminatory treatment within the meaning of s. 15. To deny dangerous criminals the right, generally conceded to immigrants who flee persecution, to seek refuge in Canada certainly cannot be seen as a form of illegitimate discrimination. Only s. 15 of the
Charter
is engaged since, contrary to the first decision which entailed forced deportation and therefore deprivation of liberty, a declaration of ineligibility does not imply or lead, in itself, to any positive act which may affect life, liberty or security of the person."
