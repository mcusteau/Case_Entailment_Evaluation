Madam Justice Desjardins of the Court of Appeal in an article entitled
Review of Administrative Action in the Federal Court of Canada: The New Style in Pluralist Setting
in Special Lectures of the Law Society of Upper Canada (Carswell, 1992, p. 405) noted that s. 18.1(4)(f) was enacted in order to allow the court to consider constitutional issues on applications for judicial review. At p. 431 to 432 she noted that:
"It has been suggested, moreover, that this final ground of review might permit the court to determine whether a given decision is contrary to the
Charter
, particularly where the tribunal is without jurisdiction to determine
Charter
questions. This possibility should be reflected upon in light of the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
Tétreault-Gadoury v. Canada (Employment and Immigration Commission)
. In
Tétreault-Gadoury
, the Supreme Court held that where an administrative tribunal does not have jurisdiction to entertain a question of law, the Federal Court of Appeal is also without jurisdiction to decide the constitutional matter ...
"... But,
Tétreault-Gadoury
, of course, was based on s. 28 as formerly known. Whether para. 18.1(4)(f) constitutes remedial legislation which changes the law as established by
Tétreault-Gadoury
is an open question. In the affirmative, fresh evidence on
Charter
issues should be tendered."
