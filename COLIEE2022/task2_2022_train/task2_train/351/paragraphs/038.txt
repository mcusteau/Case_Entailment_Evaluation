The applicant's second argument is that the SIO erred in holding that the applicant had not executed his removal order by voluntarily leaving Canada. In support of this argument, the applicant cites
Ramkissoon v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration
, [1978] 2 F.C. 290; 20 N.R. 361 (F.C.A.), in which the Court of Appeal held that a person who had voluntarily left Canada after having a deportation order issued against him could not have recourse to appeal the deportation order to the Immigration Appeal Board as his deportation was "executed". At p. 294 Mr. Justice Heald wrote:
"With deference, I am unable to agree that the ordinary dictionary meaning of 'removal' is so narrow as to preclude a person from 'removing' himself from Canada to 'the place whence he came to Canada' which is exactly what transpired in the case at bar. 'Remove' is defined, inter alia, in The
Shorter Oxford English Dictionary
as 'to go away or depart from a place' and 'to change one's place of residence'. Both of these definitions are capable of including a positive voluntary act on the part of the person concerned. Thus, in my view, on the facts here present, 'removal' from Canada to Trinidad by this applicant was accomplished on March 16, 1975 and the effect of that 'removal' was to 'execute' the first deportation order. Accordingly, it seems to me that the legal effect of the applicant's voluntarily leaving Canada was that he was thereby deprived of any status entitling him to appeal against the first deportation order under the equitable s. 15 jurisdiction of the Board."
