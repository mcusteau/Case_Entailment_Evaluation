The applicant, it should be remembered, made a refugee claim in 1988. It was found to have no credible basis, and was rejected. If the applicant had left Canada in accordance with the
Act
, he would have been able to claim refugee status again upon re-entering Canada in August, 1996, because more than 90 days would have elapsed after he previously last came into Canada.

Immigration Act
, but, no, he had to do it his way in disregard for the law.
