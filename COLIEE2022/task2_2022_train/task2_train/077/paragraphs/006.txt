  The officer charged with evaluating Ms. Ferguson's claim agreed, without reservation, on the basis of documentary evidence, that lesbians in Jamaica are at risk of severe physical abuse on account of their sexual orientation. The officer nonetheless dismissed the application on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to establish that Ms. Ferguson is lesbian. The officer wrote as follows: 
 
 
 
 Aside from the brief statement that the applicant is a "lesbian and is very open about her sexual orientation", I have not been provided with supporting evidence that establishes, on the balance of probabilities that, the applicant is a homosexual. Without sufficient evidence that the applicant is a lesbian, an assessment of current country conditions does not establish that she is personally at risk in Jamaica. 
 
 
 
 Thus, while independent research confirms violence against homosexuals in Jamaica, there is insufficient objective evidence before me to establish that the applicant is, on the balance of probabilities, a lesbian.
