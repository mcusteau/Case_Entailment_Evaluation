  In summary, the Board erred in its state protection analysis in two ways: first, by focusing on the applicants' alleged inadequate reporting to the police with no regard to the practical significance of that reporting to the real issue of state protection; and second, by focusing almost exclusively on the efforts being made by the Hungarian government to curb persecution against the Roma, with little or no attention paid to the operational effectiveness of those measures. For those reasons, the Board's decision must be set aside.
