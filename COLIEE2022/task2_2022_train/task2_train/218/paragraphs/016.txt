  Where persecution is widespread and indiscriminate, and unless a claimant is repeatedly targeted by the same individual(s), I fail to understand how it can be said that individual attempts to engage the authorities will have significant, persuasive evidentiary value as to the state's ability to protect against future, indiscriminate violence. In those cases, documentary evidence, rather than individual attempts to seek protection, is more relevant to the state protection analysis. As discussed below, the Board in this case did review the documentary evidence; however, one cannot escape the conclusion reading the decision as a whole that the applicants' perceived inadequate attempts to engage the police not only figured prominently, but were decisive in the Board's analysis. That legal error - which is to place a  
 legal 
  burden of seeking state protection on a refugee claimant - is unreasonable and itself sufficient to warrant granting this application.
