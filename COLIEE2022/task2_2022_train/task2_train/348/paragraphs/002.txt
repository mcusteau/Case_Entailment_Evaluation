During the course of the hearing before me, the respondent brought a motion pursuant to rule 324 of the
Federal Court Rules
for an order striking out certain paragraphs and exhibits from the affidavits of Greg Carter and Mike Coulthard. I am granting that application on the grounds that the impugned paragraphs and exhibits contain statements that merely reiterate evidence which was before the Adjudicator and contain legal argument and statements of opinion.
