There have been cases in our court in which the right to seizure, the right to enter premises, the right to affect a number of draconian measures under the
Income Tax Act
have been found to be invalid. Noteworthy is the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
Baron et al. v. Minister of National Revenue et al.
, [1991] C.T.C. 5055; 122 N.R. 47 (F.C.A.), that Revenue Canada's use of search warrants obtained under s. 231.3 of the
Income Tax Act
violates the right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure. The court (at p. 5058) found that the use of the term "shall" deprived the issuing officer of any residual discretion and for that reason alone the provision ran afoul of ss. 7 and 8 of the
Charter
. Important for our purposes is that unlike s. 225.2, the court found that s. 231.3 was concerned with the detection and prosecution of crime and, therefore, "nothing less than the full panoply of
Charter
protection is appropriate". Furthermore, the constitutional validity of a particular statutory provision was in question in
Baron
and other similar cases.
