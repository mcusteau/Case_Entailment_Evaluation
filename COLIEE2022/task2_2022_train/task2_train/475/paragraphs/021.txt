This test continues to be appropriate despite the 1985 amendments:
Minister of National Revenue v. Satellite Earth Station Technology Inc.
, 89 D.T.C. 5506, [1989] 2 C.T.C. 291; 30 F.T.R. 94 (F.C.T.D.). In
Satellite Earth
, MacKay, J., reviewed the factors to be considered by a court on a s. 225.2(8) review of a jeopardy collection order. After considering the case law dealing with the former version of s. 225.2 he concluded (at D.T.C. 5510) that in a s. 225.2(8) application the Minister has the ultimate burden of justifying the decision despite the fact that s. 225.2 as amended no longer includes the former paragraph (5) that specifically stated that "on the hearing of an application under paragraph 2(c), the burden of justifying the decision is on the Minister". However, the initial burden is on the taxpayer to show that there are reasonable grounds to doubt that the test has been met.
"In an application to review a 'jeopardy order' originally granted under paragraph 225.2(2) the issue will be whether that Order will now be set aside or varied. In this, an applicant under paragraph 225.2(8) has the initial burden to muster evidence, whether by affidavits, by cross-examination of affiants on behalf of the Crown, or both, that there are reasonable grounds to doubt that the test required by paragraph 225.2(2) has been met. Thus the ultimate burden on the Crown established by paragraph 225.2(2) continues when an order granted by the court is reviewed under paragraph 225.2(8).
"Occasionally there may be concern about whether the Order should have been made initially, but I expect that this will not often be the principal focus, unless there appears to have been a serious procedural flaw in the original application.
"... The evidence must be considered in relation to the test established by paragraph 225.2(2) itself and by relevant cases, that is, whether on a balance of probability the evidence leads to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that collection would be jeopardized by delay."
