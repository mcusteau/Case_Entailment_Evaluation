Mere suspicion that collection will be jeopardized by the delay is not sufficient:
1853-9049 Québec Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue
(1986), 9 F.T.R. 63; 87 D.T.C. 5093 (F.C.T.D.). In
1853-9049 Québec Inc.
, Rouleau, J. (at pp. 142-143), provided additional guidance with respect to the test set out in the former s. 225.2 which continues to be appropriate today:
"I agree with McNair, J. [in
Danielson
] when he says that the Minister can require payment of the assessment forthwith if a taxpayer may not be in a position to pay
simply because of the passage of time
allowed by the
Act
. The amount of money involved is not significant:
what the Minister has to know is whether the taxpayer's assets can be liquidated in the meantime or be seized by other creditors and so not available to him
.
"... In my opinion, this latitude allows the Minister to rely on the exceptional provisions contained in subsection 225.2(1)
whenever, on a balance of probability, the time allowed by the taxpayer by subsection 225.1(1) would jeopardize his debt
. I emphasize on a balance of probability, not beyond all reasonable doubt. ...
"... The Minister may certainly act not only in cases of fraud or situations amounting to fraud, but also in cases
where the taxpayer may waste, liquidate or otherwise transfer his property to escape the tax authorities
: in short, to meet any situation in which a taxpayer's assets may vanish into thin air because of the passage of time. ..." (Emphasis added)
