[15]
After carefully considering the extensive argument put forth by the parties I find that the
Charter
should not form a part of the judgment in this matter for the following reasons. First, the parties acknowledge that the relevant sections of the
Income Tax Act
are not under attack in this application and they cannot be attacked in a proceeding of this nature. In
Rothmans of Pall Mall Canada Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue
, [1976] 2 F.C. 512; 10 N.R. 153 (C.A.), at p. 515, Le Dain, J.A. (as he then was), on behalf of the court, held that "under the
Rules
declaratory relief cannot be sought by originating motion but only by an action". More recently, in
Turmel v. C.R.T.C.
(1985), 16 C.R.R. 9 (F.C.T.D.), Dub√©, J., explained this requirement (at p. 11):
"I appreciate that time was and still is of the essence ... but constitutional matters cannot be solved on such a summary proceeding. The solution is for the application to proceed by way of a declaratory action that would allow for pleadings and discovery. The court, apprised of all the relevant facts and with the benefit of legal arguments, would then be in a position to adjudge whether or not the equitable basis principle as interpreted by the court is now in violation of s. 15 of the
Charter
."
