The respondents submit that the ex parte order dated July 18, 1989 pursuant to s. 225.2(2) of the
Income Tax Act
is contrary to ss. 7 and 8 of the
Charter
although they concede that the statutory provision itself is not under attack in this proceeding. They suggest, however, that the deficiencies contained in s. 225.2 can be "read down" for our present purposes and that the order should be measured against the statutory provisions as properly interpreted in accordance with the
Charter
. In the alternative, the respondents submit that the order constitutes an unreasonable seizure in that it does not comply with the stringent requirements for a reasonable search and seizure enunciated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Southam Inc. v. Hunter
, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145; 55 N.R. 241; 55 A.R. 291; 9 C.R.R. 355; 14 C.C.C.(3d) 97; 41 C.R.(3d) 97; [1984] 6 W.W.R. 577; 33 Alta. L.R.(2d) 193; 27 B.L.R. 297; 84 D.T.C. 6467; 2 C.P.R.(3d) 1; 11 D.L.R.(4th) 641. The order authorizing immediate collection action is an unreasonable seizure because it was made upon virtually no evidence or credibly-based probability that such actions were required to prevent evasion of the payment of the assessed taxes such as to prevail over the respondents' rights to be "left alone".
