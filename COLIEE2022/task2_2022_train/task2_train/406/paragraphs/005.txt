In
Chen v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
[see footnote 2], Mr. Justice Rothstein wrote:
"As I read the definition of 'Investor' in the
Immigration Regulations, 1978
, an applicant need only demonstrate that he has successfully either operated or controlled or directed a business or commercial undertaking. The words in context are disjunctive. It is therefore incumbent on the visa officer to assess each aspect separately to determine whether an applicant falls under at least one of the criteria. In my view, the visa officer did not do so in this case. She seems to have concluded from the fact that the applicant was not involved in the operation of the farm, that he also did not control or direct it. In coming to her conclusion, she failed to give a distinct meaning to each of the words operated, controlled or directed.
"From the fact that the applicant did not operate the farm it does not follow automatically that he did not control or direct it."
On the facts that were before the visa officer in this matter, it was clear that the applicant did not control or direct the business by which he was employed. However, whether he "operated" the business was another matter. In
Cheng v. Canada (Secretary of State)
[see footnote 3], Mr. Justice Cullen, after referring to the
Chen
decision, wrote:
"However, as I read her [the visa officer's] reasoning as expressed in the letter to the applicant ... and her affidavit ..., I believe that she has imported additional requirements into the criteria for qualifying for the investor program, namely the operation, or responsibility for the operation, of the company as a whole. Indeed, if she found that the applicant was responsible for the operation of an integral, profit-generating part of the business, then he ought to have met the criteria absent some other factor."
