  The Board misunderstood the relevance of the Minister's evidence. The Minister filed evidence which indicates a photograph taken using the "Advanced Photo System" is date-stamped on the back of the photograph. The date stamp represents the date the photograph was taken. In this case, the photograph produced by Mr. Navarrete stated "Advanced Photo System JAN 1/97." The conclusion to be drawn from the Minister's evidence is that the photograph could not be taken in 1999, but was taken in 1997.
