  In this conclusion, I agree with the decision of my colleague Justice MacKay in  
 Comeau 
 , supra. Although the monies in question in that case consisted of certain RRSP funds that Ms. Comeau had cashed in rather than the pay equity settlement in this case, Justice MacKay's reasoning on this issue of jurisdiction is equally applicable to the facts before me. As in that case, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the Review Tribunal to dictate how the Minister was to treat the matter of her income for the year in question.
