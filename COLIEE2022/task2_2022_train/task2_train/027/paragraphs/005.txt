  The Applicant submits that the Review Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear Ms. Heaman's appeal; that the  
 OASA 
  required the Commissioner of Review Tribunals to refer Ms. Heaman's appeal to the Tax Court of Canada. This application raises a question of law. In the domain of statutory interpretation, the Review Tribunal possesses no superior expertise relative to this Court. A Review Tribunal consists of three persons, only one of whom is required to be a member of the bar of a province ( 
 OASA 
 , s. 82(7)(a)). The purpose of the  
 OASA 
  is not stated anywhere in the statute and the  
 Canada Pension Plan 
  contains neither a right of appeal nor a privitive clause in respect of Review Tribunal decisions. Thus, the applicable standard of review is correctness. This standard of review was also accepted by Justice MacKay in  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Comeau 
 , [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 612; 2004 FC 1034, a case dealing with a similar application.
