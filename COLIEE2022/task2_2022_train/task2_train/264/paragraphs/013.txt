The question that needs to be answered in the present matter is whether or not the applicant received adequate or reasonable notice that the Board intended to review the stay. On May 16, 2005, the case management officer of the IAD sent a letter to the applicant's representative and the respondent. She wrote the following:
"In accordance with the order of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Appeal Division signed the 6th day of January 2005, the execution of a removal order made against you was stayed.
"This is to advise you that the Appeal Division will proceed with the interim reconsideration of this stay on or about the 1st day of November 2005.
Please advise the IAD of the opportunity of a review in chambers or a review by oral hearing by producing arguments and/or documents by or before the 1st day of September 2005
. Neither the appellant nor the respondent is required to attend this review.
"However, the Appeal Division may decide that an oral hearing is necessary. In the event the Appeal Division decides there should be an oral hearing, you will be given at least 30 days notice in accordance with Rule 14(2) of the
Immigration Appeal Division Rules
.
"You will be informed of the Appeal Division decision as soon as possible."
