  With respect to the issue of complexity, there is divergence in the case law as to how patent litigation is to be treated. For example, in  
 Apotex Inc. v. Syntex 
 , supra, at para. 9, the Court suggested that patent cases are generally more complex than non-patent cases and thus merit being assessed above Column III level costs.
