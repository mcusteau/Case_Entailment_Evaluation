 [43] 
  Article 1392 C.c.Q., upon which the plaintiff relies, indicates that "[a] n offer lapses [...] in respect of the offeree if he has rejected it". However, Rule 420 was established to deal specifically with this type of situation where a party has rejected an offer to settle. It is precisely when the offeree refuses an offer to settle that the application of r.420 is triggered. For the plaintiff, an award of double costs is barred when an offer to settle is rejected; however, to interpret article 1392 C.c.Q. in this manner would, in effect, render r. 420 inapplicable.
