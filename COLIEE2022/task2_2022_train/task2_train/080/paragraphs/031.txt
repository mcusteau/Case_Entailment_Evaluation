  In the present case, the defendant, "[...] failed to comply with not one but two orders of this Court requiring it to serve its affidavit of documents on the Plaintiff within a 10 day delay [...]." Prothonotary Tabib indicated that, in the circumstances, she "would have to infer that the Defendant deliberately prioritized the preparation and serving of its motion for summary judgement [sic] over compliance with this Court's order." While Prothonotary Tabib did indicate that the plaintiff itself contributed to the delay by failing to promptly bring its motion after the defendant breached the court order, I note that the defendant's conduct did cause delays in the action.
