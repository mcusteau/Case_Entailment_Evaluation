  In the present case, I recognize that it was reasonable and necessary for the defendants to obtain an expert

  The case involved matters necessitating the explanations of expert witnesses. Thus, I will allow fees for the work of the defendant's expert including his attendance at trial, the amount to be determined by the taxing officer.
