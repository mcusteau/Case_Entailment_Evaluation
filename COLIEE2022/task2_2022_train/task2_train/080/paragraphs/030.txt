  A party's actions may also affect the costs assessed. In  
 Glaxo Group Ltd. et al. v. Novopharm Ltd. 
 , [1999] 3 C.P.R. (4th) 333 (QL), at paras. 18 and 31, the Federal Court responded unfavourably to tactics employed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff took under advisement and objected to 3,000 questions at the examination which caused significant delays and consumed an undue quality of judicial resources. The Court found that an award of party-and-party costs would be fully justified in the circumstances.
