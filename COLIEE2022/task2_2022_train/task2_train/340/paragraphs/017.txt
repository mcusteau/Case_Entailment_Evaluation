The administration of this program falls on the immigration officer. That officer, subject to the criteria set forth in s. 5 of the Regulations has discretion to make a finding on as ubiquitous an enquiry as one to determine "successful establishment" in the country. The process is not by way of trial with its traditional adversarial thrust but by an interview where on the basis of the information provided by the applicant, the immigration officer must make an assessment and decide on the issue one way or the other. The factors to be considered provide the necessary focus on the enquiry but essentially, the immigration officer must make his own judgment call. And this judgment call must be made expeditiously and, equally important, fairly.
