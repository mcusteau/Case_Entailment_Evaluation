Section 5(2) of the Regulations, although directed to the same purpose, imposes different factors. This section only applies if no determination can be made under the previous section. In this event, the direction to the immigration officer is to have regard to what might be termed soft data as against hard data. The enquiry must be directed to the applicant's record of employment in an occupation that he is prepared to follow in Canada; to the job market in Canada for his occupational skills; to his educational level and its impact on employment opportunities; to his language skills; to financial and other assistance obtainable from a relative in Canada; to a character assessment based on adaptability, motivation, resourcefulness and similar qualities; and finally, to the applicant's family obligations.
