Section 5 of the Regulations lists two sets of factors. The first set, in s. 5(1), lists five of them. Each factor in this set establishes purely economic criteria based on exclusive Canadian experience. They are directed to stability of employment; the length of time of employment in relation to time spent in Canada; the frequency and reasons for turnover in employment; the present income and future income prospects out of current employment; and finally, the applicant's family obligations.
