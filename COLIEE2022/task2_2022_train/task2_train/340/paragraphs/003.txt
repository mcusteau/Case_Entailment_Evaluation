The applicant applies to this court under s. 18 of the Federal Court Act to quash the immigration officer's decision and for an order directing the respondents to grant the applicant permanent landing in Canada. The applicant contends that the foregoing decision was based on incorrect consideration in law. More particularly, it is alleged that the applicant's links with members of his family residing outside of Canada are improper or inapplicable considerations in determining his fitness to be granted permanent landing under the scheme.
