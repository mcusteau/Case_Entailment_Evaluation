Finally, I should refer to s. 2 of the Immigration Act, 1978 where "family" is defined as meaning:
"... the father and mother and any children who, by reason of age or disability, are, in the opinion of am immigration officer, mainly dependent upon the father or mother for support and, for the purpose of any provision of this Act and the regulations, includes such other classes of persons as are prescribed for the purpose of that provision."
