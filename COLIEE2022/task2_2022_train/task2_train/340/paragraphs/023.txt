A letter confirming the foregoing was forwarded to the applicant on January 6, 1987. After stating that the applicant was not eligible for consideration as a member of the family class described in s. 4(1) of the Immigration Regulations, 1978, the immigration officer stated:
"Based on your interview, I was unable to assess you as having the potential to support a family of your size (i.e. yourself, your wife, and 3 children) in Canada. Although you have maintained employment with the same employer since March 1983, your documented earnings for 1984 were only $14,381 and, even with piece work, your anticipated future earnings would continue to fall short of the $24,252 salary required to support a family of your size. You have no training or experience as a skilled labourer, and your prospects of gaining employment that would generate an income sufficient to support your family are not encouraging.
"You provided evidence that you have accumulated over $10,000 in savings which you intend using to purchase your own house. However, I do not believe that your resources would adequately meet your financial obligations and provide for your family.
"It does not appear that you would be met with undue hardship should you return to India, and your case was not, therefore, favourably assessed on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
"As you have indicated your wish to be considered a Convention refugee, your case will continue and will be processed on a priority basis."
