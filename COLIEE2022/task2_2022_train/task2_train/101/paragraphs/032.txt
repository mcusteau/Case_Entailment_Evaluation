 [32] 
  With respect to the list of factors that were set out in the Guidelines, the Officer explicitly addressed most of the ones that were relevant, namely, the fact that Mr. Dennehy had been convicted and sentenced for assaulting the Applicant; her degree of establishment and length of time in Canada; the hardship that would result if she had to leave Canada; and her family network in St. Lucia who could assist with her reintegration there. There was no need to address the issue of pregnancy or the interests of a Canadian child, although the Officer did address the interests of the Applicant's daughter in St. Lucia. As to the genuineness of the Applicant's marriage, this was never questioned by the Officer. Finally, as to the customs and culture factor, the Officer noted that the Applicant claimed that she would be ostracized by family and friends in St. Lucia due to the fact that she pursued charges against Mr. Dennehy. It was at this point that the Officer then turned to the issue of state protection.
