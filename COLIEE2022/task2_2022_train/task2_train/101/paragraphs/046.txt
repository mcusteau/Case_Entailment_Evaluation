 [46] 
  The Applicant suggested that consideration be given to certifying a question as to whether it is necessary for a PRRA Officer to apply the Guidelines in a manner that will encourage sponsored immigrants who are experiencing abuse in their relationship to separate from their sponsor, by recognizing the situation of abuse as grounds for granting the Applicant permanent resident status on H&C grounds. As an alternative to this question, the Applicant suggested that I certify the following question: 
 
 
 
 Whether in assessing a humanitarian and compassionate application under section 25(1) of the IRPA, the failure to apply the guidelines on "Family Violence" in IP 5 in a manner that would encourage a sponsored applicant to separate from an abuser, rather than continue to endure abuse in order to continue the sponsorship arrangement, is contrary to the policy objective of the "Family Violence" guidelines, and is therefore an unreasonable exercise of discretion under section 25(1) of the IRPA.
