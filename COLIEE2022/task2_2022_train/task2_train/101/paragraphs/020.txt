 [20] 
  With respect to the Applicant's other alleged risks of hardship, the Officer in each case reasonably considered the Applicant's evidence and concluded that she had not provided sufficient information to establish her claims. Relying on this Court's decision in  
 Davoudifar v. 
   
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 316, the Officer correctly noted that it was not sufficient for the Applicant to simply demonstrate that she has developed personal and community ties and that she and her supporters or loved ones would be far happier and better off if she remained in Canada. That should not be particularly difficult to demonstrate for anyone who has lived in Canada for a significant period of time and developed strong personal relationships and other ties to Canada. The test is whether an Applicant has adduced sufficient evidence of likely unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate, hardship to warrant the  
 exceptional 
  grant of Ministerial discretion that is contemplated by section 25 of the IRPA.
