  At the time the decision under review was made, the provisions of Guideline IP 5 dealing with persons in abusive relationships were set forth in section 13.10. Those provisions were subsequently moved to section 12.7. The language of the current section 12.7 is essentially the same as the language of the former section 13.10, although some of the factors that were listed in section 13.10 have been deleted. I will assess the Applicant's submission in terms of the guidelines as they stood at the time of the decision (the "Guidelines").
