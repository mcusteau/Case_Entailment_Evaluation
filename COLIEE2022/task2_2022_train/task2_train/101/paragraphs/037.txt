  The Applicant submits that the Officer's alleged "failure" to assess her situation in light of the Guidelines rendered the Officer's decision unreasonable. As discussed in section IV.B. above, the Officer did in fact assess the various factors set forth in the Guidelines that were relevant to the Applicant's situation. The fact that she did not explicitly state that she was doing so does not render her decision unreasonable. Given the evidence before the Officer, I am satisfied that the conclusions reached by the Officer in respect of those factors, particularly regarding the insufficiency of the Applicant's evidence, were reasonably available to the Officer. The Officer did not ignore any evidence that might reasonably have led her to reach a different conclusion.
