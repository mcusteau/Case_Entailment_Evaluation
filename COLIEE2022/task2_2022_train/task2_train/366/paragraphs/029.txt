The
Citizenship Regulations, 1993
neither envisage nor preclude the Minister's participation where the citizenship judge chooses to have the applicant for citizenship appear in person to provide additional in­formation. It is also worthy to note that, over the past twenty years, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration has rarely chosen to appeal the decision of the citizen­ship judge. Appeals on behalf of the Minister have become more frequent over the past year.
