On the 24th day of March, 1992, the Applicants were served with a "Call In Notice" to schedule travel arrangements for their return to Poland. During a meeting on the 7th day of April with Immigration Officer Bauly, the Applicants were advised that their removal was scheduled for the 22nd day of April, 1992. Officer Bauly refused to entertain at that meeting oral representations on behalf of the Applicant's with regard to humanitarian and compassionate considerations but did agree to consider written representations, thus opening for a third time the issue of consideration of an application for landing from within Canada. Apparently the date of April 22nd remained firm.
