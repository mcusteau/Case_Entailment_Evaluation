After examining this submission and counsel for the Respondent's submissions in reply, Cullen, J., concludes in the following terms at page 13:
"Even if I were to accept the applicant's position in terms of scope and redress on judicial review, my finding that there was no breach of the applicant's section 7 or 15
Charter
rights would not allow a further review. Therefore, my decision remains that there is no basis upon which to return this matter for a review."
