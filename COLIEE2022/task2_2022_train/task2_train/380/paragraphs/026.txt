I reach the same conclusion. I conclude that the evidence properly before me, that being the evidence that was before Officer Bauly, simply does not disclose a breach of the Applicant Rafal Lemiecha's s. 7 or 12
Charter
rights. There was, in my view, essentially no evidence before Officer Bauly, and therefore before me, regarding any link between conditions in Poland, environmental or otherwise, and Rafal Lemiecha's medical difficulties before he left Poland. There was no evidence regarding changes, if any, in conditions in Poland, environmental or otherwise, since the Lemiechas left Poland that might impact on Rafal Lemiecha's health if he returned to Poland. There was no evidence, only speculation or insinuation, that medical expertise, services and facilities in Poland are inferior to those in Canada, or so inferior as to result in a breach of Rafal Lemiecha's
Charter
rights if his health were to worsen on a return to Poland.
