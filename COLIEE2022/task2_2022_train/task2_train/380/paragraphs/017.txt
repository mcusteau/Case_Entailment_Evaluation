Three issues were ably argued before me at some length on behalf of the Applicants. Paraphrased from the Applicants' Application Record, they are the following:
"1. Did Officer Bauly, having undertaken a further humanitarian and compassionate grounds review, fail to comply with the duty to act fairly towards the Applicants in the conduct of that review.
"2. Did Officer Bauly exceed her jurisdiction in exercising her statutory power of decision making unreasonably on the evidence before her.
"3. Did Officer Bauly's decision violate the Applicant's rights under sections 7 and 12 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
to be free from cruel and unusual treatment and to security of the person."
