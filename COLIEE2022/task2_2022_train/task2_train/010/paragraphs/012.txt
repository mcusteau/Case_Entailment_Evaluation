  According to Mr. Provost, had he been given the opportunity he would have raised the following concerns: 
 
 
 
 a) The high-voltage overhead transmission line (HVOTL) project will be much larger in scale than the existing transmission line that runs across the Reserve; 
 
 
 
 b) Use of the existing right-of-way (ROW) where the other transmission line is located and information about what will happen to the old transmission line. The HVOTL project does not follow the existing transmission line ROW which results in the creation of a large utility corridor and the taking up of additional Reserve land; 
 
 
 
 c) The HVOTL project will significantly increase the voltage of electricity transmission beyond that of the existing transmission line; 
 
 
 
 d) The health effects on his family and himself from exposure to the electromagnetic fields (EMF) emitted by the HVOTL project and the existing transmission line; 
 
 
 
 e) The health effects on other Piikani members; 
 
 
 
 f) Whether the routing of the HVOTL project near his Residence and others on Reserve is appropriate given that there are a number of young children in homes and attending the Reserve school; 
 
 
 
 g) The location of the HVOTL project and the new ROW; 
 
 
 
 h) The stability and safety of the HVOTL structure itself; 
 
 
 
 i) The loss of use and enjoyment of his Residence, particularly, the view therefrom which will be obstructed by the project; 
 
 
 
 j) There is a serious housing shortage on the Reserve which makes it extremely difficult for him to find a new residence and he may not be able to relocate even if he wanted or needed to as a result of the ROW and the proposed HVOTL project. It is important to him that he continue to be able to reside in his Residence for several reasons: 
 
 
 
 (i) The location of the Residence allows him to live within close proximity to his family members, which is important to him; 
 
 
 
 (ii) He enjoys the Residence and its location generally, and does not want to leave; and 
 
 
 
 (iii) Over the course of the last twenty (20) years, he and his family have invested significant time and money into improving and maintaining the Residence. 
 
 
 
 k) There was no participation of the broader membership of the Piikani nation in a discussion of whether the HVOTL project is in the best interests of members of the Piikani nation and whether the land should be used for this purpose; and 
 
 
 
 l) Any additional comments he may have following a review of the HVOTL project.
