  The applications give rise to the following issues: 
 
 
 
 a) Was the Minister under a legal duty to consult with Mr. Provost before issuing the permit? If so, was that duty satisfied? 
 
 
 
 b) Is the band council resolution a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal subject to judicial review by this Court? 
 
 
 
 c) Was the Band Council under a legal duty to consult with Mr. Provost before passing the resolution? If so, was that duty satisfied? 
 
 
 
 d) Does Mr. Provost have standing to make these applications? The normal rule is that only persons "directly affected" have standing. If Mr. Provost was not directly affected, should he be given public interest standing? 
 
 
 
 e) Were the applications filed within time? The normal delay is 30 days which begins to run from the date the decision was first communicated to the applicant. If not, should the Court, in its discretion, extend the delays? 
 
 
 
 f) In any event, should the Court, in its discretion, refuse to grant the relief sought by Mr. Provost considering the delays and that the respondents had begun to act on the permit before the applications for judicial review were filed?
