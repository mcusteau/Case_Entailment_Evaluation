On or about November 5, 1982, Capt. Rasmussen, aboard the fishing vessel, was engaged in fishing operations in the Labrador Sea. The vessel had been observed a few days earlier, on November 1, from a Canadian Armed Forces patrol aircraft which reported some positional co-ordinates to the defendants' servants and officials in St. John's. As a result, the fisheries patrol vessel "Terra Nova" went haring out of St. John's and fisheries officers arrested the "Bordoyarnes" by boarding her and ordering Capt. Rasmussen to proceed to St. John's. He complied. On November 9, 1982, an information was sworn by a fisheries officer in the Provincial Court of Newfoundland, exhibit 3, charging that Capt. Rasmussen:
"Did on or about the 5th day of November, A.D. 1982, while being aboard a foreign vessel in Canadian waters, fish without authorization contrary to section 3(2)(a) of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act ..., thereby committing an offence contrary to section 8(1)(a) of the said Act."
