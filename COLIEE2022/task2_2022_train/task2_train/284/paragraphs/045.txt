The second reason gives point and purpose to the first. It is that the proceeds being possibly inadequate to compensate the person entitled thereto for the loss, possibly little more than the product of a virtual giveaway (as in the McRae case, supra), the person affected could be unjustly inflicted with a great loss or just some loss, if he or she had to accept whatever "proceeds" were paid over, without recourse to full compensation. Without precise and apt language to effect such an unjust prospect in the legislation, Parliament cannot be understood to have intended to wreak such injustice on persons whose goods have been taken. Indeed, in light of s. 1(a) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, R.S.C. 1970, Appendix III, one must construe s. 6(9) of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act so as to accord to the plaintiff Rasmussen at least, "the right ... to ... enjoyment of property, and the right not to be deprived thereof, except by due process of law". The tort of conversion of property is precisely the wrongful deprivation of a person's enjoyment of property, and conversion by sale exacts the remedy of full, fair compensation for the property which can no longer be traced and restored. When the state converts property by sale pursuant to legislation it is no longer a purely private matter and the Bill of Rights is engaged. There is no declaratory Act of Parliament to the effect that s. 6(9) of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act shall operate notwithstanding the Canadian Bill of Rights, as provided in s. 2 thereof.
