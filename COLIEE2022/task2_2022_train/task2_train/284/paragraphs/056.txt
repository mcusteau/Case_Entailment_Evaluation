[56]
The plaintiffs' counsel made a remarkable written submission after the trial, as follows:
"From the plaintiffs' perspective, the plaintiffs have been deprived of the use of this money and general damages, that is damages which are presumed by the law as the natural consequence of an action, have resulted therefrom. The plaintiffs request leave to amend the statement of claim to claim these
special
damages."
The sense of the request does not leap directly from the page here. As earlier indicated, no evidence was tendered to support the quantification or consequent award of general damages herein. Also, as indicated earlier herein, the court is indeed awarding special damages in the amount of $92,463.82 to the plaintiffs. No leave will be given to amend the statement of claim as requested.
