Paragraph 7 of the statement of claim asserts that:
"On or about the 10th day of November, 1982, before election, plea, or trial, representatives of the ... defendants advised ... [Capt.] Rasmussen, that they intended to offload 70 tonnes of saltfish from the 'Bordoyarnes' commencing Friday, November 12, 1982, and that the saltfish would be sold. [Capt.] Rasmussen was advised that a bond was not acceptable to the Canadian Fisheries Officials of the ... defendants. [Capt.] Rasmussen was further advised by the ... [said] officials that the saltfish could not be sold to Captain Rasmussen in order to avoid offloading on the grounds that offloading of the saltfish was a deterrence to other fishing vessels. The Canadian Fisheries officials further rejected offloading just 30-40 tonnes of saltfish."
By paragraph 4 of the statement of defence, the defendants admit all of the foregoing, but add that the defendants' servants "at that time understood that there were legal impediments to accepting a bond".
