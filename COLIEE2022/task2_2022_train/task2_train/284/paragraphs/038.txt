In exhibit 11 there are shown actual prices received by the Corporation on invoices dated between November 1, 1982 and January 31, 1983. This surely is the best evidence of market prices obtained for "wetsalted codfish" at various ports in Newfoundland, taken on Portuguese vessels, at the material times. The prices written in red ink on those invoices comprising exhibit 11, were placed there by Mr. Wheeler of the Saltfish Corporation. The fish taken from the "Bordoyarnes" was, in the state it was offloaded, "wetsalted cod" of the kind shown in exhibit 11. According to the inspection report, exhibit 12, confirmed by the inspection officer, Ralph Randell, who testified, the load of the plaintiffs' fish was graded as 12% choice quality and 88% standard quality. These totals diverge from the 18,584 lbs. of choice quality and the 135,216 lbs. of standard quality reported in exhibit 10, the Canadian Saltfish Corporation's account with the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation. However, since exhibit 10 reports the sizes in specific detail, it is accepted as the best evidence upon which calculations can be made.
