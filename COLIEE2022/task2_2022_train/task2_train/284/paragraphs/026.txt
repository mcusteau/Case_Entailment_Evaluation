Of course, the Crown is liable in tort for damages in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the Crown, as Parliament provided in s. 3(1)(a) of the Crown Liability Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-38, and amendments. Section 3(1)(b) of that Act also provides that the Crown is liable in tort "in respect of a breach of duty attaching to the ownership, ... possession or control of property", which surely makes one wonder why the Appeal Division held that the tort of conversion of property arises only out of the provincial law, but even so, Parliament has enacted that the Crown shall be liable for it. "Tort" is defined in the Act, as being, in respect of matters arising in Qu√©bec, delict or quasi-delict, showing that provincial law was in the legislator's mind. Section 4(4) of the Crown Liability Act does not purport to absolve the Crown of the liability fixed by s. 3 of that Act, but it does provide that "no proceedings lie against the Crown by virtue of s. 3(1)(b), unless, within seven days after the claim arose, notice in writing of the claim and of the injury complained of" be served on certain servants and officers of the Crown always including the Deputy Attorney General of Canada. The defendants do not deny the service of such notice in their statement of defence; nor do the plaintiffs assert compliance with s. 4(4) in their pleadings. No evidence was tendered either to show such compliance or to negative it. In such circumstances, where the law is clear and no statutory flaw is demonstrated whereby the plaintiffs were, or could be, obstructed from compliance, the maxim omnia praesumuntur rite et solemnitur esse acta does not apply. It was not argued.
