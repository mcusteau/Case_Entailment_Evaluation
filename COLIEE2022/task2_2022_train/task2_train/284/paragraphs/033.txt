If the fish had not been seized, the "Bordoyarnes" would have returned to its home port in the Faroes with the 70 tonnes well salted and in marketable condition. (According to the witness Lawrence Wilfred Penney the quantity of some 70 tonnes was determined from the plaintiffs' log as the approximate weight of the catch after October 15, 1982, the date on which a departmental observer was last aboard the vessel, until November 5, when she was apprehended. Such reasoning seems to imply that Capt. Rasmussen, in the defendants' view, began fishing illegally as soon as the inspector's back was turned, with no time even to proceed to the allegedly forbidden waters.) There is nothing before the court to suggest that the plaintiffs would not have realized their proper and full price for their catch, including the 70 tonnes, had no seizure been effected.
