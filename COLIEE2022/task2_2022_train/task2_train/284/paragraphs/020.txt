Those admissions, when regarded in the light of the reasons rendered by Mr. Justice Craig for a unanimous panel of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Re Milton et al. and The Queen (1987), 32 C.C.C.(3d) 159, dispose of the allegation of violation of s. 8 of the Charter. The factual circumstances of that case were quite different from those of the case at bar, and yet the legal considerations are closely analogous. There, the petitioners' fishing nets had been seized by fisheries officers pursuant to s. 58(1) of the Fisheries Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. F-14, even though the petitioners were not charged with any offence as a result of the seizure of their nets. By operation of s. 58(6) of that Act, the nets were forfeited subject to the disposition of an application to a judge of the county or district court under s. 59 of the Act.
