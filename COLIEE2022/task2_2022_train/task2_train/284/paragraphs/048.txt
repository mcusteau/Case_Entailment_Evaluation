Special damages have been assessed above. The plaintiffs also claimed general damages but no evidence was led in support of this claim. It may have been an inconvenience to the master and crew of the "Bordoyarnes" to continue their fishing operations in the shorter daylight of November in the Labrador Sea, in order to return home with a full hold, but such can hardly be quantified into an award of general damages without some supporting evidence. No doubt extra costs for food fuel and salt were incurred, and might have been included in special damages, if quantified. There will, therefore, be no award of general damages.
