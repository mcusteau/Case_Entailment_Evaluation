The plaintiffs' cause of action could therefore not arise before the Crown abandoned its appeal (exhibit 7) on March 22, 1984. The plaintiffs concede to the defendants some days, if not weeks, of grace within which to decide how much had to be paid and to requisition payment by cheque. There is no evidence before the court of any definitive assertion by the defendants of their refusal to pay the full value of the plaintiffs' fish. However, the date upon which the plaintiffs' solicitors received the defendants' cheque for $51,394.57 (exhibit 8) was May 25, 1984. This sum, the defendants plead, is full and final payment to the plaintiffs and therefore the date of its reception by them is the date when the defendants committed the tort of wrongful conversion by sale of the plaintiffs' fish. The plaintiffs' cause of action arose then on May 26, 1984. That is
after
the coming into force of the Judgment Interest Act which accordingly applies in the instant case.
