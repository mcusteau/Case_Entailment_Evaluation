As a member of the party he was involved in the 1988 electoral campaign, organizing meetings in his village and working as a returning officer for the elections. The candidate of the rival political party, the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (I.J.I.), approached him during the electoral campaign asking him to join his party, but the applicant refused. The P.P.P. subsequently won the elections nationally but the leader of the I.J.I. became Premier of the State of Punjab, at the provincial level.
