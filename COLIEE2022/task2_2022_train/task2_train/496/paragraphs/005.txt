On December 21, 1991, when the applicant and his cousin were on their way to a meeting about local elections, their car was chased by I.J.I. party thugs, who killed his cousin. Once again the police refused to conduct an investigation. The applicant therefore organized a demonstration on February 8, 1992, which was broken up by the police. The applicant thereupon fled the scene. However, he continued his political activities, including participating in a demonstration in November 1992. This time the bus taking the applicant to the demonstration was attacked and the driver killed. Following this last occurrence the applicant's family received death threats. The applicant then decided to leave Pakistan on December 20, 1992, and arrived in Canada on December 31, 1992.
