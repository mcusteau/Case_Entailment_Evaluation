First of all, in applying this standard of review to the impugned decision, I cannot find that the Board made an unreasonable decision in ruling that there is no nexus between the male applicant's fear of losing his life at the hands of two officers, Rivas and Guevara, whom he discovered were trafficking drugs in the army, and the ground of political opinion. The evidence does not provide any indication that the male applicant's actions, reporting that two officers were trafficking drugs, had a political basis or could have been perceived as such by the persecutors.
