No such specific findings were made in this case. Procedural fairness requires that specific findings be made regarding crimes the Board feels have been committed by a claimant. In my view, the Board limited itself to drawing inferences without clearly establishing the crimes the male applicant participated in. It simply laid responsibility on him for crimes committed by the Peruvian army, that is, acts of torture and abuses against the civilian population, based on documentary evidence on Peru. The Board did not establish the male applicant's complicity in the perpetration of these acts. Since it found the male applicant was not credible, the Board concluded that he had been involved in the commission of broadly defined crimes. The Court cannot uphold this conclusion. Since this omission is an error of law, I find that the Board's decision is incorrect and that intervention is warranted in this case with respect to the finding of the male applicant's exclusion.
2. Did the Board err in deciding that there was no nexus between the applicants' fear and the grounds in the definition of Convention refugee under section 96 of the Act, that is, political opinion and membership in a particular social group, namely, the family?
