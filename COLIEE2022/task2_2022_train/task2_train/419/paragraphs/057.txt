I feel that the Board's finding regarding the male applicant's exclusion from application of the Convention is erroneous and must be set aside. I do believe, however, that there is no basis for intervention in judicial review with respect to the Board's finding on the application of section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the
Act
in this case. The application for judicial review is therefore dismissed.
