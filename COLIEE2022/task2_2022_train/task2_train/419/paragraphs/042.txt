According to the Supreme Court of Canada in Dr. Q., supra, at paragraph 34, the standard to be applied to questions of mixed fact and law largely depends on the question, i.e., whether it is more of a factual nature or of a legal nature.
"When the finding being reviewed is one of pure fact, this factor will militate in favour of showing more deference towards the tribunal's decision. Conversely, an issue of pure law counsels in favour of a more searching review. This is particularly so where the decision will be one of general importance or great precedential value:
Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, 2002 SCC 3, at para. 23. Finally, with respect to questions of mixed fact and law, this factor will call for more deference if the question is fact-intensive, and less deference if it is law-intensive."
