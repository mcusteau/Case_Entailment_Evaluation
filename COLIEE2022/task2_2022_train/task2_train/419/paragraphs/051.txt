The Board found the following elements of the applicants' testimony to be implausible:
- That the male applicant could not explain why the original copy of his report and discharge papers were not entered into evidence, whereas they were at his mother's home;
- That their persecutors waited four months to order them not to disclose the report;
- That the male applicant is still a threat to the army even though he is no longer a member;
- That they claim they lived in hiding, whereas the male applicant openly worked as a pilot;
- That the male applicant allegedly never spoke about his problems with his wife;
- That they waited until June 17, 2002, to leave Peru, whereas the male applicant's US visa had been ready since August 24, 2001, and his wife's since November 9, 2001;
- That the male applicant did not lodge a complaint with the police after he was tortured by individuals he says he recognized, whereas the female applicant reported the threats she received to the police;
- That the applicants left their country two weeks after the female applicant lodged a complaint with the police, without waiting for the results of the investigation.
