In my view, the Board found, without providing sufficient reasons, that the male applicant was responsible for perpetrating the acts listed in paragraphs (a) and (c) of section 1F of the Convention simply because he had been a member of the Peruvian army, which, according to documentation on current conditions in Peru, has members that have committed these acts. My review of the entire record leads me to conclude that the Board did not consider whether it had been proven that the male applicant personally and knowingly participated in the perpetration of these crimes.
