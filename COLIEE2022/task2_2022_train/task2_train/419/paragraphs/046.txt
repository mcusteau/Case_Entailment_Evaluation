To base a claim on this ground, the persecution the male applicant fears must stem from his political opinion as manifested by his act:
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321; 103 D.L.R.(4th) 1. The evidence in the record does not indicate that the male applicant's political convictions have been established by his act of reporting the drug trafficking operation. The evidence also does not lead me to find that the persecutors, the two officers, could have ascribed a political opinion to him. Essentially, the evidence in the record indicates that the male applicant acted within the boundaries of his duties in the army. It does not show that his actions were based on his political beliefs.
