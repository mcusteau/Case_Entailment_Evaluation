  In my view, there should be some - but not complete - discount of the costs of this phase. As I understand it, Apotex advised the prothonotary hearing the bifurcation motion that the remedies phase would likely take two or three days of trial time. This fact weighs in favour of reducing the costs for the second phase. However, I do not think Apotex was, in any way, attempting to mislead the Court. It was only after considerable work had been carried out that the true extent of the issues became apparent. As the reality became clear, the Plaintiffs could have brought a further motion or a motion for reconsideration. That did not happen. Further, Sanofi contributed to the length of this phase of the trial by not making an election between damages and profits until the commencement of the presentation of oral arguments. Finally, I believe that the pre-trial discovery and expert reports were, more likely than not, helpful to the parties for settlement discussions.
