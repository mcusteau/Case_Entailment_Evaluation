  I expect that the parties will now be able to calculate and agree on a quantum for the award. I will remain seized of this matter. I would be prepared to make a further order awarding a lump sum, if Apotex wished to prepare an order for my consideration calculating the amounts of the costs to which it is entitled. Specific questions or further disagreements may be brought to me. However, only in exceptional circumstances will any award of costs be made for further steps in finalizing the quantum of the award.
