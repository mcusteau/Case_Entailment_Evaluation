  The Plaintiffs (Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. and Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, referred to collectively as Sanofi, and Schering Corporation, referred to as Schering) were unsuccessful in this action. This Court declared that certain claims of Canadian Patent No. 1,341,206 ('206 Patent) were invalid. Sanofi argues that success was divided and that I should reduce the award by 50% on the basis of the lack of success of Apotex on some of the issues dealt with by the Court. I do not agree.
