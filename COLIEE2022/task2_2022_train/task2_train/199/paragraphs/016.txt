 [16] 
  In respect of pre-trial matters, Apotex should be allowed to recover fees and reasonable disbursements (including travel, accommodation and related expenses) for all pre-trial procedures (Items 1 to 12, 16 to 22 and 24 of Tariff B). This would include attendance at the testing in relation to Example 20 of the '206 Patent. However, except in the limited circumstances set out in the following, the request for recovery for more than one first and one second counsel is refused. For further guidance, the award should include the costs for one first and one second counsel (where in attendance) in respect of: 
 
 
 
 • preparation of pleadings; 
 
 
 
 • preparation of motion materials and attendance at motion hearings (other than those where costs were specifically directed or awarded to the Plaintiffs); 
 
 
 
 • documentary and oral discovery (including reasonable time spent traveling to attend discovery out of the normal place of residence of those attending); 
 
 
 
 • preparation of expert affidavits for those experts who appeared at trial; preparation of witnesses who appeared at trial; 
 
 
 
 • and preparation and attendance at pre-trial conferences.
