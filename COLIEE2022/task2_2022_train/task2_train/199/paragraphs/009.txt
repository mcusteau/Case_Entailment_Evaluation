  The decision of this Court in ADIR v. Apotex, 2008 FC 1070, 70 C.P.R. (4th) 347 (referred to as ADIR Costs) is an example of where success was truly divided. While the Plaintiffs succeeded in having their patent upheld and obtaining an injunction against the Defendants (see Servier v. Apotex, 2008 FC 825, 332 F.T.R 193, aff'd by Apotex v. ADIR, 2009 FCA 222, 75 C.P.R. (4th) 443), they failed to obtain standing for two of the originally-named Plaintiffs. They were also unsuccessful in obtaining a finding of inducement. These two failures went directly to the remedies sought by the Plaintiffs. This, in my view, was "divided success". In the decision on costs, I reduced the overall award by 10% to account for the divided success.
