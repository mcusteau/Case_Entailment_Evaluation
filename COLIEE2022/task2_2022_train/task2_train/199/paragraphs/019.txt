  Apotex seeks recovery of costs for services of students-at-law, law clerks and consulting scientists. Related to this, Apotex seeks recovery of the costs of Summation technology and of computerized research services. In my view, all of these expenses were part of the normal overhead costs of litigation. I am not prepared to award costs for any of these expenses.
