  The Plaintiffs submit that any award of costs should be discounted in respect of evidence of the former Warner-Lambert scientists. The culmination of this evidence was a motion by Apotex before this Court for admission of certain evidence. That motion was rejected, with costs to the Plaintiffs. Accordingly, I am satisfied that costs related to the Warner-Lambert evidence will be accounted for without the need for reduction.
