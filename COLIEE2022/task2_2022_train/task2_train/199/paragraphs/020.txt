  Under Rule 400 (1)(e), a factor that the Court may consider is a written offer to settle. In addition, pursuant to Rule 420, there are serious cost consequences where a written offer to settle is made and judgment is made in favour of the party who makes the offer to settle. Not all settlement offers will meet the stringent requirements of Rule 420. Nevertheless, a written offer to settle that does not meet the requirements of Rule 420 may still be factored into an award of costs under Rule 400 (Dimplex North America Ltd. v. CFM Corp., 2006 FC 1403, 55 C.P.R. (4th) 202, at para. 20).
