 Snider, J. 
 : These reasons relate to the matter of costs arising from the patent infringement action, for which Reasons for Judgment and Judgment were released to the parties on June 29, 2009 (Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. v. Apotex Inc., 2009 FC 676). The trial of this matter was held together 
 
 
 
 with an action commenced by the same Plaintiffs, in respect of the same patent, against Novopharm Limited (Docket: T-1161-07). At that time, the parties were provided with an opportunity to make submissions on costs, if they could not agree amongst themselves. They did not agree and submissions and reply submissions on costs were served and filed. Having reviewed the submissions, I now wish to provide my decision and reasons on the issue of costs in this matter.
