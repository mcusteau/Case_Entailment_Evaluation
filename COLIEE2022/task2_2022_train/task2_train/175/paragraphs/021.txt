  A final consideration in these Reasons must concern the decision by which the application for leave was refused, the decision set out in paragraph 5 of these Reasons. Counsel for the respondent, the Attorney General of Canada, urged that the decision, in particular the portion stating "I see no error in principle on the part of the Tribunal. I do not see a proper foundation for granting leave to appeal", makes clear that the designated member was properly considering whether the application for leave had raised an arguable case, without considering the merits of the application. That line may be difficult to draw in a given case, I acknowledge, but I am persuaded that in this case the leave application was assessed by the proper test, i.e., whether it raised an arguable case, without considering the merits of the application.
