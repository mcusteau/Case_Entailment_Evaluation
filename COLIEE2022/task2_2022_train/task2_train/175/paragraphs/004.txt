  Mr. Callihoo's application for disability benefits under the  
 Act 
  was denied. He appealed that decision, in accord with the  
 Act 
 , to the Minister, and then to a Review Tribunal pursuant to s. 82 of the  
 Plan 
 . The Tribunal's decision, dated October 29, 1997, found there was insufficient medical evidence that his injuries resulted in the applicant being so severely disabled as required by the  
 Act 
  to qualify for benefits. Under the  
 Plan 
  subs. 42(2) provides: 
 
 
 
 "(2) For the purposes of this Act, 
 
 
 
 (a) a person shall be considered to be disabled only if he is determined in prescribed manner to have a severe and prolonged mental or physical disability, and for the purposes of this paragraph, 
 
 
 
 (i) a disability is severe only if by reason thereof the person in respect of whom the determination is made is incapable regularly of pursuing any substantially gainful occupation, and 
 
 
 
 (ii) a disability is prolonged only if it is determined in prescribed manner that the disability is likely to be long continued and of indefinite duration or is likely to result in death; and 
 
 
 
 (b) a person shall be deemed to have become or to have ceased to be disabled at such time as is determined in the prescribed manner to be the time when the person became or ceased to be, as the case may be, disabled, but in no case shall a person be deemed to have become disabled earlier than fifteen months before the time of the making of any application in respect of which the determination is made."
