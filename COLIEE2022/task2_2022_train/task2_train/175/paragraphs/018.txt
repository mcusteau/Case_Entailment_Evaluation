  I have myself checked the  
 Alberta Regulation 203/99, Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped 
 , made pursuant to the Alberta statute with the same title. The plan there sets out provision of a monthly payment of benefits determinable under the regulations for one who has a "severe handicap", a term defined as follows: 
 
 
 
 "(c) 'severe handicap' means an impairment of mental or physical functioning or both that, in the opinion of the Director after considering any relevant medical or psychological reports, causes substantial limitation in the person's ability to earn a livelihood and is likely to continue to affect that person permanently because no remedial therapy is available that would materially improve the person's ability to earn a livelihood or improve the person's mental or physical functioning;" [see footnote 14] 
 
 
 
 There are concepts in this definition somewhat similar to those in subs. 42(2) of the Plan, but there are differences as well. Moreover, it does not simply follow that qualification for a benefit provided under the provincial legislation raises an arguable issue concerning a decision that similar evidence does not qualify for benefit under another statute, in this case the  
 Canada Pension Plan 
 .
