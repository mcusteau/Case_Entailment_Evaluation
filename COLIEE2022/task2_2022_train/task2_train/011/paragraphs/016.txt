  As a preliminary issue, the Respondent argues that only the evidence that was before the decision-maker should be considered in this application. In particular, information contained in paragraph 2 of the Applicant's Affidavit, which describes the Applicant's shareholders and lists its shareholders, officers and directors, was not before the CRA Officer. It is well accepted that only the information that was before the decision-maker can be considered by a reviewing court on judicial review. I therefore accept the Respondent's argument and will disregard the information contained in paragraph 2 of the Applicant's affidavit. I note, however, that the CRA Officer did review materials from Mr.Brian Boulton indicating that he had incorporated the Applicant and which suggest that he was a director of the Applicant.
