  The error, which is acknowledged by the Applicant and Mr. Boulton, is not the result of circumstances beyond their control. Nor does the evidence support a finding that the error arose by reason of actions of the Department. Further, there is no evidence of hardship let alone undue hardship or extraordinary circumstances that may have prevented the Applicant from making the payments when due, or otherwise complying with the ITA. Ignorance of the legislative requirements or third party error do not constitute extraordinary circumstances which would warrant granting the request for relief as described in the Respondent's policy guidelines.
