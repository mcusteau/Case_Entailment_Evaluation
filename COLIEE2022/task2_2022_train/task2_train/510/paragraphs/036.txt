The sixth test, set out in the
White Book
, is "to tie the hands of the party so that he cannot without leave go into any matters not included ...". This is peripherally related to pleadings in that the defendant should be able to understand the plaintiff's case and plead on point to it, thus assisting in limiting the matters which the parties then need to explore.
