  On March 18, 2005, the Plaintiff's counsel wrote to the CBSA advising that an unrelated drug prosecution against the Plaintiff had been stayed by the Crown. He also asked for an update on the status of the ministerial review. It was not until June 27, 2005, that the ministerial review decision was rendered. That decision upheld the seizure action and forfeiture decision made by the border officer. It is from this ministerial review decision that the Plaintiff commenced this action by way of a Statement of Claim issued on September 6, 2005.
