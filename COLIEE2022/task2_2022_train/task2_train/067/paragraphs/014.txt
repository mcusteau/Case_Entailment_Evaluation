  Justice Lemieux's decision in  
 McMahon 
  was subsequently upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal, but that Court sanctioned the Superintendent's failure to comply with the provision by awarding costs to the unsuccessful party: see  
 McMahon v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [2005] F.C.J. No. 166; 332 N.R. 107; 2005 FCA 33, at paragraph 5.
