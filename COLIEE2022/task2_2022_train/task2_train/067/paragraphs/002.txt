  The Plaintiff's action stems from the seizure of United States currency by the Canadian Border Security Agency ("CBSA") at the Douglas Border Crossing on April 3, 2004. The amount of U.S. cash seized from the Plaintiff was $8,300, worth at the time, $10,956 in Canadian funds. These funds were seized because the Plaintiff failed to declare that she was in possession of a sum exceeding $10,000 as required by s. 12(1) of the  
 Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act 
 , 2000, c. 17, s. 1; 2001, c. 41, s. 48 (the " 
 Act 
 ").
