  Counsel for the Defendants also points out that a declaration that the ministerial decision is a nullity would not assist the Plaintiff because the monies seized are deemed by s. 23 of the  
 Act 
  to be forfeited to the Crown. Absent a successful appeal under the  
 Act 
  challenging the legality of the seizure on the merits, there is no other mechanism created to reverse the forfeiture on the basis of a subsequent procedural defect. In short, the forfeiture would remain in effect. The Plaintiff's argument that upon a declaration of a nullity this Court should simply order the return of the money could also lead to a situation where the proceeds of a crime were returned without there ever having been a s. 30 determination on the merits - all because a time limit was missed.
