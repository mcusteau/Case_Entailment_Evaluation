 [23] 
  In conclusion, I would allow the Defendant's motion for summary judgment and dismiss this action pursuant to rule 216(2)(b) of the  
 Federal Courts Rules 
 . This ruling is made, however, without prejudice to the Plaintiff's right to seek an extension of time to obtain leave to commence a judicial review proceeding to pursue the relief she has claimed in paragraph 18 of her Statement of Claim. Neither party requested costs and therefore no costs will be awarded.
