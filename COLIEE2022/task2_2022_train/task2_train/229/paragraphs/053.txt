In the context of the scheme of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, paragraph 113(a) make eminent sense since a panel of the Convention Refugee Determination Division that considers a Convention refugee claim is required also to consider whether or not the person is a person in need of protection. That was not the case when the Applicant in this matter had her Convention refugee claim considered. Thus, consideration of the Applicant's need of protection and the evidence of such need, while such evidence was before the CRDD, was not considered in that context by the CRDD but rather was considered by the PCDO who arrived at the decision here under review, a decision that I have determined to be flawed. While I am deeply cognizant of the fact that it is not my role to suggest to the Respondent that paragraph 113(a) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
should be ignored, I cannot help but comment that if it is applied in its strictest terms to the Applicant's pre-removal risk assessment, the result will be that the Applicant will in effect have received no valid and meaningful determination of whether she is a person in need of protection from a return to Ukraine.
