Before me, counsel for the respondent urged that, in light of the coming into force of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
which resulted in the elimination of the PDRCC class, no "live controversy" continues between the Applicant and the Respondent with respect to the decision under review because whether or not the Applicant might have been a member of PDRCC class is no longer relevant. Counsel urged that this was reinforced by evidence before me that the Respondent views the Applicant as entitled to a "Pre-Removal Risk Assessment" ("PRRA") under the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
which would essentially afford her a new opportunity to make her case as a person in need of protection. I adopt the Respondent's submissions in this regard, but that is not the end of the matter. I turn to the second element of what Justice Sopinka described as the "two-step analysis", that is, the question of whether or not the circumstances of this matter warrant considering this application for judicial review on its merits, notwithstanding its mootness.
