The Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board determined that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee. In its reasons for decision, the CRDD wrote:
"With regard to credibility, the panel found the claimant to be generally credible. Her testimony was reasonably consistent and straightforward. The report and testimony of Dr. Marc Nesca state that he believes that she has suffered a traumatic incident which has led to symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Dr. Nesca testified that during his two hour interview with the claimant he found her to be credible, as her reported symptoms were consistent with her behaviour. The panel accepts his diagnosis that she suffers from PTSD, likely triggered by a traumatic incident such as the rape she described.
"The panel further accepts that the claimant was threatened by individuals with whom she had been doing business, and that given the seriousness of their retribution against her, the harm she suffered does amount to persecution.
"However, the panel does not find there is a nexus between the persecution she suffered at the hands of Mr. Bulackh [the Applicant's collaborator] and his 'representatives' and any of the grounds enumerated in the Convention refugee definition." [see footnote 2]
