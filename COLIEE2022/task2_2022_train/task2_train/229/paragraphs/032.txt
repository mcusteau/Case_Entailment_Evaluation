While it is questionable whether there is an "adversarial relationship" between the Applicant and the Respondent in the circumstances of this matter, I am satisfied that that is not the issue. I am satisfied that the decision under review is a decision "... very damaging to the Applicant..." and that that decision is now part of the Applicant's record for immigration purposes. To the extent that it remains unreviewed, it is entirely possible that it might influence the thinking of an officer who undertakes a PRRA in respect of the Applicant. If the decision is not reviewed, and therefore is allowed to stand, there are at least potential "collateral [negative] consequences to the applicant".
