This judgment has frequently been criticised by a number of judges of the Trial Division and ways have been sought to evade the rigidity of it in view of the hopelessly inadequate amounts allowed in the Tariff but it has nevertheless been followed in the Court of Appeal in such cases as Consolboard Inc. v. McMillan Bloedel (Saskatchewan) Limited (1981), 37 N.R. 296; 58 C.P.R.(2d) 100. The defendant submits that the Manitoba Fisheries Ltd. v. Canada case, [1979] 1 F.C. 217; 35 N.R. 129, constitutes an exception to this. That was in the nature of a test case however which resulted on appeal in the reversal of the interpretation placed on the statute by several judges of the Trial Division of the court. The present case can hardly be considered as a test case however although it raised some issues for the first time of very serious legal questions, the action having been instituted before the judgments of Mr. Justice Strayer in the Royal Doulton and Interlego cases which were followed in the Trial Division in this case but subsequently reversed in appeal, with respect to the interpretation of the word "and" in regulation 11(1)(a) of the Industrial Design Act. The fact that an action involves the determination of a number of serious legal issues some of which may be novel however and which undoubtedly will affect many future cases does not I believe make it a test case such as the Manitoba Fisheries case. Many law suits involve serious and important legal issues requiring extensive study and preparation by counsel, but the Smerchanski judgment seems to preclude the possibility of the court exercising its discretion to award amounts beyond those allowed by the Tariff.
