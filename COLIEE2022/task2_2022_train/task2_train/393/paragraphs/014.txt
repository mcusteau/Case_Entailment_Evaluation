It is customary to allow reasonable payments to experts for services performed in preparing for and giving evidence pursuant to Tariff A, s. 4(2) and I would allow the taxation of the expert German which plaintiff does not contest. With respect to the expert Kirby however the situation is substantially different. In the judgment, I had this to say about his evidence:
"Peter Kirby, an experienced patent agent, also testified as an expert on behalf of defendant. He admitted however that his expertise is in the field of industrial design and much of what he said is inadmissible including opinions expressed in paragraphs 17 and following of his affidavit on the interpretation of s. 46 of the Copyright Act which is a legal matter. In paragraph 18 for example he sets out his views of the consequences of finding that copyright protection extends to shape and configuration of an article. He strongly critisizes the Royal Doulton case. These are all matters for argument by counsel not for evidence by an expert witness."
