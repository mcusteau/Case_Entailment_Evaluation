At the hearing of this application, counsel for the applicant relied heavily on Annex A of CFAO-15-7 which provides that a member must serve two months for each month of training, to a maximum of 60 months "commencing the date postgraduate training is completed". Counsel argues that there can be no doubt that the obligatory service for postgraduate training commences on the day that the postgraduate studies are completed. Thus, according to counsel, the first 50 months of service completed by the applicant were those months of service incurred in respect of his postgraduate studies and the outstanding months of service are those which he undertook to serve in consideration of his undergraduate training. The applicant therefore submits that the outstanding months of service, pursuant to FRP-96, are waived as he was an approved applicant.
