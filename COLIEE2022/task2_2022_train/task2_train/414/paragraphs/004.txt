In November 1995, the Department of National Defence announced a force reduction program ("FRP 96"). The purpose of this program was to reduce personnel levels so as to meet the operational needs of the Armed Forces. The applicant, with the rank of Captain in aerospace engineering, qualified for the program. Of relevance to these proceedings is the fact that the program allowed for the waiver of obligatory service incurred by reason of undergraduate training by Aerospace Engineers with the rank of Captain:
