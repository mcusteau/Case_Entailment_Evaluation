I cannot subscribe to the applicant's point of view. Firstly, a fair reading of CFAO-15-7, and in particular paragraph 13 thereof, can only lead to the conclusion that the applicant, like any other member of the Armed Forces who has received undergraduate and graduate funding, must serve the period of service required for each level of funding. According to paragraph 13 of CFAO-15-7, "where an additional period of obligatory service is incurred prior to a member completing a previously incurred period of service, the total obligatory service then in effect is the sum of the unexpired portion of the first period of service plus the second period of service". In this particular case, those periods are 60 and 50 months for a total of 110 months of obligatory service. Upon completion of his postgraduate course, the applicant was obliged to serve 110Â months in the Armed Forces "commencing the date postgraduate training is completed". In my view, the applicant had to start with month number one of the 110 months. At the time of his application for release, the applicant had completed the period of service undertaken in consideration of his undergraduate studies. The remaining months of service are those which he undertook to serve in respect of his postgraduate studies. Thus, at the relevant time, the period relating to the undergraduate degree could not be waived because it had been served.
