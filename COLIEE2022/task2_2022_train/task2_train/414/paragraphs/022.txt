After reviewing the circumstances of the case, Mr. Justice Stone concluded that:
"[i]t was open to the respondent [the member] to seek redress at the next step in the chain of command above Rear Admiral Johnston, namely to the Commander, Maritime Command, who, like Rear Admiral Johnston, was endowed with the same authority of redress if '...Â personally satisfied of the justice of the complaint'. It seems to me that the power to quash a C & P [Counselling and Probation] on the ground the process under which it was imposed was defective is vested in the Commander, Maritime Command, under subparagraph 10(a)(ii) to the same extent that it was vested in Rear Admiral Johnston."
