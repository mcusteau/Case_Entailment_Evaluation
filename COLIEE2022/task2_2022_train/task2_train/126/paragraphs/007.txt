 [7] 
  With the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in  
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9, it is settled that procedural fairness is to be reviewed on a correctness standard while the H&C decision is to be reviewed on a reasonableness standard. The reasonableness standard admits of a range of reasonable outcomes. The Court is aware that an H&C decision is discretionary, an exception to the normal rules. The officer, by virtue of familiarity and having interviewed the Applicant, was in an excellent position to assess the merits of the Applicant's story.
