  It is well established that an applicant has the burden of establishing her case. Generally, an applicant is to do that once, rather than on the basis of some sort of rolling story of reply, sur-reply and so forth. The Applicant had an interview at which all the relevant issues were canvassed. There is nothing unfair in the officer deciding the case on the evidence as provided by the Applicant at that time.
