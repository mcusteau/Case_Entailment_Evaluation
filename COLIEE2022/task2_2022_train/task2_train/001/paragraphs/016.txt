  The meaning of the term "serious issue" is derived from the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Metropolitan Stores (MTS) Ltd. v. Manitoba Food and Commercial Workers, Local 832 and Labour Board (Man.) 
 , [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110; 73 N.R. 341; 46 Man.R.(2d) 241 and  
 RJR-MacDonald Inc. et Imperial Tobacco Ltd. v. Canada (Procureur général) 
 , [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311; 164 N.R. 1; 60 Q.A.C. 241. In these two cases, the Supreme Court explained that the term "serious issue" means that the application is not frivolous or vexatious; therefore, the threshold is low and involves a preliminary assessment of the merits of the case. A prolonged examination of the merits is neither necessary nor desirable ( 
 RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. 
   
 Canada (Attorney General) 
 , above at pp. 335, 337-338). As the application is neither vexatious nor frivolous, the Court concludes that a serious issue has been raised and the second and third prongs of the tests are therefore considered below.
