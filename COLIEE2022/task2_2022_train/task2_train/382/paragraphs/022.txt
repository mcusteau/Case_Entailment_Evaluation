The Applicant made a further fairness request on June 23, 2003. After conducting an in-depth review of her financial situation, Stefan Linke, Collections Officer with the Collections Section of the Vancouver Tax Services Office of Canada customs and Revenue Agency, prepared a recommendation for the Director of Collection's office recommending that the fairness application be denied because financial hardship had not been established and the Applicant had a prior history of non-compliance with the Income Tax Act ("Act").
