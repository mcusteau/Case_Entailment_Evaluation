The Committee, by letter dated April 3, 2003, from Mr. Robert Allen, the Manager of the Revenue Collections Section of the Vancouver Tax Services of the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency, did not accept the recommendation of Ms. Fitzsimmons concerning interest and denied the Applicant's request for relief on the grounds that the case for financial hardship had not been made out.
