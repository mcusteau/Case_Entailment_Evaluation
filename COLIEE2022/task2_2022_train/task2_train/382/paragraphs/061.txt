I find no basis for the Applicant's arguments that material facts were overlooked or that the decision process was sullied and not fair. She is the author of her problems. The Ministerial discretion was appropriately exercised in this case. Given the background, both decisions were entirely reasonable and certainly cannot be described as patently unreasonable.
