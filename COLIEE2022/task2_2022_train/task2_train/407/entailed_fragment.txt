I am of the view that the proper interpretation of subsection 16(7) of the
YOA
is that when an order is made transferring charges from youth court to ordinary court, the applicant is not being tried for offences under the
YOA
, as that term is used in the exception contained in subsection 36(3)(e) of
IRPA
. The convictions against the applicant in this case are convictions for indictable offences under the
Criminal Code
in ordinary court, and are not related to offences under the
YOA
. For this reason the exception in
IRPA
is not applicable.
