As a result of this interpretation, counsel for the applicant argued before the tribunal, in the particular circumstances of this case, the application of paragraph 5(2)(g) of the former
Regulations
was not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter
because its application would leave the applicant permanently without access to his wife. Counsel argued the tribunal could fashion a
Charter
remedy under s. 24 of the
Charter
to cure this
Charter
breach by ordering what the applicant says he suggested but had been refused by Ontario - monthly payments of $500.00 and allowing his sponsorship of his wife to proceed forthwith.
