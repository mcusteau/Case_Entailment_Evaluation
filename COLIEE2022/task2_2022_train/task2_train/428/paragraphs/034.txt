Before closing on the subject of the standard of review, I mention the Supreme Court of Canada's recent decision in
Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84; 280 N.R. 268, which involved a review of an Immigration Appeal Division discretionary decision exercised under s. 70(1) of the former
Act
on the removal of a permanent resident where the tribunal "having regard to all of the circumstances of the case" could determine that person should not be removed from Canada by staying the removal order.
