It would be an appropriate consideration for the tribunal re-hearing the matter to receive evidence on Mr. Aryan's efforts to enter into a satisfactory agreement with Ontario on the repayment of the debt arising from his first undertaking. I do not think paragraph 5(2)(g) of the former
Regulations
precludes that kind of arrangement.
