I note that
Suresh
,
Baker
,
Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982; 226 N.R. 201, and this case are all cases involving decisions under the
Immigration Act
. In the cases decided by the Supreme Court of Canada, that Court analysed the four factors going into the makeup of the appropriate standard of review. In the circumstances, it is superfluous for me to engage in a similar analysis; it is thus appropriate simply to acknowledge the standard of review in respect of different aspects of the tribunal's decision which relate to the Court's power under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
.
