After this finding, the tribunal reached the following conclusion:
"
Balanced against these positive compassionate and humanitarian factors is the extent of the default under the appellant's undertaking given to sponsor his parents to Canada. The undertaking is one cornerstone of a sponsorship application. The extent of the default in this case is large.
However, the appellant was in the expensive process of upgrading his educational and employment skills during the five-year period of his undertaking.
It is difficult to see how the appellant could have supported his parents without government assistance and improved his education and future employment prospects at the same time. I find that the appellant is in a financial position to make $500 monthly payments towards the default. The evidence presented indicates that he is being asked for payment in full. I am not persuaded on a balance of probabilities that the appellant is able at this time to pay off the entire amount owing.
At the same time he is now 40 years old and has already delayed marrying and starting a family for a considerable period of time. (emphasis mine)
"Further emotional hardship is entailed in delaying the sponsorship application pending payment in full. On the other hand, I find that allowing the sponsorship application to proceed without payment of the amount in default, will likely result in the non-payment of any of the $60,000 owing under the prior undertaking."
