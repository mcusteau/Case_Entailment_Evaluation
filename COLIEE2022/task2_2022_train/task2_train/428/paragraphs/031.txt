I hasten to observe that the Supreme Court of Canada's formulation in
Suresh
, supra, of the content of patent unreasonableness identifying the grounds it enumerated warranting interference with the Minister's discretionary decision is remarkably close to the traditional administrative law grounds warranting the setting aside of a discretionary decision as expressed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Canada et al.
, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2; 44 N.R. 354, grounds representing an error of law under s. 18.1(4)(c) of the
Federal Court Act
. In
Maple Lodge Farms
, supra, Justice McIntyre, on behalf of the Court, stated the following at page 7 concerning the Court's role in the exercise of statutory discretion:
"... It is, as well, a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. Where the statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith and, where required, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the courts should not interfere. ..."
