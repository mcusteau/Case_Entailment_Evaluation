I see the following errors underlying this conclusion:
1. The evidence does not support the tribunal's finding Mr. Aryan did not discuss with officials in Ontario a monthly payment schedule. Mr. Aryan's testimony is clear he approached Ontario twice, once in 2001 and another time in 2002 suggesting to appropriate officials a schedule of payment but those officials were not interested, demanding payment in full (transcript, certified record, page 238, 239 and 295.
2. The tribunal ignored his evidence he intended to pay back to Ontario what his parents received (transcript, certified record, p. 283).
3. The tribunal, as suggested by counsel for the Minister before it, seemed to minimize his efforts to obtain a bank loan in the amount of $60,000 to pay of the social assistance his parents received yet later in its reasons found on the balance of probabilities he "was unable at this time to pay off the entire amount owing" which contradicts its earlier suggestion.
4. The tribunal's finding Mr. Aryan was reluctant to acknowledge his financial obligations to Canada and Ontario stems from misreading the evidence. Mr. Aryan testified he was never under the impression of defaulting because, at his doctor's suggestion, he, with his parents, approached Ontario. According to his evidence, not challenged by the tribunal, he told Ontario officials of his sponsorship undertaking and his continued desire to help. Ontario agreed he could afford to contribute $200 a month (he was earning $1,200 a month). Ontario deducted $200 a month from their disability entitlement, which was his agreed to contribution. Those deductions continued until 2001 after the end of his undertaking to Canada in 1998.
