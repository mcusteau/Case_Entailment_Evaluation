The applicant says he would not know that he must make an application to request s. 11(3) consideration until he is told his application fails under the units of assessment determination, and this is a reason for a personal interview. However, this argument is misplaced. The visa officer is not required to provide a piecemeal ongoing determination and advise the applicant at each stage, even if a personal interview is conducted. The units of assessment award is the conventional way in which visa officers determine whether an immigrant visa may be issued. Section 11(3) is exceptional. Where an applicant has reason to believe that he or she may be successfully established in Canada, irrespective of the units of assessment determination, he or she should apply for a determination under s. 11(3) setting forth relevant reasons. Otherwise, while the visa officer may do so on his or her own volition, there is no obligation on the visa officer to exercise a discretion under s. 11(3). As indicated, there was no application by the applicant for the exercise of discretion by the visa officer under s. 11(3) in this case.
