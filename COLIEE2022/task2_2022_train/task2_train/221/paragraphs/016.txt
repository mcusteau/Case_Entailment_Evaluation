  The Applicants also submitted that the Immigration Officer has fettered her discretion in refusing to place any weight on the Applicants' establishment in Canada because they had failed to abide by removal Orders issued in the summer 2003. According to the Applicants, section 25 clearly applies to any individuals in Canada that are inadmissible to Canada, as they were deemed to be from the moment they declared their intention to make a refugee claim in Canada. They also relied on immigration policy, which states that establishment in Canada is one of the factors to be considered. Finally, they contended that if the Immigration Officer's reasoning is allowed to stand, no application made pursuant to section 25 will ever receive a positive consideration in regard to establishment in Canada. This would be in direct contradiction to the purpose of section 25 of the IRPA, which was to allow persons in violation of Canadian immigration law to apply for permanent residence.
