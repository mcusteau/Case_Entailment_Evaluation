 [24] 
  In any event, the Immigration Officer did not refuse to consider the establishment of the Applicants in Canada, but decided to give this factor little weight. It cannot be said, therefore, that she fettered her discretion; quite to the contrary, she looked at all the circumstances before concluding as she did, and therefore exercised her discretion. Before turning to the Applicants' other arguments, I need only add that even if the Officer erred in this respect, it would not in and of itself make her decision as a whole unreasonable, since establishment is only one of the factors that can be taken into consideration to determine if an applicant would suffer undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if returned to his or her country of origin. I have not been persuaded that her decision with respect to this factor tainted her assessment of all the other factors to which she turned her mind.
