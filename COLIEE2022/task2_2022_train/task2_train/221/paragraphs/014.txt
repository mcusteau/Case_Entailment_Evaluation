  The second point can be disposed of summarily. In submissions made by counsel in May 2005, specific reference was made to the Federal Court's reasoning in Hawthorne v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] 2 F.C. 555, as well as to a decision rendered by an Australian Appeals Tribunal (Cabrera and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, [2004] AATA 1353). In response to these submissions, the Immigration Officer stated: "While I remain cognizant of some of what has been debated in front of the Canadian Federal Court; I am not a legal counsel and my only concern is the fair and impartial review of this particular application. I am guided in my duty by the Internal Processing Manual - IP5 and, pertaining to the best interest of the children, all specific content found under subsection 5.19 of the said manual."
