  Despite the apparent attractiveness of this argument, I have come to the conclusion that it must be rejected. There is no doubt that the removal order against the Applicants did come into effect in the summer of 2003, following the decision of the RPD to dismiss the refugee claim of the Applicants. It was statutorily stayed when the Applicants were notified that they could make a PRRA application, which they did in January of 2004, pursuant to section 232 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. This section reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 232. A removal order is stayed when a person is notified by the Department under subsection 160(3) that they may make an application under subsection 112(1) of the Act, and the stay is effective until the earliest of the following events occurs: 
 
 
 
 (a) the Department receives confirmation in writing from the person that they do not intend to make an application; 
 
 
 
 (b) the person does not make an application within the period provided under section 162; 
 
 
 
 (c) the application for protection is rejected; 
 
 
 
 (d) if a decision to allow the application for protection is made under paragraph 114(1)(a) of the Act and the person has not made an application within the period provided under subsection 175(1) to remain in Canada as a permanent resident, the expiry of that period; 
 
 
 
 (e) if a decision to allow the application for protection is made under paragraph 114(1)(a) of the Act, the decision with respect to the person's application to remain in Canada as a permanent resident is made; and 
 
 
 
 (f) in the case of a person to whom subsection 112(3) of the Act applies, the stay is cancelled under subsection 114(2) of the Act.
