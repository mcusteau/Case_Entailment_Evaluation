I do not agree with the defendant's reading of the Prothonotary's decision. Consideration of the evidence relating to the adjuster's intent in preparing the reports (evidence which was led by the defendant) was but one of the factors considered by Hargrave, P. The dates on which the reports were produced as compared to the date on which the insurers had appointed counsel to represent the defendant, the identity of the parties to whom the reports were addressed, and more importantly, the content of the reports themselves were all considered by the Prothonotary in reaching his decision as to whether or not the reports were privileged. Although the Prothonotary held that evidence regarding the insurer's intent in ordering the adjusters' reports would carry more weight than evidence regarding the intent of the adjuster who authored the reports, he did not state in his reasons that such evidence or the lack thereof was the governing factor in his decision. In fact, the content of the reports appears to have been a more important factor in the Prothonotary's decision, as is evident in the following passage of his reasons for order:
"In the present instance, even giving full weight to the affidavit of the Adjuster, for reasons which I will come to, three of the reports are not privileged. I have examined all the reports, as I am required to do so by the Court of Appeal decision in
Procter & Gamble v. Nabisco Brands
(1989), 97 N.R. 379 (F.C.A.): in examining them it is also clear that the first three reports are not privileged, however, as to the fourth report, that is clearly privileged with little or no help from the Adjuster's affidavit as to his intention."
