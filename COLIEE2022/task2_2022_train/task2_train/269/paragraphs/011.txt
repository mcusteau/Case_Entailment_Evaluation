The defendant submits that in determining whether litigation was in reasonable prospect at the time of the production of the reports, the court should first review the evidence and determine, based on all the surrounding facts whether a reasonable person in the adjuster's position would conclude that litigation is likely. According to the defendant, the state of mind of the adjuster, instructing insurer or counsel should not carry the day. [See footnote 1] The defendant asserts that in determining at what point the dominant purpose for the production of the reports became that of furthering the conduct of litigation, the court must conduct an objective analysis of the circumstances of the case. The defendant claims that the Prothonotary erred because "he was of the view that this part of the test required a subjective analysis of the thoughts and intentions of the parties to the report." (Defendant's written argument, at para. 25.)
