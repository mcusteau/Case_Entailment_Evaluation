The defendant appeals the Prothonotary's decision on three grounds:
"1. The Learned Prothonotary erred in law when he ruled that the dominant purpose for which the adjusters' reports were prepared should be based on the subjective opinions of the parties to the report, when this finding must be based on an objective analysis of all of the surrounding circumstances.
"2. The Learned Prothonotary erred when he ruled that in order for the adjusters' report to be privileged there must be evidence from the adjuster that it was prepared for the dominant purpose of immediately providing the report to counsel. In law, the objective test is whether the report is prepared to use it or its contents in order to obtain legal advice or to conduct or aid in the conduct of litigation.
"3. The Learned Prothonotary erred in law by failing to recognize the distinction between an adjusters' report prepared for a plaintiff or prosepective [sic] plaintiff, and an adjusters' report prepared for a defendant or intended defendant. Reports prepared for a prospective defendant when litigation is in reasonable contemplation and after a decision had been made to deny liability for the plaintiff's claim, are privileged."
