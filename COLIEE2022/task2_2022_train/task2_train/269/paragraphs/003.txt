The defendant claimed privilege over the adjuster's reports because "litigation was reasonably contemplated in this matter from the beginning and accordingly the dominant purpose for which the reports were prepared was to assist counsel in the conduct of anticipated litigation." (Affidavit of Elyn M.R. Underhill, Exhibit C.) In support of this assertion, the defendant filed an affidavit sworn by Mr. Mark Woodall, the senior adjuster who authored the four reports in question. Mr. Woodall deposed that at the time of his first report of June 27 1995, the information he had received made it clear to him that "a lawsuit would soon be commenced and Town Marine Electronics Ltd. appeared to have valid defences to the lawsuit." (

"... all of my reports were prepared for the dominant purpose of preparing counsel for litigation. It was apparent to me before I ever prepared my first report that Mr. Jordan would commence litigation in this matter. It was also apparent to me that Towns Marine Electronics should refuse to pay such a claim and should defend the matter as liability for the accident was very much in issue." (
