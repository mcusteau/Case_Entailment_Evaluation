The parties submit and I agree that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review. Because the RAD's assessment of an IFA is primarily a factual inquiry it attracts deference (
Dunsmuir v New Brunswick
, 2008 SCC 9 at para 53 [

]), it is also well-established that determinations on the availability of an IFA are reviewed on the reasonableness standard (
Momodu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2015 FC 1365 at para 6 [
Momodu
]).
