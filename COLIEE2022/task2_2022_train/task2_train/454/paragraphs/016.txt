I would first note that, as stated in
Calderon v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2010 FC 263 at para 10, if it is determined that an IFA exists, this is determinative of the claim for refugee protection:
10 The question of the existence of an IFA is determinative of the matter. As set out in
Irshad
, above, at paragraph 21, the concept of an IFA is an inherent part of the Convention refugee definition. In order to be considered a Convention refugee, an individual must be a refugee from a country, not from a region of a country. Therefore, where an IFA is found, a claimant is not a refugee or a person in need of protection (see
Sarker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration)
, 2005 FC 353, [2005] F.C.J. No. 435 (F.C.)).
