However, contrary to the Applicants' submissions, the RAD did consider the Riback Report. It did not dispute its clinical impression, but afforded it little weight because: the impression of the psychotherapist was based on a single 60-90 minute interview; its findings were based on self-reporting by the female Applicant and made no reference to the application of any additional clinical testing; and, because it offered no medical basis for its opinion. The RAD concluded that without a clinical basis upon which the opinion was formed it amounted to speculation based on self-reporting. In this regard I would note that the Riback Report states that the female Applicant was traumatised by the threats and abuse suffered at the hands of her ex-husband and that she would not be able to work through the past events and trauma as long as there was a threat of return to India. The author stated that she believed that returning to India would put the female Applicant in serious physical danger and would very likely cause her mental and physical stress symptoms to increase considerably, causing her psychological and emotional state to deteriorate. Further, that the family in whole would likely face danger and significant trauma if returned and that it was in their best interest to remain in Canada. If the female Applicant were to remain in Canada, then a plan of medical and therapeutic care could be implemented.
