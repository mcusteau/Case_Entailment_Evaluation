On the issue of state protection, the RAD found that despite the Applicants' claim that the police were unwilling to assist, the evidence indicated that the police had acted appropriately. During the first incident they spoke to the male and female Applicants as well as Subhas, gathered information and informed the female Applicant that if there were additional problems she should attend at the police station to open a First Information Report. After the second incident the police came to the family home. Although the Applicants were not happy with the police response, they did not contact a higher authority in the police department to complain. The RAD found that the Applicants' subjective reluctance to seek state protection did not rebut the presumption that state protection is available. Further, it found their allegations that the police were indifferent and unable to protect them from Subhas lacked credibility. The RAD noted that objective evidence on state protection in India is mixed and that the onus was on the Applicants to demonstrate that proposed IFA locations are unsuitable, which they had failed to do.
