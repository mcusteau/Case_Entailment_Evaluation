While the Applicants take issue with the RAD's comment that the female Applicant is married and would be accompanied to an IFA location by her husband, this was made in the context of RAD's quote of the
Gender Guidelines.
Specifically, that the
Gender Guidelines
state that decision-makers are required to consider the ability of women, because of their gender, to travel safely to the IFA and stay there without facing undue hardship. Further, the RAD's finding that the female Applicant will benefit from her husband's support is not unreasonable. Familial support, or lack thereof, has been considered as a factor in IFA analyses (

And, although the Applicants submit that gender based violence is central to their claim, I would note that based on the Applicants' evidence, the police reluctance to respond was not based on gender, but on religion. The male Applicant's affidavit states that the police told him following the school yard incident that they did not want to get involved in a religious confrontation and, as Subhas claimed to be Cheheleena's father, the police saw the matter as a private one concerning religion. Similarly, after the break in at the family's home, their neighbour stated that he did not want to go to the police as he was Muslim and did not want to get involved in religiously coloured matters.
