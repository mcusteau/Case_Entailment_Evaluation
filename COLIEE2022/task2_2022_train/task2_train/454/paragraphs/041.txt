In my view, even if this were accepted as evidence of a connection of Subhas to Sikh "fanatics", the Applicants do not explain how Subhas' alleged association with Sikh fundamentalists gives rise to a serious possibility of persecution in the proposed IFA locations and the record contains no evidence in that regard. The RAD also pointed out that the Applicants had been able to live in a community just 60 km outside of Delhi for ten years and were only located by Subhas when the female Applicant's family provided him with information. And, given the description of Subhas found in the lawyer's affidavit, it found that he likely did not have the ability to locate the Applicants among millions of people in major centers, long distances from his home. In my view, the RAD's conclusion was not unreasonable.
