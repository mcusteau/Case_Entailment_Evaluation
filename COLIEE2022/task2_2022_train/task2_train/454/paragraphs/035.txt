In my view, the jurisprudence suggests that the RAD was entitled to weigh the psychological evidence based on the source of the facts relied on, but that the Reports could not be dismissed solely because they relied on evidence from the female Applicant. However, that is not what the RAD did in this case. Here the RAD considered the totality of the evidence, including the Riback and Choi Reports, in determining that a suitable IFA was available to the Applicants. It did not afford the Riback and Choi Reports little weight solely because of the self-reporting, it also found that the analyses were not accompanied by or based on clinical testing. And while the Applicants take issue with the RAD's statement that the issues that caused the female Applicant to seek further medical intervention were not necessarily the direct result of the problems she encountered in India, the Choi Report specifically mentions a number of factors that were attributed to the female Applicant's overall distress. The RAD further found that the Applicants had failed to establish that treatment would be unavailable to the female Applicant in the proposed IFA locations. In my view, given the foregoing, the RAD's weighing of the psychological evidence was not unreasonable in this case, particularly considering the lack of any evidence that the female Applicant followed up on the treatment and medication proposed by the authors of those reports.
