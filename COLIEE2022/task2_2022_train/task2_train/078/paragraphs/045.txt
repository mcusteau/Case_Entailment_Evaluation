  One of the recognized elements of adaptability is the existence of family relationships in Canada. The Regulations (see ss. 83(1)(d) and 83(5)) provide that a skilled worker applicant "shall be awarded 5 points" if the skilled person (or his partner) is related to a person living in Canada who falls within the specific list of acceptable relatives described in s. 83(5). One of the listed relationships is "a child of the father or mother of their father or mother" (s. 83(5)(a)(iv)). Stated differently, the maternal uncle of a skilled worker or his spouse - provided that he is a citizen or permanent resident living in Canada - would qualify for the five points.
