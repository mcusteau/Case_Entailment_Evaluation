  Language skills are assessed pursuant to s. 79 of the Regulations. A maximum of 24 points, "based on the benchmarks referred to in  
 Canadian Language Benchmarks 
 ", may be awarded (Regulations, s. 79(2)). Of particular importance to this application, the Minister may designate organizations or institutions to assess language proficiency and "shall, for the purposes of correlating the results of such assessment by a particular designated organization or institution ..., establish the minimum test result required for each ability and each level of proficiency" (Regulations, s. 79(3)). The Minister has so designated, with such designations and correlations set out in OP6, the relevant Operating Manual of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC). In that regard, section 12.9 of OP6 sets out the tests score equivalency chart for IELTS test results. Finally, s. 79(4) of the Regulations provides that: 
 
 
 
 (4) The results of an assessment of the language proficiency of a skilled worker by a designated organization or institution and the correlation of those results with the benchmarks in accordance with subsection (3) are conclusive evidence of the skilled worker's proficiency in the official languages of Canada for the purposes of subsections (1) and 76(1).
