  The Applicant asserts that all this evidence would lead a reasonable person to conclude that Canadian banks would compete for him. The Applicant further notes that the Officer was aware that the Applicant's children were adults and could thus help support the family immediately or after graduation, on a long-term basis in a higher-paying professional position. The Applicant submits that, had the Officer considered the facts, she would have realized that the Applicant only had to support his wife and himself. The Applicant claims that, had the Officer not rendered her decision on outdated forms, she would have been aware of how well his daughters were doing in school and that one of them was in medical school, which would have assuaged any basis for fearing that the family is likely to become wards of the Crown if permitted to immigrate.
