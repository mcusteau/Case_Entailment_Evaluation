  The first point to be made is that s. 77 of the Regulations provides that "the requirements and criteria set out in sections 75 and 76 must be met at the time an application for a permanent resident visa is made  
 as well as at the time the visa is issued 
 ". If we turn to s. 76(1)(a)(vi), we can see that "adaptability, in accordance with section 83" is included. It follows that the points to be awarded in respect of any of the elements set out in s. 83 - including family relationships in Canada - must be met at the time the visa is granted. Thus, on a simple reading of the applicable Regulations, the Applicant's wife's uncle who no longer resides in Canada did not meet the requirement of the Regulations at the time the application was processed.
