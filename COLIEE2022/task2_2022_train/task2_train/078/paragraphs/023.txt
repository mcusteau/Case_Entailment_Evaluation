  Pursuant to s. 14 of IRPA, the detailed regulations regarding the assessment of persons coming to Canada have been enacted. The scheme of the Regulations is clear; the assessment of individuals within a class is to be carried out on an objective basis. The intention of the legislators is that the measurement of points, through an objective set of criteria across a variety of factors, will result in a transparent, consistent and reliable indicator of an applicant's ability to become established in Canada. All of the factors assessed - age, job offers, language skills, relatives in Canada, education - are indicators of the ability to become established in Canada.
