  In a letter dated October 8, 2010, counsel for the Applicant made a request for reconsideration. The main areas of concern related to an "under-assessment" of the Applicant's education and to the failure of the Officer to exercise "positive discretion" to approve the Applicant in spite of his failure to meet the points threshold. The matter was reconsidered and, in a letter dated October 20, 2010, the earlier decision was affirmed.
