  The allegation of apprehension of bias is being made against a judge who is bound by an oath of office and who bears a strong responsibility to be impartial. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Arsenault-Cameron v. PEI 
 , [1999] 3 SCR 851 at paragraph 2, "The test for apprehension of bias takes into account the presumption of impartiality. A real likelihood of bias must be demonstrated." Finally, I observe the reminder given by my colleague, Justice Teitelbaum, in  
 Samson Indian Nation and Band v. Canada 
 , [1998] 3 FC 3 (TD), at paragraphs 73 to 75, as to the solemnity of the judicial oath and the impartiality that it brings with it.
