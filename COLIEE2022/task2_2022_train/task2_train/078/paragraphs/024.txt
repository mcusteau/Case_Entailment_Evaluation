  Given the rationale of the Regulations, it appears to me that only in exceptional circumstances would this points assessment not be a fair evaluation of an applicant's ability to become established in Canada. However, there is a discretionary ability of a reviewing officer to "override" a negative (or positive) evaluation. Pursuant to s. 76(3) of the Regulations: 
 
 
 
 ... Â an officer may substitute for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(a) their evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada.
