Reed, J., refused an application to extend the time to file a notice of appeal on the grounds that an extension of time would be prejudicial to the respondent, the evidence did not disclose a good reason for the delay, and it was not shown that the appeal would have a reasonable chance of success on the merits. In her oral reasons for judgment, Madam Justice Reed indicated that she took into consideration three factors: the prejudice that would be suffered by the defendants if the time for appeal were extended; the reason for the delay; and whether or not the appeal would have a reasonable chance of success on the merits.
