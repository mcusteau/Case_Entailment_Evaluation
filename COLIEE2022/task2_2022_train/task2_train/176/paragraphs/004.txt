  The applicants were repeatedly harassed with threatening telephone calls from "Russian patriots" and letters from an anti-semitic group known as "Pamyat." The letters and telephone calls labelled the applicants as "Jewish swine" and warned them that they should leave the country, or face dire consequences. These calls and letters persisted until the applicants fled Russia. The Pamyat organization took over their daughter's apartment to use as a meeting place.
