  The Board clearly stated that it was not considering evidence of persecution that occurred before the female applicant returned from her trip to Canada. While the applicants may not have had a well-founded fear of persecution at that point, the cumulative nature of the attacks and racial slurs should have been taken into account when assessing the well-foundedness of their fear following the trip. The following episodes display a pattern of discrimination and harassment: 
 
 
 
 -	The male applicant was fired from his job because his daughter had fled Russia; 
 
 
 
 -	The applicants' car was repeatedly vandalized; 
 
 
 
 -	A note reading "Go to Israel and leave our country" was left on the car; - They received harassing telephone calls and letters; 
 
 
 
 -	Pamyat threatened to take over the applicants' apartment; 
 
 
 
 -	The female applicant was harassed and assaulted on Passover; 
 
 
 
 -	Slurs were painted on the applicants' apartment door; 
 
 
 
 -	The male applicant was assaulted twice and sustained injuries that required his hospitalization on one occasion; 
 
 
 
 -	The applicants' car was vandalized and a note stating, "Follow you daughter or face the consequences" was attached.
