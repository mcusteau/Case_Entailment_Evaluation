  Just as in Carrillo v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2004] F.C.J. No. 1152 (T.D.) (QL), and Sangaravelu v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2004] F.C.J. 176 (T.D.) (QL), it is my opinion that it was not unreasonable for the Board to expect claimants to have approached domestic authorities with respect to the abusive conduct of the State actors. As the Board's findings of fact were reasonable and the Board's analysis of the democratic state's political and judicial institutions was not patently unreasonable (it was supported by the evidence before the Board), the Board did not err in imposing an obligation to seek protection on the applicant.
