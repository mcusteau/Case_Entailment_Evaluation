  The Convention refugee system was designed to deal with the failure of national governments to protect their citizens from persecution (Zhuravlvev v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2000] 4 F.C. 3 (T.D.)). Absent a situation of complete breakdown of State apparatus, it should be assumed that the State is capable of protecting a claimant. In order for the appellant to overcome the presumption that the State is capable of protecting him or her, he or she has to advance clear and convincing confirmation of the State's inability to do so (Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689). Also, State protection need not be perfect protection (Canada (M.E.I.) v. Villafranca, [1992] F.C.J. No. 1189 (F.C.A.) (QL), leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada denied (1993), 19 Imm.L.R. (2d) 263).
