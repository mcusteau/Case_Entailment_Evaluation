Meanwhile, Ms. Marsh's husband had confirmed that her retirement move could be used to allow him to transfer to "K" Division. On June 7, 1999, Ms. Marsh submitted her Discharge Request Form. On the same day her husband submitted a memorandum requesting that he be designated for a vacant position in K Division. On June 8, 1999, Ms. Marsh sent an e-mail to the officer in charge of "E" Division Staffing. The e-mail set forth the provision and Ms. Marsh's advice that she was aware of other members of the Force who were allowed to take a pre-retirement move and then continue to work for another two years. The response she received was as follows:
"Shelly, at this time because of our fiscal and resourcing problems, we are not releasing members to other Divisions, unless the other division identifies a need to us and is willing to pay for both the exiting and the backfill moves. 'K' Division at this time has not indicated a need.
On retirement you are entitled to and you will qualify for reimbursement of real estate and legal fees. You are not entitled to a pre-retirement move and a new job for two years."
