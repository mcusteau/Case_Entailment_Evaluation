In my respectful view, it is not correct to assert that the Adjudicator ignored this evidence and instead held that no evidence had been adduced. In the words of the Adjudicator, Ms. Marsh "has not provided any specific examples of those situations". The Adjudicator did not say that she adduced no evidence and Ms. Marsh has not pointed to any such specific examples that she put in evidence.
