Part of the information provided by Inspector Boland in response to the grievance is set out above at paragraph 57. Inspector Boland was the Officer in Charge Policy and Recruiting Staffing and Personnel. Information he provided included that to "migrate towards inter-Divisional pre-retirement transfer considerations would be an unhealthy position for Staffing and Personnel to adopt, and to my knowledge, it is not done". In my view, this met the obligation to respond to the information provided by Ms. Marsh on her grievance. The Adjudicator did not err by concluding that the evidentiary burden remained upon Ms. Marsh. To conclude otherwise, and to have required more from the grievance respondent, would have required the grievance respondent to prove a negative, that is, to prove that moves of the sort alleged by Ms. Marsh were not happening in the circumstances she alleged.
Did the adjudicator base his decision on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner, or without reasonable regard to the material before him?
