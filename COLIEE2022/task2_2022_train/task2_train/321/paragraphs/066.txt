Given that the Adjudicator's interpretation was supported by evidence, and given that the evidence presented by Ms. Marsh was not inconsistent with that evidence, I have not been satisfied that the interpretation was made without regard to the evidence before the Adjudicator. The Adjudicator did not have before him evidence that the provision had ever been utilized as specifically alleged by Ms. Marsh.
