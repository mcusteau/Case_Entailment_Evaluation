Second, the evidence falls short of establishing that the provision was applied in an unfair or discriminatory manner. This is because in the response to Ms. Marsh's grievance, the respondent, Inspector Boland, (grievance respondent) noted that if there is a need within the RCMP that coincides with that of a member who seeks to retire, and both parties can benefit, consideration is given to those circumstances. He also noted that in Ms. Marsh's case neither Division "E" nor Division "K" were willing to fund the inter-divisional transfer of a member. This evidence was not contradicted by Ms. Marsh and so there is, at the least, conflicting evidence on the application of the provision.
