Relying upon the decisions of
NLK Consultants Inc. v. Human Rights Commission (B.C.)
(1999), 5 B.C.T.C. 337; 17 Admin. L.R.(3d) 46 (S.C.) and
Misra v. College of Physicians and Surgeons (Sask.)
, [1988] 5 W.W.R. 333; 70 Sask.R. 116 (C.A.), Ms. Marsh argues that unreasonable delay may amount to a breach of natural justice, a breach of procedural fairness, an abuse of discretion or an abuse of process. She characterizes the delay in dealing with her grievance to be unreasonable and argues that it resulted in a loss of jurisdiction, or breach of natural justice and procedural fairness. It follows, she says, that the Adjudicator's decision should be quashed and the Court should order that she:
1. be reinstated as a regular member of the RCMP as at December 1, 1999 until December 1, 2001;
2. receive retroactive pay from December 1, 1999 until December 1, 2001;
3. receive credit for pensionable service from December 1, 1999 until December 1, 2001;
4. receive reimbursement of real estate and legal fees for her move to Edmonton; and
5. receive the costs of this application.
