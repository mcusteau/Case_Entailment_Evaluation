However, those decisions pre-date the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Blencoe v. Human Rights Commission (B.C.) et al.
, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307; 260 N.R. 1; 141 Â B.C.A.C. 161; 231 W.A.C. 161, a decision the parties were referred to by the Court during oral argument. In
Blencoe
, the Court considered whether a remedy existed under principles of administrative law where delay arose in the context of a human rights proceeding. In view of the finding of fact made at first instance that prejudice resulting from the delay had not been established, the majority of the Court considered whether the delay could amount to a denial of natural justice or an abuse of process even where the subject of the human rights complaint had not been prejudiced in an evidentiary sense.
