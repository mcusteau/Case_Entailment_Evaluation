[45]
I accept that pursuant to this grant of jurisdiction there are circumstances in which the Court will issue directions on an application for judicial review that are so specific that they will compel the federal board, tribunal or commission to reach a specific conclusion. See, for example,
Turanskaya v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1997), 210 N.R. 235; 145 D.L.R.(4th) 259 (F.C.A.). In
Ali v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1994] 3 F.C. 73; 76 F.T.R. 182 (T.D.), this Court considered when such specific direction should be given. At paragraph 18, the Court considered the relevant factors to be:
- Is there evidence on record that is so clearly conclusive that there is only one possible conclusion?
- Is the sole issue to be decided a pure question of law which will be dispositive of the case?
- Is the legal issue based on uncontroverted evidence and accepted facts?
- Is there a factual issue which involves conflicting evidence which is central to the claim?
