First, it is not readily apparent to me that the provision should be interpreted as Ms. Marsh submits. On its face, the provision makes no reference to any right of a member to be transferred to another division in a pre-retirement move. The provision deals only with the reimbursement of real estate and legal fees where a principal residence is sold at the location of discharge and a new residence is acquired at the retirement destination. The provision is to be read in the context of section D.3 of the RCMP Career Management Manual which states:
"In the lateral transfer planning process although the personal circumstances and aspirations of members will be considered, the organizational needs of the RCMP take precedence."
