I have previously set out, at paragraph 38 above, the entire submission Ms. Marsh made in respect of delay. No submission was made by her that she either wanted to, or had tried to, obtain further evidence, but that she had been frustrated in that effort as a result of delay. In the result, in my view the Adjudicator committed no reviewable error in failing to address a matter not raised before him.
