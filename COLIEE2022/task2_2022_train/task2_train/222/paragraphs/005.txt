  In May, 2005, due to the delay in considering the application, the officer requested that a current application be completed "and all submissions Mr. Jeffrey wished to be considered" in his case. An up-dated application form was submitted together with additional information about his training and registration as an automotive service apprentice from Centennial College and the Ontario Ministry of Training. There is no indication on the Certified Record of any further submissions having been made to the immigration officer. A pre-removal risk assessment was conducted and he was found not to be at risk if he returns to Grenada.
