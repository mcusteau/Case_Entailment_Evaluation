 Mosley, J. 
 : Mr. Jeffrey's application for an exemption from visa requirements on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was refused by an immigration officer on July 18, 2005. He has sought judicial review on the ground that the officer did not provide adequate reasons to explain his decision that a waiver was not justified. These are my reasons for concluding that the application must be dismissed.
