  The respondent submits that the officer's reasons afforded the applicant the opportunity to know why his application was denied. As such, the reasons withstand a somewhat probing examination. The officer gave logical, rational reasons for refusing the application. With the exception of the applicant's sister, the applicant's family, including his eight year-old daughter are in Grenada. The applicant's evidence was that he had been steadily employed in Grenada before coming to Canada. On the facts before the officer, this was a sufficient reason to deny the application.
