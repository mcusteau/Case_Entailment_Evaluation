  The applicant blames his former immigration consultant for failing to include information about the applicant's child in Grenada and the support he was providing to the child and his mother from his Canadian employment. He does not explain why he did not take advantage of the second opportunity to provide the information when his application was updated in 2005. In any event, the consultant was acting merely as the applicant's agent and it was the applicant's personal responsibility to ensure that the officer had all of the evidence necessary to make an informed decision.
