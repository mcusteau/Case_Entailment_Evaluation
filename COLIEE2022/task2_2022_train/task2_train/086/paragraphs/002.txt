  The immigration officer refused approval, citing a number of reasons for reaching that decision. The refusal letter of February 17, 1992 reads: 
 
 
 
 "Your application has been refused because you are a member of the inadmissible class of person described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the  
 Immigration Act 
  in that you are not eligible for sponsorship under Immigration Regulations 4(1)(a). In my opinion, you entered into marriage with your sponsor primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada as a member of the family class and not with the intention of residing permanently with her. Consequently, you are a person described in Immigration Regulation 4(3). 
 
 
 
 "In reaching this decision, the following factors were taken into consideration: 
 
 
 
 - you admitted that your sponsor obtained landing by entering into a legally invalid marriage with her maternal uncle; 
 
 
 
 - as soon as the Immigration and Refugee Board quashed the removal order, she applied to have the six year 'material' relationship nullified; 
 
 
 
 - you and your sponsor are incompatible in terms of education. You are on the process of finalizing a Masters of Science Degree, whereas your sponsor completed only her matriculation; 
 
 
 
 - you and your sponsor are incompatible in age, as your sponsor is two years older than you, which is unusual among persons of your community; 
 
 
 
 - you indicated that you met your sponsor on April 5, 1991, married on April 7, 1991 and she returned to Canada on April 25, 1991. Since that time you could not substantiate any further communication with her. 
 
 
 
 - although you presented evidence of a well attended marriage ceremony you stated during your interview that any means justified the ends 'if you want permanent stay (residence) in Canada.' 
 
 
 
 - initially, you denied any knowledge of the name and relationship of your wife's first husband, or that she had entered a marriage within the prohibited degrees of relationship. Later you admitted that you were aware of the 'contrived' relationship. 
 
 
 
 "In sum, your claimed relationship with your sponsor does not conform to the custody practices of the community to which you and your sponsor belong and, therefore, does not appear to have been entered into for any other purpose but for you to obtain permanent residence in Canada."
