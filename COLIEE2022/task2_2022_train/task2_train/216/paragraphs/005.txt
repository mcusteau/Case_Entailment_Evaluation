  On considering de novo the question of delay in filing the Schwarz Affidavit, the evidence is that the Applicant had been "attempting to discuss a negotiated resolution, without success" (Ethier Affidavit, May 30, 2002, Applicant's Application Record, p. 86). I put weight on the fact that this statement is uncontested in the written record. Accordingly, I accept it as a valid reason for delay.
