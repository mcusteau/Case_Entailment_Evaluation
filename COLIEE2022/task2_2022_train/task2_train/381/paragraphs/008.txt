The respondent contends that the Regis足trar was correct in finding:
a) that the evidence filed by the respon足dent shows use of the trademark 'Vitaliano Pancaldi & Design' as registered in associ足ation with the following wares men足tioned in registration No. 379,823, i.e., high fashion clothing for women and men, ready-to-wear clothing, namely ties and foulards;
b) that the mark shown in the exhibits to the respondent's affidavit and the mark registered under No. 379, 829 is essentially the same mark, and as such, constitutes evidence of use of the trademark by the respondent/registrant;
c) that the attachment of photocopies of labels, rather than the labels themselves, in the present circumstances with the facts put forward by Mrs. Ziosi, is sufficient to show use of the trademark in the normal course of trade.
d) that a pocket scarf is a foulard.
