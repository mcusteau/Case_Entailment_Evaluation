On September 23, 1997, Mrs. Denise Savard, Senior Hearing Officer, Section 45 Division, made a decision on behalf of the Registrar of Trademarks. On one hand, the decision amended the registration to delete several items from the statement of wares: suits for men and women, tunics, blouses, shirts, chemises, dresses, jackets, pants, skirts, pullovers, belts, socks and shoes on the basis that the trademark was not in use during the relevant time frame. On the other hand, the Registrar maintained the registraÂ­tion for high-fashion clothing for women and men, ready-to-wear clothing, namely, ties and foulards.
