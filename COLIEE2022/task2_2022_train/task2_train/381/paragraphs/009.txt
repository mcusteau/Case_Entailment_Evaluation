The appellant's submissions raise the main issue of whether the Registrar of Trademarks erred in finding that the re足spon足dent established use of the trademark as registered in No. 379,823 in conjunction with ties and foulards. However, this issue is contingent upon the determination of the following subsidiary issues:
i) whether the introduction of photocopies of sample labels into evidence by way of affidavit is sufficient to show use of a trademark;
ii) whether the trademark as it appears on the invoices and labels is substantially different from that registered under No. 379, 823, and as such incapable of estab足lishing use of the said registered trade足mark;
iii) whether the so-called "pocket scarf" is a foulard and as such used in conjunction with the said registered trademark.
