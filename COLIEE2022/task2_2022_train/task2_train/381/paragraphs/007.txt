[7]
The appellant takes the following posi­tion on the issues:
a) The registrar erred in finding that the evidence filed by the respondent showed use of the trademark "Vitaliano Pancaldi (White) & Design" as registered in assoc­iation with any of the wares covered under registration No. 379, 823, and in particular, in association with high-fashion clothing for women and men, and ready-to-wear clothing, namely ties and foulards.
b) The registrar erred in holding that the mark shown in the exhibits attached to the respondent's affidavit and the mark regis­tered under No. 379,823 was essentially the same mark, and as such, constituted evidence of use of the trademark by the registrant.
c) The registrar erred in finding that the attachment of photocopies of labels, rather than the labels themselves, is sufficient to show use of the trademark in the normal course of trade.
d) The registrar erred in finding that a pocket scarf is a foulard.
