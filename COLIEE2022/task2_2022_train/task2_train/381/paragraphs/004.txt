At the appellant's request, s. 45 proceed­ings were initiated by the Registrar of Trade­marks against registration No. 379, 823, by notice dated February 20, 1996. In response to these proceedings, the respon­dent filed evidence by way of affidavit, signed by Mrs. Leda Ziosi, dated August 27, 1996. Based on this evidence, Mrs. Denise Savard, Senior Hearing Officer, Section 45 Division, issued a decision on behalf of the Registrar of Trademarks maintaining regis­tration of the trademark "Vitaliano Pancaldi & Design" in association with "high fashion clothing for women, men and ready-to-wear clothing, namely: ties and foulards" (Appel­lant's Record, pages 7-10). In these pro­ceed­ings, the appellant only appeals from the decision of the Registrar dated Septem­ber 23, 1992 which maintained the trade­mark in associ­ation with ties and foulards.
