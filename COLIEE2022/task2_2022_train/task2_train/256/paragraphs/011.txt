The Citizenship and Immigration Canada Immigration Manual, Overseas Processing (the CIC manual), which stipulates how visa officers are to evaluate applications for visas to Canada, recognizes that applicants for student visas are a good source of skilled immigrants:
"Section 3.5.2
In establishing whether a foreign student is a bona fide visitor, officers should be guided by the knowledge that foreign students educated in Canada provide needed links for trade and investment, and that they are an excellent source of future skilled immigrants."
