One of the visa officer's reasons for refusing the applicant's application for a student authorization to Canada was that the applicant had not overcome the legal presumption that all individuals seeking to enter Canada are presumed to be immigrants. This decision was based on her interpretation of subsection 9(1.2) of the
Immigration Act
as meaning that a visa officer may refuse an application for temporary entry into Canada if the visa officer is not satisfied that the applicant does not intend to immigrate to Canada.
