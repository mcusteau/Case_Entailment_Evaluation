  Mr. Clue's complaint that the allegations against him could not be relied upon by the Director because they had not been proven against him in a criminal proceeding is without merit. The decision not to prosecute Mr. Clue for the handgun incident is explained in the record as a lack of evidence sufficient to meet a criminal standard of proof. For purposes of revocation of a TSC the standard of proof is much lower and requires only a reasonable belief, on a balance of probabilities, that a person  
 may 
  be prone or induced to commit and act (or to assist such an act) that  
 may 
  unlawfully interfere with civil aviation. This provision involves an assessment of a person's character or propensities ("prone or induced to") and it does not require evidence of the actual commission of an unlawful act: see  
 Fontaine 
 , above, at para 78, 81 and 83. What the Director is called upon to do is to examine a person's behaviour to determine if, on balance, it supports a reasonable belief that a person may in the future be inclined to act unlawfully in the context of aeronautical safety. The Director's negative assessment of an employee's attitude towards airport security concerns may, as it did in this case, provide an evidentiary basis for the revocation of a TSC. Here the decision was also supported by evidence that Mr. Clue had been directly involved in the loading of a bag containing a handgun on an aircraft and, taken together, this was sufficient to support a reasonable belief that he may be prone to commit or to assist with an act that may unlawfully interfere with civil aviation.
