  I reach the same conclusion about his finding that there was no persuasive evidence that she would return to Romania at the end of her short-term contract. The evidence before the visa officer included the comments of the IPO that she lived with her family of five in a 3-room flat, that her salary was comparatively low, that the financial situation there was difficult, that she had no ties there and that her explanation concerning cancellation of her UAE visa and her visit to that country was not credible. While not all of those grounds might support the conclusion that the visa officer reached, in my view they did provide sufficient bases for his conclusion that it was questionable whether she would return to Romania at the conclusion of her contract in Toronto.
