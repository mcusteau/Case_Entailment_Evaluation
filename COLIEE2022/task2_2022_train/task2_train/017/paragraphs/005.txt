  On 12 June 2003, D.B. Gibson, Director, Halifax Tax Services Office, issued his review of the decision conveyed on 23 December 2002 by J.F. Lee. He went through the three items at issue: delay in processing the amount of interest owing, financial hardship and mental distress. He concluded that the decision of Mr. Lee was correct. However, due to a delay in the King test case at the Federal Court of Appeal level, he cancelled interest from 29 May 2000 to 15 January 2001.
