  The facts are not really in dispute. In 1987, Mr. Dort invested in a partnership known as "Records International". In his 1987 income tax return, which was timely filed on or before 30 April 1988, he claimed a business loss as a result thereof. The respondent alleges that he was advised in September 1988 that the processing of his 1987 return was delayed while Revenue Canada was reviewing the partnership. His return was assessed 12 July 1990 and the business loss was allowed.
