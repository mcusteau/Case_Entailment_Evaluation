[59]
I think it unlikely that any person would willingly assume such a role if they faced a risk of bearing legal costs in an action brought by the very party on whose behalf they were acting whether that action proved to be successful or otherwise. In many situations of this sort, one could expect to see a bylaw provision requiring that individuals acting in this capacity be indemnified for any legal costs they incur in the good faith exercise of their responsibilities. Here the
Act
makes no such provision, but there is authority in election cases for an award of solicitor-client costs and I will apply that authority to the case at bar: see
Janigan v. Harris
(1989), 62 D.L.R.(4th) 293 (H.C.), and
O'Donohue v. Silva et al.
(1995), 87 O.A.C. 161; 130 D.L.R.(4th) 334 (C.A.).
