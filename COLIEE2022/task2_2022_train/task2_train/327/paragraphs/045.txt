The existence of a solicitor-client relationship with one of the parties to a dispute has been found to constitute bias, and was sufficient to disqualify the lawyer from acting as an arbitrator, even though the existing relationship was unrelated to the matter in dispute: see
Ghirardosi v. British Columbia (Minister of Highways)
, [1966] S.C.R. 367. In this case, the solicitor-client relationship between Ms. Gollan and Chief Atcheynum cannot be described as wholly unrelated to the mandate of the Tribunal, and the perception of bias is thereby magnified.
