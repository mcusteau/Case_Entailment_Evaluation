Many of the steps required for a Band election and for an appeal from an election are governed by time limits. For example, an election must be called within the last six (6) months of the Council's final year in office (every second year) but fixed no earlier than the fifteenth (15th) day of the penultimate month in office and no later than seven (7) days before the second anniversary date in office. The Tribunal also faces a number of time requirements for completing its mandate including the holding of a public appeal hearing within thirty (30) days following the filing of an election appeal.
