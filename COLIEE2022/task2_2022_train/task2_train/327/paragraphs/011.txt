On Thursday, August 18, 2005, the Chief and Council for Sweetgrass convened a regular meeting. The Minutes of that meeting reflect the transaction of a number of business items including the call of a Band Election for November 13, 2005. The Minutes also disclose the selection of the Defendant, Lori Gollan, as Tribunal Chair, along with Fred Paskemin as the second member of the Tribunal. At that point Ms. Gollan was legal counsel to the Band and she was in attendance at the meeting. Ms. Gollan requested a one thousand-dollar retainer ($1,000.00) for her services as Tribunal Chair, to be returned to Sweetgrass if no appeal was launched from the election results.
