  As articulated in  
 Dunsmuir v New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 SCR 190 at para 47, reasonableness is "concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process" as well as "whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
