  In  
 Perreault v. Treasury Board (Transport Canada) 
 , File No. 166-2-26094 the employer relied on  
 Burchill 
  to try to have a grievance dismissed on the ground that the allegation of bad faith, which was made for the first time before the adjudicator, had the effect of transforming the original grievance into a new grievance. Adjudicator Tenace disposed of this argument as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Counsel for the employer also submitted that the grievor had referred a new grievance to adjudication inasmuch as the grievor was alleging bad faith for the first time at adjudication. In my opinion, the grievor's meaning and intention have been reasonably clear throughout. He believes that he was not given a 'fair shake' during his training period and he felt that management wanted to get rid of him. This becomes quite clear when one reads the lengthy attachment which the grievor wrote to accompany his grievance. In my opinion, the facts do not mesh with the reasoning expressed in  
 Burchill 
 , supra, and it has no application to the instant case."
