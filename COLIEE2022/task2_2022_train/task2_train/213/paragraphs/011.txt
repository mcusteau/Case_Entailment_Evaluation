  The respondent submits that the failure to mention the relevant statutory provisions in his grievance or to use the exact wording that appears in the statute does not bar it. He further submits that the sole purpose of the evidence he intends to adduce before the Adjudicator is to define the exact scope of the grievance and that no alteration is contemplated. The respondent concedes that a lay-off within the meaning of s. 29 of the  
 Public Service Employment Act 
  is outside the Adjudicator's jurisdiction. However, he submits that the disguised dismissal he intends to prove is clearly within the jurisdiction conferred on the Adjudicator by s. 92 of the  
 Public Service Staff Relations Act 
 . [see footnote 8]
