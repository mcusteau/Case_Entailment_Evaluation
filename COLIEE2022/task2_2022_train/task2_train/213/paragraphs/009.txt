  The hearing of the grievance commenced on April 1, 1996. Following the parties' representations on the applicant's preliminary objection, the Adjudicator decided that she had jurisdiction to hear the grievance insofar as the respondent satisfied her that his lay-off was a subterfuge to terminate his employment. [see footnote 6] She therefore decided to pursue the hearing. When the hearing resumed the next morning, counsel for the employer advised the Adjudicator of his intention to apply for a writ of prohibition against that decision. The Adjudicator accordingly adjourned the hearing. She also agreed to prepare a written version of the oral decision she had rendered at the hearing the previous day. Her decision reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 "If you establish that the termination of the employment was not a genuine layoff but rather a decision made in bad faith, a ruse, a disciplinary dismissal in disguise, then I would be willing to say that subsection 92(3) of the  
 Public Relations [sic] Staff Relations Act 
  does not prevent me from having jurisdiction. I would therefore be willing to hear your witnesses."
