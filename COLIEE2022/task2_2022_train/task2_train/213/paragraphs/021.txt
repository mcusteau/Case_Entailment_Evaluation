  The respondent states that his grievance challenged the decision to "terminate" [see footnote 12] his employment. He stresses the fact that his grievance asked that any necessary action be taken to alleviate the damage done to his reputation. [see footnote 13] According to him, a person's reputation cannot be damaged if his or her employment is terminated due to factors beyond anyone's control, such as a shortage of work. However, a person's reputation can be damaged if he or she is unlawfully dismissed, as the respondent claims to have been. Finally, the respondent submits that if the applicant misunderstood the grievance when it was made, she cannot hold it against him today. [see footnote 14]
