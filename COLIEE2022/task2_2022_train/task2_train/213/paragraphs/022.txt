  The importance of the wording of a grievance lies in the fact that the allegations made in it have the effect of attributing jurisdiction. Since the adjudication procedure provided for in the  
 Public Service Staff Relations Act 
  follows on a conciliation process, only those grievances that have been presented at all the levels provided for in the  
 Act 
  can be referred to adjudication. [see footnote 15] It follows that an employee cannot change the nature of his or her grievance once it is before an adjudicator, as the effect of doing so would be to submit a grievance to adjudication that has not been presented at all the levels of conciliation provided for in the  
 Act 
 . In my view, that is what led Thurlow, C.J., to say the following in  
 Burchill v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1981] 1 F.C. 109; 37 N.R. 530 (F.C.A.) 
 
 
 
 "In our view, it was not open to the applicant, after losing at the final level of the grievance procedure the only grievance presented, either to refer a new or different grievance to adjudication or to turn the grievance so presented into a grievance complaining of disciplinary action leading to discharge within the meaning of subsection 91(1). Under that provision it is only a grievance that has been presented and dealt with under section 90 and that falls within the limits of paragraph 91(1)(a) or (b) that may be referred to adjudication. In our view the applicant having failed to set out in his grievance the complaint upon which he sought to rely before the Adjudicator, namely, that his being laid off was really a camouflaged disciplinary action, the foundation for clothing the Adjudicator with jurisdiction under section 91(1) was not laid. Consequently, he had no such jurisdiction." (at p. 110)
