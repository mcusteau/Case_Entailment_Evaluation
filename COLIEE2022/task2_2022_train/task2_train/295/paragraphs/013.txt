The decisions cited above state that the grievance system set out in the
Act
, the
Regulations
, Commissioner's Directive 540 and his Standard Operating Practices are an appropriate statutory procedure which should ordinarily be exhausted before an application for judicial review is made, at least when the matter involves a security rating or placement, including involuntary transfer from one correctional institution to another. In the case at bar, the applicant challenged the legality of certain administrative actions involving the use of computers and computer equipment. Those actions had an ongoing effect over time. In the case at bar, it was submitted by the respondents that the various disputed actions taken by officers of the Service were authorized by the Commissioner himself. Further, the applicant was also challenging the validity of Commissioner's Directive 090. The Commissioner is the third and final national level. There is thus no internal appeal from the said decision. Regardless of whether the Commissioner is a court of competent jurisdiction within the meaning of section 24 of the
Charter
(we may recall here that the applicant also argued that Directive 090 and the administrative actions taken pursuant to it are contrary to the
Charter
), it is clear that if the applicant had filed a grievance with the Commissioner the latter would then have been in a conflict of interest, since he might eventually be called on to rule on the scope and legality of his own decision. The grievance procedure confirms my position. It states that no staff member concerned in a complaint or grievance may review that complaint or grievance or decide on its validity.
