That said, the application for judicial review at bar came on for hearing on the merits in this Court for the first time on May 26, 2005, following an order to set a date and time, dated March 11, 2005, made by Lutfy, C.J., and signed by the judicial administrator. About ten days before the hearing, on May 13, 2005, counsel for the respondents sent the Registrar a letter in which she briefly requested that the Court accept the late filing of the respondents' record, served on the applicant on the same day. On May 17, 2005, Rouleau, J., exempted the respondents from filing and serving a motion record, authorized the filing of the respondents' record and ordered that the hearing by conference call proceed as scheduled on May 26, 2005. In the meantime, the applicant filed an application for reconsideration, which was argued on a preliminary basis on May 26, 2005, before Blais, J., who was presiding at the hearing on the merits.
