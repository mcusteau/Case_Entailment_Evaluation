  With respect, I disagree that the concept of sojourning as expressed at paragraph 49(1.1)(a) of the  
 Act 
  contains an intentional component. The usual meaning of sojourn is a temporary stay in a place, regardless of an individual's intention or particular reasons for that stay. The  
 New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary 
  [see footnote 2] defines a "sojourn" as follows: "a temporary stay at a place; a delay; a digression." The verb "to sojourn" is defined as "stay temporarily; reside for a time. Tarry, delay." Other dictionaries propose similar definitions. The  
 Canadian Dictionary of the English Language 
  [see footnote 3] defines the verb "sojourn" as "To reside temporarily" and the noun as "A temporary stay; a brief period of residence."  
 Roget's International Thesaurus 
  [see footnote 4] provides the following synonyms for sojourn: "sojourning, sojournment, temporary stay; stay, stop; stopover, stopoff, stayover, layover."
