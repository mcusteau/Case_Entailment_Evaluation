  The Respondent submits that the Removal Order is legal and valid pursuant to the following exception to a statutory stay set out at paragraph 49(1.1)(a) of the  
 Act 
 : 
 
 
 
 "Subsection (1) [of section 49–i.e., the stay of execution provision–] does not apply to 
 
 
 
 (a) a person residing or sojourning in the United States or St.Pierre and Miquelon who is the subject of a report made pursuant to paragraph 20(1)(a)." 
 
 
 
 In the Respondent's submission, since the Applicants entered Canada from the United States, paragraph 49(1.1)(a) of the  
 Act 
  applies and consequently, there is no statutory stay of the execution of the removal order.
