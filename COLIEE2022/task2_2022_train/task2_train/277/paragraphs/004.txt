In his affidavit filed in reply to this motion, Mr. Allan Manson declares he is still the solicitor of record for the plaintiff. Since 1981, he has been a full-time law teacher at Queen's University. His client, the plaintiff, was transferred from the Ontario Region to a Saskatchewan Penitentiary in early 1979 and has been imprisoned in various penitentiaries in Western Canada since that time. Mr. Manson has neither seen his client nor spoken to him since his transfer to the west, although he received correspondence from him in 1980 and 1981. He admits that "entirely through my own responsibility, I lost track of Mr. Nichols' file at that time and it remained in a file box of old files until I was contacted by Mr. David Sgayias, of the Department of Justice, in 1987".
