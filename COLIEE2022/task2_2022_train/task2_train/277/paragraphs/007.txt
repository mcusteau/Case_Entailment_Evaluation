The issue to be resolved is whether, under the circumstances, it is still possible to have a fair trial after such a long delay. The classic test to be applied in these matters is threefold: first, whether there has been an inordinate delay; secondly, is the delay inexcusable; and thirdly, whether the defendants are likely to be seriously prejudiced by the delay (See Salmon, L.J., in Allen v. Sir Alfred McAlpine & Sons Ltd., [1968] 2 Q.B. 229, at p. 268).
