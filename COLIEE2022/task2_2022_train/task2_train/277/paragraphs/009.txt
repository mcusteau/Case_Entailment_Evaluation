In the judgment above-quoted, Salmon, L.J., said (at pp. 268 and 269) that "as a rule, the longer the delay, the greater the likelihood of serious prejudice at the trial". Obviously, the passage of time weakens the recollection of events on the part of witnesses: more particularly so in matters of alleged negligence where the evidence of witnesses is of critical significance. In the present case, it is fair to assume that the two physicians involved would have been the key witnesses (apart from the plaintiff himself), and Dr. Lyle Brennan died in 1988.
