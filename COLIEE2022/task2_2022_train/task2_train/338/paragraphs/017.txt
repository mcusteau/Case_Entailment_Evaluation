Mr. Justice Cullen's references to a violation of the
Charter
are, I conclude, overtaken by the
Luitjens
decision cited earlier. On the issue of fairness, there simply was no evidence adduced before me that the respondent has been in any sense prejudiced by the delay that occurred in this matter. Indeed, it might be argued in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the respondent, rather than suffering prejudice, benefitted from the fact that he has remained in Canada, as a Canadian citizen, throughout the length of time taken to bring this matter before this court.
