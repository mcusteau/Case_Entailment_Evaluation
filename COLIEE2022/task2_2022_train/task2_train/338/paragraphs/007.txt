In
Canada v. Sadiq
(1990), 39 F.T.R. 200; 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 231 (T.D.), Cullen, J., wrote:
"Because of the seriousness of the proceedings, the standard of proof required of such alleged civil fraud in revocation proceedings will be a high level of probability."
In
Canada (Minister of Multiculturalism and Citizenship) v. Minhas
(1993), 66 F.T.R. 155 (T.D.), Associate Chief Justice Jerome wrote:
"In order to succeed, the Minister must do more then merely demonstrate that the respondent has committed a technical transgression of the
Act
. The words used in subs. 10(1) do not impute an offence requiring the full criminal standard of proof 'beyond a reasonable doubt', but rather have the effect of saving innocent misrepresentations from the severe penalty of revocation of citizenship. An innocent statement or representation, although false and misleading, is not sufficient to invoke or justify such a penalty. There is a further element of proof required, relating to the respondent's state of mind, and the onus of that proof rests with the Minister. What is required, therefore, is some evidence that the respondent misrepresented pertinent facts with the intention to deceive and to obtain his citizenship on the basis of those false representations."
