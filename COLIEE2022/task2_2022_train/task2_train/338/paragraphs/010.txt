The Notice of Reference to the court was made at the request of the respondent. I am satisfied that, in requesting the reference, the respondent must have been aware of the allegations against him and that those allegations, made in the terms of s. 18 of the
Citizenship Act
, were set forth in the notice in sufficient particularity. No breach of the duty of fairness resulted.
