The evidence provided on behalf of the applicant consisted of an appropriately certified copy of a microfilmed copy of the applicant's application for citizenship, the original having been destroyed. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the certified copy of the microfilmed copy represented the best evidence available and, though it was somewhat difficult to decipher, the viva voce evidence presented to aid in its interpretation was sufficient for the purposes of this civil proceeding. In addition, the applicant relied upon the respondent's statement cited above. Once again, the statement, taken together with the viva voce evidence of the RCMP officer who took the statement, was, I am satisfied, sufficient to establish that the statement was voluntarily made, that it was understood by the respondent and that he in fact signed it. None of the voluntariness of the statement, the respondent's understanding of its contents or the authenticity of the respondent's signature to the statement was put in doubt by evidence of or on behalf of the respondent.
