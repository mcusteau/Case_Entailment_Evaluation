Evidence came to the attention of the applicant, and through the applicant the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, to the effect that, from sometime in 1975 until sometime in 1984, the respondent worked on a full-time basis in Pakistan, although he returned to Canada for his holiday periods. He was twice interviewed by the RCMP in March of 1992. At the second interview, he allegedly voluntarily signed the following statement which had been written out by the interviewing officer:
"On 73-02-20 I arrived in Canada and was sponsored by my brother Mr. Masood Malik.
"From 1973 until approximately 1975 (not the full year) I worked in Toronto, Ontario.
"From 1975 until 1984 I worked full time at the Sui-Gas Department in Lahore, Pakistan and lived at House No. 15 Wiazi Street, Muslin Col. NY, Muslin Road Samanabad Lahore. During my holidays I would come back to Canada . My holidays would be anywhere from 2-3 months I would sometimes apply to even longer holidays and stay in Toronto, Ontario. In 1985 I resigned from the Gas Department. From 1985 until 1989 I worked full time at my brother's Drug Store, "AZAD MALIK DRUGS LTD." 1428 OUELLETTE, Windsor, Ont.
"At the end of 1989 I went back to Pakistan. I stayed in Pakistan for 2-3 months & then returned to Toronto where I have remained ever since.
"All these dates are approximate."
The interviewing officer appeared as a witness before me. He testified that the statement was voluntarily made, that, although it was written by him, it was read back to the respondent, and read by the respondent, that the respondent appeared to fully understand it, and that the signature appearing on the statement is that of the respondent.
