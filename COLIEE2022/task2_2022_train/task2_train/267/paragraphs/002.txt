The applicant moves for those remedies pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Court Act and to Rule 324. In the case of Daniel Lorne Edward Gammond v. National Parole Board, T-1580-85, Mr. Justice McNair dismissed just such a motion on December 17, 1985. He did so because he had "grave misgivings that service was not properly effected" and noted that the respondent had "not filed any representations in reply to the 324 motion nor has it given any indication of its intention to do". Such is not the situation here, for the (same) respondent by its solicitors and counsel has made a very full response to the motion with affidavits and written argument. The applicant has been a trifle prolix, but basically he has confined his written argument into a more-than-one-part submission and a reply to the respondent's written arguments. In this regard the present matter is quite different from that of the Gammond case.
