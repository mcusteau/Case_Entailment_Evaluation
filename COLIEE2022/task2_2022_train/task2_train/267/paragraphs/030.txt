As with revocation, the appropriateness of an oral hearing for deciding on full parole is not in question here. Day parole is of a more limited probationary nature; and the kind of decision-making process appropriate for the principles of fundamental justice, for the inmate, and for society in which the inmate seeks to be conditionally liberated, must be viewed through the optic of the statutory scheme. Parliament wills that the offender be subjected to the denunciation and punishment of an apt, lawful sentence. But Parliament relents in according the board discretion to permit certain well-behaved inmates to avoid the punishment of incarceration, by serving some part of the apt term to which they were lawfully sentenced outside of the prison. Parliament has ordained, by section 11 of the Parole Act, that the inmate seeking day parole is not entitled to be personally interviewed, that is, to have an oral hearing of his request.
