[34]
These reasons address past events. Although the court's conclusion regarding the matters in dispute indicates that the respondent is under no constitutional or other legal duty to provide an in-person or oral hearing of the applicant's request for parole, nothing herein should be construed to inhabit the respondent from granting day parole to the applicant if, in the respondent's lawfully exercised discretion, he now or later merits such consideration. Obviously, his institution of the proceedings herein should not count against him in that regard. That noted, the applicant's motion for certiorari, mandamus or, in the alternative an order requiring a new hearing, is dismissed with costs.
