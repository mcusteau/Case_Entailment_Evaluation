Here again there was no accuser (known or unknown) in any sense of the word to be faced by the applicant. If there were, he would, of course, have the right to face, and question, his accuser(s). Here there were no accuser(s) and no material or other information kept from the applicant's ken. There was no information on file which could be considered confidential. Here, then, there can be no valid complaint to the effect that the board might have been influenced by some unfavourable allegations of which the applicant knew nothing. He was full apprised. This case, then, fits not within the rule formulated in the Singh case, but rather within the exceptions expressed by both factions of the Supreme Court.
