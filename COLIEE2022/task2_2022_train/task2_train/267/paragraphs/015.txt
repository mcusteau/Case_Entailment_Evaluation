Ms. Harrison's affidavit continues, in regard to the request for day parole.
"11. That the reasons given to the applicant for not granting him day parole were communicated to him in the form of a Notification dated October 22, 1985, a copy of which is attached to my affidavit and marked as Exhibit 'G'.
"12. That the above decision dated October 22, 1985, is the same decision as the one attached to the applicant's affidavit marked as Exhibit 'G'.
"13. That the reason the applicant was denied day parole was that there was still a concern regarding the applicant's involvement with drugs in the institution and that he might re-offend.
"14. That I considered the recommendations presented by the Case Management Team dated October 3, 1985, as set out in Exhibit 'E', but that I was still concerned about the applicant's risk to re-offend.
"15. That with regard to paragraph 5 of the applicant's affidavit, the board did not receive a request for an oral hearing from the applicant following the board's letter of April 10, 1985, stating that the Parole Board would make a decision without conducting a personal interview.
"16. That with regard to paragraph 10 of the affidavit, I took into consideration the trial judge's decision at the sentencing hearing. However, it was obvious to me, given the applicant's involvement with drugs in the institution, that the rehabilitation of the applicant had not been achieved.
"17. That with regard to paragraphs 11 through 18 and 20 through 22, I took into account all the factors listed by the applicant, but it was still my opinion that day parole should not have been granted in either September or October of 1985 for reasons set out earlier in paragraphs 7 and 13 of this my affidavit."
