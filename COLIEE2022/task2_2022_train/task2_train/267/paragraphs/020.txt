The Supreme Court's two approaches to the matter are instructive for, despite the divergence of basic emphasis in resolving the issues, both groups of judges began by identifying the statutory source of alleged rights. Madam Justice Wilson, writing also for Chief Justice Dickson and Mr. Justice Lamer, is reported at p. 188 S.C.R. as noting that: "If, as a matter of statutory interpretation, the procedural fairness sought by the appellants is not excluded by the scheme of the Act, there is, of course, no basis for resort to the Charter". Mr. Justice Beetz, writing also for Messrs. Justices Estey and McIntyre, is reported at p. 228 S.C.R. as noting that: "Accordingly, the process of determining and redeterimining appellants' refugee claims involves the determination of rights and obligations for which the appellants have, under s. 2(e) of the Canadian Bill of Rights, the right to a fair hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."
