[29]
Conceptually and actually the deprivation by revocation of even a conditional liberty which has already been accorded is different from, and more serious than, the discretionary withholding of such a conditional liberty in the first place. Such was the thrust of the judgment of this court in Hay v. National Parole Board et al., 13 Admin. L.R. 17; 21 C.C.C.(3d) 408. The cases of R. v. Cadeddu, 32 C.R.(3d) 355: 146 D.L.R.(3d) 629, Re Lowe and The Queen (1983), 5 C.C.C.(3d) 535, Re Dumoulin and The Queen (1984), 6 C.C.C.(3d) 190, and Re Swan and The Queen (1984), 7 C.C.C. 150, are all cases concerned with revocation of parole.
