Furthermore, what is at stake in an application for day parole is very different in nature and degree from what is at stake in the determination of refugee status. With respect, there is merit in the notion expressed by Mr. Justice McNair in O'Brien v. National Parole Board, [1984] 2 F.C. 314, at p. 326:
"... The subject-matter of the application was simply a request. There was no question of the deprivation of any constitutionally enshrined right of liberty, conditional or otherwise, such as might occur with the revocation or parole and its consequences on earned remission or the suspension of madatory supervision. The applicant made a request for the granting of a privilege which was denied in accordance with the clearly mandated legislative provision. To my mind, a distinction must be drawn betwen a denial affecting the expectation of enjoyment of some anticipated privilege of liberty and the deprivation of some right of liberty, presently existing and enjoyed, where such deprivation is contrary to fundamental justice."
