It is noteworthy, as will become evident later in these reasons, that the two forms of Notification of National Parole Board Decision appended as Exhibits C and G to Ms. Harrison's affidavit (dated respectively September 20 and October 24 in 1985, both bear the following message:
"You may request that this decision be re-examined by the National Parole Board Appeal Committee in Ottawa. Your completed 'Request for Re-examination of Decision' form should be received by the Case Analysis and Review Section, National Parole Board, 340 Laurier Avenue West, Ottawa Ontario, K1A OR1 within thirty (30) days of the date of this notification, This form (NP B32) is available at the institution."
That message neither offers nor forecloses an in-person review but, since the re-examination would be performed by the committee in Ottawa, it tends to imply that the re-examination could not involve the applicant's personal participation or attendance before the committee.
