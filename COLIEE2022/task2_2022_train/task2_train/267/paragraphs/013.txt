"6. That in reaching this decision, I considered the Case Management Team's recommendation that day parole be granted. A copy of the Case Management Team's Progress Summary and Recommendations dated August 22, 1985 is attached to my affidavit and marked as Exhibit 'D'."
This document, a very favourable report, signed by a section supervisor and by a parole officer of the Victoria Parole Office, notes 3 institutional offence convictions described therein as "possession of contraband (marijuana) on two occasions and failing to obey an order." Nevertheless, the case management team, (with whom the applicant "was actively involved" according to paragraph 7 of the filed affidavit of Fraser Simmons, Regional Manager, Case Preparation for the respondent) articulately and strongly recommended that the applicant be accorded day parole.
