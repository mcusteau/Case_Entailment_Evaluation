Gibson, J.
: As indicated in the extended style of cause, these reasons arise out of an application for judicial review of a decision of Albert Burke, a member of the Public Service Staff Relations Board, (the "Tribunal") wherein the Tribunal, following a reference to adjudication pursuant to section 92 of the
Public Service Staff Relations Act
(the "
Act
"), determined the employer to have violated the collective agreement at issue and ordered the employer to grant one day of vacation leave to the respondent. The day of leave was to be at a time chosen by the respondent, and on reasonable notice to the employer, within a period of six months following the date of the Tribunal's decision. The employer was ordered not to deduct the day of leave from the respondent's accumulated vacation leave credits. The decision of the Tribunal is dated the 31st of May, 1996.
