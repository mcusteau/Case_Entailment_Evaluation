I turn next to the question of whether or not the remedy ordered by the Tribunal was punitive in nature. There can be no question that the Tribunal had the authority to impose a remedy against the employer in circumstances where it found the respondent to have suffered a loss. I am in agreement with counsel for the respondent that the principle against which such a remedy is to be determined is that the remedy chosen should, to the greatest extent possible, put the person suffering the damage or loss in the same position in which he or she would have found himself or herself absent the wrong committed. In reviewing a determination as to an appropriate remedy in the context of a breach of a collective agreement, absent a finding of jurisdictional error, would normally regard the standard of review as at or approaching that of reasonableness since the determination of an appropriate remedy in such a context is within the established role and expertise, or "home jurisdiction", of the Tribunal. See:

, supra, p. 404 [S.C.R.]. But where the remedy is punitive in nature, the order imposing the remedy can be "... properly found to be patently unreasonable." See
