The Associate Senior Prothonotary decided that most of the questions in this category need not be answered. This is in keeping with the decisions in
Rivtow Straits Ltd. v. B.C. Marine Shipbuilders Ltd.
, [1977] 1 F.C. 735; 14 N.R. 314 (F.C.A.) and
Geo Vann Inc.
, supra, especially at pp. 70-71. The questions require conjecture and speculation. They are not questions of knowledge, information or belief as to facts. The plaintiff does not appeal the prothonotary's decision that these questions need not be answered on discovery.
