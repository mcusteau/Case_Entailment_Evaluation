Questions that are vital to the final issues of a case are, for example, the entering of default judgment, [see footnote 3] a decision not to allow an amendment to pleadings, a decision to add additional defendants and thereby potentially reduce the liability of the existing defendant, [see footnote 4] or a decision on a motion for dismissal for want of prosecution [see footnote 5]. None of the questions raised by the present appeals with respect to the answering of questions on discovery can be characterized as vital to the final issues of the case.
