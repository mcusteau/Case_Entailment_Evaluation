Gulf States and Deco are two companies that made plates for Hallmark when Hallmark's manufacturing capacity was overburdened. Some of the plates so made were supplied to Coutts, and were part of the defendant's productions on discovery. The plaintiff only found out about the outsourcing during the course of discovery. The questions that the plaintiff sought to have answered were: whether Hallmark had knowledge of the method of manufacture used by Gulf States and Deco; how many such plates had been manufactured by a third party for Hallmark; when this was done, and what standards, if any, had been given by Hallmark to these manufacturers.
