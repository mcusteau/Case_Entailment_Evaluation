Gulf States and Deco are not parties to this action. The action relates to the infringement in Canada of the plaintiff's patents. Insofar as the activities of the defendant Hallmark are concerned the pleadings allege that Hallmark manufactured the plates in the United States and sold them in Canada to Coutts. The plaintiff alleges that Hallmark induced or procured infringement by Coutts, which infringement occurred as a result of the further sale of the plates by Coutts in Canada.
