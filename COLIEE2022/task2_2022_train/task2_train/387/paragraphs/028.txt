[28]
To the extent that the questions relate to the methods and manufacturing operations of the defendant's third party contractors, insofar as the defendant has knowledge of that and only with respect to the alleged infringing plates, I am of the view that the Associate Senior Prothonotary proceeded on the basis of a wrong principle. The questions are relevant to the issues of infringement, utility and the calculation of profits. Question 128 should be answered insofar as the defendant has knowledge, and, of course, only with respect to the plates that are alleged to infringe. Question 2088 should be answered. Questions 3270 - 71 should be answered, again, of course, only with respect to the alleged infringing plates and alleged infringing method. Questions 350-51 are in one sense too broad and when given a restricted interpretation duplicate Question 128. They need not be answered.
