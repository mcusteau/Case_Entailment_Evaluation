In seeking answers to questions concerning products other than plates, counsel for the plaintiff relies on the decision in
Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet Oy
(1992), 144 N.R. 389; 45 C.P.R.(3d) 116 (F.C.A.). In that case, questions relating to the profits arising from the sale of paper machines that contained the infringing press sections were held to be appropriate discovery questions. That decision is not relevant in the present case. Although the plates may, on some occasions, be packaged for sale together with cups, napkins and other products, the former are not an integral part of the latter and all are sold separately as well as being sold packaged together. The questions which the Associate Senior Prothonotary ordered answered, which it is alleged fall into the same category as those for which he refused to require an answer, differ from the latter in that they all relate to plates. I do not think that the questions that were ordered answered fall into the same category as those that were not.
