Counsel for the defendant argues that these questions are proper discovery questions because, when seeking an accounting of profits, as a remedy, the differential accounting method may be used; see
Teledyne Industries Inc. v. Lido Industrial Products Ltd.
(1982), 68 C.P.R.(2d) 204; 31 C.P.C. 285 (F.C.T.D.). There is no doubt the questions are proper with respect to an accounting of profits but they do require speculation and are of a type that, at trial, one would expect to be asked of witnesses having financial expertise concerning the company's affairs. That they are not questions of fact such as: Did you ever not supply Coutts with plates and then start up again? What new expenses occurred as a result of that event? The two questions are similar in nature to those that were not required to be answered. I conclude that the Associate Senior Prothonotary erred in principle in not including them in the category of questions to which answers were not required.
