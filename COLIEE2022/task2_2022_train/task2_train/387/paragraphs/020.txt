With respect to the argument that the information, which the questions seek, has already been disclosed, albeit in a cumbersome form, I do not think the defendant can refuse to answer, if it knows the answer. It cannot refuse to answer merely because the plaintiff has been given the invoices, which if searched through will disclose the answers. At the same time, if the defendant does not know the answers, I agree with counsel's submission that the defendant is not required, at this stage, to search through ten years of invoices in order to find the answers.
