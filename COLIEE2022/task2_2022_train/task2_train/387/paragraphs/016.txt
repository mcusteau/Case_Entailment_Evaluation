That commercial success is a proper area for discovery is clear; see
Corning Glass Works of Canada Ltd. v. Canada Wire and Cable Co.
, supra, at p. 109 and
Geo Vann Inc.
, supra, at p. 73. Also, in
Unilever plc et al. v. Procter & Gamble Inc. et al.
(1989), 24 C.P.R.(3d) 388; 23 C.I.P.R. 237 (F.C.T.D.), it was held that even though commercial success had not been expressly pleaded, questions on that subject related to a matter in issue and should be answered. The matter in issue is "obviousness". Obviousness had been pleaded by the defendants in their defence in the
Unilever
case and has been pleaded by the defendants in this action. The principle function of pleadings, as counsel notes, is to define with clarity the issues between the litigants and to give fair notice of the case that has to be met, so that the opposing party may direct evidence to those issues. Once a defendant pleads obviousness it will know that questions relating to commercial success are relevant. I do not think it is necessary for the plaintiff to expressly allege such in its reply pleading [see footnote 9].
