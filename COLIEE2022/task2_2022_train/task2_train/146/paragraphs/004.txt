  The neighbours heard the applicants' cries for help and called the police. The police did not come because they had no vehicle. After the gunmen left, the applicants' neighbours brought them to the station where they made a police report and subsequently received medical attention for their injuries.

The husband testified at the hearing that he did not know the outcome of that arrest, and that he had never followed up with the police about it.
