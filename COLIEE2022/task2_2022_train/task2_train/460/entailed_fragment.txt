In this case, the officer explicitly considered whether the evidence in the letters could have affected the outcome of the RPD hearing, and found that because they did not address the issue of whether the applicants had a viable IFA in Guadalaraja, they should be afforded little weight on the PRRA application. The same can be said of the police reports. I cannot conclude that this was unreasonable, nor can I conclude that this finding is related to the credibility of the documents themselves.
