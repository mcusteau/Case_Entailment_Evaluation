I take issue with the position of the Respondent in its memorandum of argument that a statement made by counsel can never be evidence and thus, presumably, can never be found to have any probative value. Legal counsel are officers of the Court with well established duties and responsibilities, including the responsibility not to misstate facts or mislead. In my view, statements of fact made by counsel may constitute evidence in informal proceedings such as a PRRA application and they may be given weight. In these instances, counsel is not the witness, it is counsel's client that is the effective witness - counsel is merely making a statement on the client's behalf.
