By letter dated July 25, 2007, Ms. Ferguson's former counsel wrote to the PRRA officer enclosing "the evidence being relied upon by the Applicant and submissions in support of her application". In addition to enclosing news articles, counsel provided a six-page document which appears to be the submissions referenced in the covering letter. Counsel writes:
Ms. Ferguson is lesbian and is very open about her sexual orientation. She believes that if removed to Jamaica, her life would be at risk, as a result of well-known incidences of homophobia and hate-crime violence in that country against members of her particular social group.
The only other reference to Ms. Ferguson's sexual orientation is found at the end of her former counsel's submissions where she writes:
Respecting the fact that the objective documentary evidence reveals the persecution of members of the Applicant's particular social group is commonplace in Jamaica, and the fact that Ms. Ferguson is very openly lesbian, counsel respectfully submits that there is a very serious possibility that the Applicant would be at risk should she return to her country of nationality.
