With respect, in my view, that form letter makes it clear that the submissions are to set out reasons and explanations -not evidence. Evidence to support the application ought to be contained in or referenced in the application. In this instance, the Applicant's statement on the face of her application that submissions were to follow may have been sufficient to alert the officer that those submissions might also contain evidence in addition to reasons and explanations. As will be discussed later, it is my view that there may be instances when statements from counsel may be considered to be evidence.
