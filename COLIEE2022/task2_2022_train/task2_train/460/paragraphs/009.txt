There was an issue raised by the Applicant in the pleadings regarding an alleged breach of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, S.C. 1960, c. 44; however, it was not pursued in oral argument and, in my view, was without merit. The sole issue in this proceeding is whether the PRRA officer erred in failing to consider conducting or in failing to conduct an oral hearing.
