Next, Mrs. Brovina argues that the RPD erred in relation to the burden of proof because it found that, on a balance of probabilities, there was not a serious possibility that Mrs. Brovina would be targeted for persecution. She submits that the burden to establish facts is the balance of probabilities, but the burden in terms of well-foundedness is serious grounds to consider (more than a mere possibility). It is alleged that the board also erred in relation to s. 97 in referring to a likelihood of risk. Section 96, it is said, arguably has a higher burden of proof than s. 97. The test for s. 96 is reasonable chance, but a mere risk is a lower threshold still. Furthermore, paragraphs 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) arguably do not have the same test since 97(1)(a) refers to risk of torture on substantial grounds, while 97(1)(b) refers only to risk.
