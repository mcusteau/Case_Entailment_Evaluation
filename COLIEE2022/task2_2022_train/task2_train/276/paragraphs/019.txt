Counsel for Mrs. Brovina suggested that if my decision in this matter turned on the standard of proof tests in paragraphs 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b), that the issue of the applicable standard would be one that is appropriate for certification. That is not the case. The respondent opposed certification on the basis that there is no factual foundation. I agree.
