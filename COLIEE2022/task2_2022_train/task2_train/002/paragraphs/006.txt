 [6] 
  In his oral submissions before this Court, the Applicant provided background information about the hearing before the Citizenship Judge and about contacts made by Citizenship and Immigration Officers with his landlords. The Applicant also gave explanations which addressed the problems the Citizenship Judge had identified with his documents and evidence. However, the Applicant acknowledged that the information in these submissions was not evidence and I have therefore not considered it in reaching this decision.
