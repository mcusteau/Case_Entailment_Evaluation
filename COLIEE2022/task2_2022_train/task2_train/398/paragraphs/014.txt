I conclude that the visa officer's failure to continue the assessment was a result of his interpretation that the legislation did not permit him to do so. As the officer stated in the letter received by the applicant:
"... I do not believe that your various responsibilities can be broken down into separate components for the purposes of awarding you units of assessment for experience in your alternative intended occupations ..."
Such an interpretation is a clear error of law. The Regulations permit the applicant to be assessed in "an occupation". The factors listed in column I of Schedule I require that the experience of the applicant be assessed with regard to his intended occupation. There is no reason why the actual experience and time spent in each of the various responsibilities in an occupation cannot be broken down to award units of assessment for experience in intended occupations. Paragraph 15 of the Baker affidavit, which I quoted previously, makes this quite clear.
