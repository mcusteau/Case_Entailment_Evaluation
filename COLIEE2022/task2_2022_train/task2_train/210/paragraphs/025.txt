  In the case at the bar, the applicant has relied upon medical records and a letter from Major Zaporzan testifying about the latter's awareness of a low back injury to the applicant. Taken together, there is evidence that the applicant injured his back in 1995/96 as a result of training for an EXPRESS fitness test and subsequently falling on his lower spine after being hit in an organized hockey game that was part of a Canadian Forces Command and Staff College event. This evidence is uncontradicted.
