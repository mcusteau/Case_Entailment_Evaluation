  I deal briefly with the issue of admissibility of the applicant's training and parachute jump log books addressed by counsel. On judicial review, a Court can consider only evidence that was before the administrative decision-maker whose decision is being reviewed and not new evidence (see  
 Brychka v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , supra;  
 Franz v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1995), 80 F.T.R. 79 (T.D.);  
 Via Rail Canada Inc. v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al. 
 , [1997] F.C.J. No. 1089; 135 F.T.R. 214 (T.D.);  
 Lemiecha et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1993), 72 F.T.R. 49; 24 Imm. L.R.(2d) 95 (T.D.);  
 Ismaili v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1995), 100 F.T.R. 139; 29 Imm. L.R.(2d) 1 (T.D.). In this case, the applicant sought to introduce records concerning his 28 parachute jumps and his running, providing further evidence to support his case. These records were not before the Board, or before the Entitlement Board which first considered his pension appeal. This Court takes no cognizance of this further evidence here offered for the purposes of this application for judicial review. The applicant may wish to consult the Board about tendering these records either for its consideration, or perhaps in relation to a new application for pension benefits to be considered first by an Entitlement Board.
