  The applicant submits that the Board did not expressly find the evidence presented lacked credibility, and yet it failed on the evidence to resolve the case in favour of the applicant, which, it is urged, under section 39 of the  
 Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act 
 , S.C. 1995, c. 18, is to be done whenever there is doubt about the validity of the veteran's claim. All of the evidence, medical and otherwise, counsel submits, establishes a link between the applicant's low back pain and his service related activities. The applicant's evidence regarding his training for the EXPRESS fitness test, his 28 parachute jumps and his hockey injury during a Canadian Forces Command and Staff College event were, submits counsel, sufficiently strenuous and service-related to warrant the granting of a disability pension.
