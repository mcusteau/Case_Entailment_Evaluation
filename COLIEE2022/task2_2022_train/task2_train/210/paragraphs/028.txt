 [28] 
  The Board may reject the applicant's evidence when it has before it contradictory medical evidence. However, while there may be an absence of evidence in the form of definitive medical documentation about the injury claimed, where there is no contradictory evidence and the Board does not accept the applicant's evidence without explanation of that, it commits an error that goes to jurisdiction (see  
 Moar v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1995), 103 F.T.R. 314 (T.D.)). A decision of the Board that errs in the exercise of its jurisdiction, is unreasonable and warrants intervention by the Court. The standard of patent unreasonableness, in my opinion, is not apt if the error concerns the exercise of the Board's jurisdiction.
