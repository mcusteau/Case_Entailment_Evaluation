Perhaps someday an applicant present in Canada will enjoy sufficient standing and possess sufficient determination to bring the same sort of application. It would be better that Â such person be a plaintiff instituting an action in the nature of a law suit leading to a trial, for the consent herein evinced might never be repeated. In the meanwhile, the applicant's claim must regrettably be dismissed in compliance with the Appeal Division's unanimous judgment in the Canadian Council of Churches decision, (1990) 106 N.R. 61. He is not liable to the respondents for their costs, despite the professional high quality of their counsel's performance. Both sides' counsel merit praise.
Application dismissed.
