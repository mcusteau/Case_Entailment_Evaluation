Neither speaker "speaks" law: it is Parliament (composed of Sovereign, Senate and Commons) which "enacts" law. Parliament should be taken to say what it means and to mean what it says, especially in this instance, since there is no cryptic or other ambiguity in the Act's text in this regard. Therefore, it is the provisions of s. 19(2)(a) as enacted, which govern here.
