Muldoon, J.
: This is a sad case for it appears that the applicant, his wife and child who would appear to be first-rate immigrants are delayed in their application for permanent residence in Canada because of an isolated lapse of no great moral turpitude in the applicant's otherwise apparently impeccable life's story. The court must dismiss his application with profound regret, because the only alternative would be the court's own complicity in a breach, albeit a compassionate breach, of the rule of law.
