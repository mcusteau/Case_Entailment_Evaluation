Even although the respondents have conceded that the requirements stated by Mr. Justice Mahoney for the Appeal Division of this Court in Wilson v. Minister of Justice, [1985] 1 F.C. 586; 60 N.R. 194, are met, and they concede that this application for declaratory relief should not be dismissed solely because it was not instituted by a statement of claim, that concession of progress does not spell the end of the hurdles facing the applicant. There is yet one further question of what might be said to be assimilated to standing, or the applicant's status to institute these proceedings. Consideration of that matter requires a short viewing of the progress of this litigation.
