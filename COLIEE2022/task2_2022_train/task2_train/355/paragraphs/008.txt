The applicant, however, is inflicted with a heavier "debt" than most other British citizens because he was in the process of immigrating, with his family, to Canada. It is Canadian law which imposes the further penalty, whereby the Act provides:
"19(2) No immigrant and, except as provided in subs. (3), no visitor shall be granted admission if he is a Â member of any of the following classes:
(a) persons who have been convicted of an offence that, if committed in Canada, constitutes, or if committed outside Canada, would constitute an offence that may be punishable by way of indictment under any other Act of Parliament and for which a maximum term of imprisonment of less than ten years may be imposed, except persons who have satisfied the Minister that they have rehabilitated themselves and that
(i) in the case of persons who were convicted of any such offence when they were twenty-one or more years of age, at least five years have elapsed since the termination of the sentence imposed for the offence, or
(ii) in the case of persons who were convicted of any such offence when they were less than twenty-one years of age, at least two years have elapsed since the termination of the sentence imposed for the offence."
It will be noted that as between subparagraphs (i) and (ii) there is a distinction, if not a discriminatory inequality, based on whether the subject be less than 21 years of age, or be that age or older.
