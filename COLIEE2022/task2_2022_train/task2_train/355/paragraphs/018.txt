[18]
In view of the general age of majority in both federal and provincial laws in Canada being set at 18 years of age, ss. 19(2)(a)(i) and (ii) draw a distinction between those adults who are between 18 and 21 years of age in subparagraph (i) and those adults who are 21 years of age or older in subparagraph (ii). The distinction, prescribed by the cited law, does not appear to be demonstrably justified in terms of s. 1 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Indeed the Crown, which here upholds those limits prescribed by law, fails to demonstrate the justification for such a sterile discrimination as between adult persons who are over the age of 18 years.
