At one point in the interview, the applicant was shown a telex which Immigration had received from the Canadian Employment and Immigration Commission regarding musicians which he interpreted as stating that only musicians enjoying international recognition would be considered for migration to Canada. After reading it, the applicant was informed by the visa officer that he "had a problem". The officer then left the room indicating he was going to consult with his superior and upon returning he stated the applicant's request for permanent residence in Canada had been denied. The applicant asked the officer to read over his business proposal since he was applying as a music teacher and had experience and offers to teach, but the officer replied this was not necessary as he was only interested in what the applicant had done in the past.
