Applications for permanent residence under the self-employed provisions of the Immigration Act and Regulations involve a two-stage assessment process. The first phase of the assessment is a paper screening process in which immigration officials evaluate documents submitted by applicants and decide if the application process should be continued. If the applicant passes this phase, he is invited to an interview with a visa officer. Obviously one of the most significant factors in any assessment is the applicant's possibility of supporting himself in Canada. Points are therefore awarded both for occupational demand in the paper screening step, and in the final assessment, for experience in the occupation for which the candidate is qualified and prepared to follow in Canada. Where an applicant is not awarded any units of assessment for experience, an immigrant visa cannot be issued unless the visa officer believes there are good reasons why the number of points do not reflect the chances of the applicant to become successfully established in Canada and those reasons have been approved by a senior immigration officer. A candidate for self-employment is also subject to the definition of a self-employed person in s. 2(1) of the Regulations and must be someone who intends and has the ability to establish or purchase a business in Canada that will create an employment opportunity for himself and will make a significant contribution to the economy or the cultural or artistic life of Canada. In addition, the visa officer will award 30 units of assessment to an applicant seeking to be self-employed if it is his opinion the applicant will be able to become successfully established in his business in Canada.
