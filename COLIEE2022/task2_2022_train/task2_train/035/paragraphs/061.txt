  On the basis of an affidavit filed on May 20, 2004, the Attorney General of Canada objected to the disclosure of the words "involved in terrorism activities" in paragraph 87.B on the ground of the third party rule. Concerning the other information in paragraph 87.B, the only privilege asserted at the outset of this proceeding was that disclosure would detrimentally affect the R.C.M.P.'s ongoing investigation in a matter relating to national security.
