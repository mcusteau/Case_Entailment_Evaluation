  As early as fifteen years ago, Justice George Addy, acting as a judge designated to hear national security matters, grappled with these competing interests in  
 Henrie v. Security Intelligence Review Committee et al. 
 , [1989] 2 F.C. 229; 24 F.T.R. 24; [1988] F.C.J. No. 965 (T.D.). In his analysis assessing the extent of any injury to national security as the result of the disclosure of sensitive information, Justice Addy differentiated between national security and criminal law investigations (at paragraphs 26 and 28): 
 
 
 
 "... one must bear in mind that the fundamental purpose of and indeed the raison d'Ãªtre of a national security intelligence investigation is quite different and distinct from one pertaining to criminal law enforcement, where there generally exists a completed offence providing a framework within the perimeters of which investigations must take place and can readily be confined. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "Criminal investigations are generally carried out on a comparatively short-term basis while security investigations are carried on systematically over a period of years, as long as there is a reasonable suspicion of the existence of activities which would constitute a threat to the security of the nation."
