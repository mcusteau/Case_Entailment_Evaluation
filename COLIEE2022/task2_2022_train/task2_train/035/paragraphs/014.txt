 [14] 
  During the hearings of July 2005, this Court received ex parte evidence from witnesses for the Attorney General of Canada as to whether the disclosure of the names would be injurious to Canada's international relations or national security. From July 12 through 14, 2005, three affiants testified on this issue. It became apparent to the Court that one government institution no longer objected to the disclosure of the names and that at least one other government institution continued to object.
