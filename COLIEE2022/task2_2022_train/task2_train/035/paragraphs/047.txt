  I have also kept in mind the public process before Justice Dorval. It was one which did not allow for the presentation of the evidence this Court received in ex parte sessions. Also, the representations before Justice Dorval were generic and without reference to any of the particular passages in Appendix D. It was only after Justice Dorval determined which information she would unseal that the Attorney General of Canada could address in a specific way the national security issues which were of concern.
