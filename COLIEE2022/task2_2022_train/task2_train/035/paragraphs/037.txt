 [37] 
  Subsequent to October 10, 2006, I was of the view that the disclosure of the information related to the Durno orders would no longer be injurious to international relations or national security and that, in any event, the public interest in the openness of court proceedings outweighed the importance of the public interest in non-disclosure. On November 20, 2006, during a conference call among all parties, counsel for the Attorney General of Canada advised that a substantial portion of the information related to the Durno orders was not likely to be disclosed pursuant to subsection 38.03. This position differed from my view.
