 [15] 
  On July 14, 2005, at a session involving all counsel, I expressed my preference for Justice Dorval to indicate specifically which names she intended to have disclosed. The designation of other entities and addresses in the search warrants required, in my view, this greater clarity. To this end, with the cooperation of counsel, this Court issued the following direction on July 14, 2005: 
 
 
 
 "This Court has been requested by the applicants, pursuant to ss. 38.04 and 38.06 of the  
 Canada Evidence Act 
 , to authorize the disclosure of the information which Justice Dorval was prepared to unseal in her decision of June 24, 2005 ('the information'). 
 
 
 
 "The Court is adjourning this issue sine die to await a decision from Judge Dorval on whether she would unseal the names of persons in these six search warrants in light of the Ontario Court of Appeal's decision dated June 3rd, 2005, and the Court of Appeal's Addendum issued June 9th, 2005."
