  In this proceeding, I have also been guided by the decisions of Justice Dorval. On December 17, 2004, she concluded that the investigation, which led the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to seek the search warrants in January 2002, was still ongoing. She accepted that the sealing order was required with respect to some material in order to protect the nature and extent of the ongoing investigation. Nevertheless, she found that a portion of the documents in issue should be made public.
