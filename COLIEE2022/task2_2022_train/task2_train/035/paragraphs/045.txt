 [45] 
  One year later, in  
 Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd. 
 , the Supreme Court of Canada considered sealing orders concerning search warrants in a criminal investigation with no national security implications. Justice Morris Fish once again reiterated the importance of the open court principle (at paragraph 7): 
 
 
 
 "... In my view, the  
 Dagenais/Mentuck 
  test applies to  
 all 
  discretionary court orders that limit freedom of expression and freedom of the press in relation to legal proceedings. Any other conclusion appears to me inconsistent with an unbroken line of authority in this Court over the past two decades. And it would tend to undermine the open court principle inextricably incorporated into the core values of s. 2(b) of the  
 Charter
