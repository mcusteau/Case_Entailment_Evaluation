The applicant's submissions state that she faces a potential risk to her life, inhumane treatment or extreme sanctions if returned to the PRC because she illegally exited China. She notes that there are penalties in place in the PRC for persons who exit the country illegally, including incarceration for extended periods of time under deplorable conditions, beatings and fines. Her submissions emphasize the point that, while these penalties may not have been strictly enforced in the past, they will be enforced in her case because the Chinese government suffered international embarrassment over the "boat people" incident. She states that since it is the central Chinese government that will be punishing her upon her return, there is no internal flight alternative. She submits that she faces further risks because of her and her family's practice of Christianity and because she has had more than one child.
