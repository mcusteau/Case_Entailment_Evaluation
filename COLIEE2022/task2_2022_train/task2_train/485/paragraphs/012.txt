Subsequently, McKeown, J., faced the same issue in
Mia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.T.R. Uned. 728; [2001] F.C.J. 1854 (T.D.). McKeown, J., however, was of the opinion that the duty of fairness does not require disclosure of the risk assessment by the PCDO. He addressed the holding in
Soto
, supra, as follows at paragraph 11:
"With respect, I disagree that the principles of fairness require a PCDO conducting a risk assessment to determine if the applicant is a member of the PDRCC class to disclose the risk assessment prior to making his decision. In my view, this would be tantamount to a decision-maker being required to provide its reasons for the decision for comment prior to making the final decision. This is a case where the person who reviewed the evidence made the decision. No one else was involved. This is not a case where the decision maker is receiving input from other persons than the applicant. Further, I note that
Haghighi
dealt with an application under humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Thus there was no reviewable error on this issue."
