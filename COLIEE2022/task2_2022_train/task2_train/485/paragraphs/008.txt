The PCDO concluded as follows:
"I note that documentation on China indicates that human rights conditions are not very favourable, but this in itself is not sufficient to find the applicant at risk. There must be a link between the individual's case and above. There is insufficient information between her own particular situation and China's country conditions to support that she would be specifically targeted or subjected to an objectively identifiable risk if she returned to China.
"DECISION:
"Based on the evidence before me, I do not see a reasonable possibility the applicant would be at risk should she be removed to China. The applicant is not a member of the PDRCC class."
