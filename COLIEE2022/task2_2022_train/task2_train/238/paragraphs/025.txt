In determining whether there is a likelihood of confusion between the parties' trademarks, I have examined the respondent's mark, which is a design mark, and compared it to the applicant's mark as it is currently being used in its printed advertisements. It is well established that in evaluating the "degree of resemblance" between two marks, the test must be taken from the point of view of a person who has only a general and not a precise recollection of the earlier mark (
Oshawa Group Ltd. v. Registrar of Trademarks and Creative Resources Co. Ltd.
(1982), 46 N.R. 426; 61 C.P.R.(2d) 29, at p. 35 (F.C.A.)). Given the high degree of visual similarity between the marks as they are currently being used (see a reproduction of the marks below) and applying the above test, I must conclude that there is a likelihood of confusion between the two marks.
