[11]
The sole issue to be determined in this appeal is whether or not the appellant's trademark is "confusing" with the respondent's registered trademark. The question of whether it is confusing or not is to be determined with reference to the standard established by s. 6(2) of the
Act
which provides as follows:
"6(2) The use of a trademark causes confusion with another trademark if the use of both trademarks in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares or services associated with such trademarks are manufactured, sold, leased, hired or performed by the same person, whether or not such wares or services are of the same general class."
Included in the circumstances to be considered in determining the issue of confusion, are the factors enumerated at s. 6(5) of the
Act
which reads as follows:
"6(5) In determining whether trademarks or trade names are confusing, the court or the Registrar, as the case may be, shall have regard to all the surrounding circumstances including
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks or trade names and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trademarks or trade names have been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks or trade names in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them."
