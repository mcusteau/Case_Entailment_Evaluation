In his decision dated November 30, 1989, David J. Martin refused the appellant's application to register the trademark MITAC, for use in association with computers and computer products, on the ground that there would be a likelihood of confusion with the respondent's registered trademark MITA when used in association with copying machines and associated products. In his reasons for judgment, Mr. Martin emphasized that the appellant's mark had become known in Canada to a much lesser extent than the respondent's mark. He also stated that the wares of both parties were similar in that they both could be classified as office equipment, thus creating a potential overlap in the markets for the parties' products. With reference to s. 6(5)(e) of the
Act
, Mr. Martin pointed to the high degree of visual resemblance between the two marks, particularly when one compared the design version employed by the appellant with the opponent's mark as registered and used. Mr. Martin also added that there was fair degree of potential similarity between the marks when sounded, emphasizing the lack of evidence to support the appellant's contrary characterization.
