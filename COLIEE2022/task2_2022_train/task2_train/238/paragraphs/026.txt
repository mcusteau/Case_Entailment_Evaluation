Although counsel for the appellant argued that the respondent's mark MITA, said to be pronounced "MEE TAH", differs in sound from the appellant's coined trademark MITAC, properly pronounced "MY TAK" as it was derived from the words "
mi
cro processors" and "
T
aiwan
A
utomation
C
ompany", the appellant failed to adduce any evidence with respect to the proper pronunciation of the respondent's mark. In addition, the appellant did not present any evidence indicating that the public had been educated to pronounce either of the marks in any specific manner. Consequently, it is my opinion that the appellant did not discharge its onus with respect to the likelihood of confusion between the marks when they are sounded.
CONCLUSION:
