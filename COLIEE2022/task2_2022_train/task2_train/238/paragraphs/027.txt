[27]
I must conclude that the appellant did not discharge its onus of proving that Mr. Martin erred in his decision of November 30, 1989. After reviewing the evidence before this court in light of the circumstances enumerated in s. 6(5) of the
Act
, it is my opinion that the appellant did not meet the onus of establishing its right to registrability.
