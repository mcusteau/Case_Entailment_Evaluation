[8]
A notice of appeal was filed on January 29, 1990, in which the appellant alleged a number of errors said to have been made by the Trademarks Opposition Board in its decision of November 30, 1989. Since the appellant adopted a different approach in his pleadings before this court than he did in his notice of appeal, I will not enumerate the various alleged errors. Rather, I will later consider them in light of the surrounding circumstances which are to be examined in determining whether trademarks are confusing, as this was the approach taken by counsel for the appellant.
