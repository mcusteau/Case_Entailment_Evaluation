  The Federal Court of Appeal in  
 ITV Technologies Inc. v. WIC Television Ltd. 
  (2001), 199 F.T.R. 319 (F.C.A.), leave to appeal dismissed, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 156; 276 N.R. 195 (S.C.C.), affirmed that the principles which apply on a motion for summary judgment are those set out in  
 Granville Shipping Co. v. Pegasus Lines Ltd. S.A. et al. 
 , [1996] 2 F.C. 853; 111 F.T.R. 189 (T.D.). Those principles, as relevant to this motion, are: 
 
 
 
 1. The purpose of summary judgment is to allow the court to summarily dispense with cases which ought not to proceed to trial because there is no genuine issue to be tried. 
 
 
 
 2. There is no determinative test. It is not whether a party cannot possibly succeed at trial, it is whether the case is so doubtful that it does not deserve consideration by the trier of fact at a future trial. 
 
 
 
 3. Each case should be interpreted in reference to its own contextual framework. 
 
 
 
 4. This court may determine questions of fact and law on a motion for summary judgment if this can be done on the material before the court. 
 
 
 
 5. On the whole of the evidence, summary judgment cannot be granted if the necessary facts cannot be found, or if it would be unjust to do so. 
 
 
 
 6. In the case of a serious issue with respect to credibility, the case should go to trial because the witnesses should be cross-examined before the trial judge. The mere existence of apparent conflict in the evidence does not preclude summary judgment. The court should take a "hard look" at the merits and decide if there are issues of credibility to be resolved.
