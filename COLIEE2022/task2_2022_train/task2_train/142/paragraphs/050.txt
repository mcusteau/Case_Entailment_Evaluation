 [50] 
  Counsel for the Minister did not strenuously assert a claim for costs. In circumstances where this is one of the first cases where summary judgment has been sought in a citizenship revocation proceeding, in the exercise of my discretion I determine that each party should bear their own costs. There will be no order as to costs.
