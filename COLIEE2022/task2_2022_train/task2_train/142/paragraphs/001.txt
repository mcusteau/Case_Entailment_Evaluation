 Dawson, J. 
 : By notice dated January 14, 2002 the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration ("Minister") notified the defendant, Mr. Schneeberger, of the Minister's intention to make a report to the Governor-in-Council, pursuant to subsections 10(1) and 18(1) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 (" 
 Act 
 "). The notice alleges that the defendant suppressed facts between the time he applied for citizenship and the time it was granted which, if known, would have warranted denial of his citizenship. If the Governor-in-Council becomes satisfied of this, the defendant would cease to be a Canadian citizen. In consequence, as was his right, the defendant requested that the matter be referred to this court. The Minister then commenced this action by statement of claim and the defendant filed a statement of defence. The Minister now moves for summary judgment declaring that the defendant has obtained his Canadian citizenship by false representation or fraud or by knowingly concealing material circumstances.
