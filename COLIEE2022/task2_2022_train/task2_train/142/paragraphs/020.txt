 [20] 
  In  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Odynsky 
  (2001), 196 F.T.R. 1; 14 Imm. L.R.(3d) 3 (T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay considered the meaning of the phrase "knowingly concealing material circumstances" as used in section 10 of the  
 Act 
 . He concluded, at paragraph 159, that the phrase requires that: 
 
 
 
 "[...] the court must find on evidence, and/or reasonable inference from the evidence, that the person concerned concealed circumstances material to the decision, whether he knew or did not know that they were material, with the intent of misleading the decision-maker."
