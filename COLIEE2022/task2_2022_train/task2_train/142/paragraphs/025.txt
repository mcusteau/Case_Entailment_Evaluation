  The standard of proof to be applied in a reference under the  
 Act 
  is the civil standard of proof on a balance of probabilities. However, the evidence must be scrutinized with greater care because of the seriousness of the allegations and the severe consequences of revocation of citizenship. See:  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Coomar 
  (1998), 159 F.T.R. 37 (T.D.), at paragraph 10.
