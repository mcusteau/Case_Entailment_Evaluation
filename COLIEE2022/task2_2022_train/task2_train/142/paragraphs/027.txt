 [27] 
  The Citizenship Judge who allowed the defendant's application for citizenship swore an affidavit in this proceeding in which she waives any claim to privilege that she may have in her capacity as a former Citizenship Judge. She swears to having a clear recollection of the defendant's interview. She says that, in accordance with her usual practice, she asked the defendant whether he had been under a past or present criminal investigation. She swears that her exact words were "have you ever in the past or are you presently under any kind of criminal investigation past or present?" She swears that the defendant answered "no" to that question. The Citizenship Judge further swears that if the defendant had answered "yes" to the question, she would not have allowed him to sign the attestation or to take the oath of citizenship. She would have inquired as to what kind of offence was being investigated, since being charged with an indictable offence would have prohibited the defendant from taking the oath and becoming a citizen.
