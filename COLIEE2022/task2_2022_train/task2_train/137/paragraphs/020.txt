  The respondents give two reasons for the delay. First, they were trying to find a witness from the RCMP to testify at Mr Fabbiano's hearing. This person was identified in the summer of 2009. Second, officials were preoccupied with the arrival on Canada's west coast of the MV Ocean Lady and the MV Sun Sea in October 2009 and the summer of 2010 respectively. None of this delay, of course, could be attributed to Mr Fabbiano.
