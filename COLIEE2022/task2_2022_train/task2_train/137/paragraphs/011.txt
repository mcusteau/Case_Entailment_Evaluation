  Here, Mr Fabbiano's claim of an abuse of process stems from his contention that he should have been given a chance to update his submissions prior to the Minister's delegate's decision, and that the delay in communicating the decision to him (from 2009 to 2013) caused him significant harm. In fact, between 2006 and 2013, he heard nothing about the possibility that he might be inadmissible to Canada.
