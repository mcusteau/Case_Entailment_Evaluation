  In 2008, sixteen months after Mr Fabbiano had made submissions to the CBSA on the subject of his admissibility, an enforcement officer recommended that Mr Fabbiano be referred for an admissibility hearing (relying on s 44(1) of IRPA). A senior CBSA analyst concurred with that recommendation. In 2009, a delegate of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness referred Mr Fabbiano for an admissibility hearing (under s 44(2) of IRPA). Mr Fabbiano did not learn of any of these decisions until 2013. By way of this application for judicial review, Mr Fabbiano challenges the Minister's delegate's decision.
