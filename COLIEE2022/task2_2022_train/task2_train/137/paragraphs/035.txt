 [35] 
  The delay in dealing with the question of Mr Fabbiano's possible inadmissibility to Canada was oppressive and occasioned an abuse of process. I must, therefore, allow this application and order that the inadmissibility proceedings relating to Mr Fabbiano be permanently stayed. Any submissions relating to a question of general importance should be filed within 10 days of this judgment.
