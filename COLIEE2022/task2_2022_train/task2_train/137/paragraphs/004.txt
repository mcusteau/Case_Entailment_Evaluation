  Mr Fabbiano argues that the delay in notifying him of the delegate's decision constitutes an abuse of process. Further, he alleges that the proceedings are abusive because they were commenced as a form of reprisal for his refusal to act as an RCMP informant. He also claims that he was treated unfairly, and that the delegate's decision was unreasonable. He asks me to stay the admissibility proceedings, or to quash the decision and order another delegate to reconsider the question of his admissibility to Canada.
