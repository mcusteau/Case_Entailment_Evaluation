  The role of the Minister's delegate is to consider the evidence relevant to admissibility, and to exercise his or her discretion in the circumstances, which may include H&C factors ( 
 Faci v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 
 , 2011 FC 693, at para 31). The latter are more significant in cases involving persons, like Mr Fabbiano, who are long-term permanent residents of Canada. According to departmental guidelines, a delegate should consider the person's age, the duration of his or her residence in Canada, family circumstances, conditions in the person's country of origin, the degree of the person's establishment in Canada, the person's criminal history, and his or her attitude (see Citizenship and Immigration Canada, "ENF 6 - Review of reports under A44(1)" at 19.2).
