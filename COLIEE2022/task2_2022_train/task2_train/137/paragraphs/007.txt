  In her August 2008 report, the officer reviewed Mr Fabbiano's personal history, his family circumstances, his letters of reference, and the criminal activities of the Hells Angels. Most importantly, the officer relied on the evidence of four law enforcement agents who stated that Mr Fabbiano was a member of the Hells Angels. Based on that evidence, she recommended that Mr Fabbiano be referred for an admissibility hearing because he was a member of a criminal organization. On January 19, 2009, the senior analyst agreed, citing much of the same information, and requested that the matter be forwarded to a delegate of the Minister for a final decision. The next day, the delegate decided to refer Mr Fabbiano's file for an admissibility hearing. As mentioned, Mr Fabbiano received the decision in 2013.
