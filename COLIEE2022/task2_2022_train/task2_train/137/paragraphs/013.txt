  The purpose of the proceedings involving Mr Fabbiano was to take steps towards his removal from Canada based on his alleged membership in a criminal organization. For a person such as Mr Fabbiano, who has lived in Canada for more than 50 years and has raised a family here, these proceedings obviously involve potentially drastic consequences for him and his relatives. Similarly, from the perspective of the public interest, membership in a criminal organization, while not in itself a crime, is clearly a serious matter, evidenced by the grave immigration consequences that can ensue. Both of these purposes suggest that a high degree of care should be taken in arriving at a decision affecting a person in Mr Fabbiano's circumstances.
