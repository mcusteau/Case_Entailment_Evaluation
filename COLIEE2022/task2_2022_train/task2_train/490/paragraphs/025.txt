[25]
The questions suggested by the plaintiffs for certification do not meet the tests laid down by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Liyanagamage v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1994), 176 N.R. 4 (F.C.A.), in this regard, I entirely concur with the written submissions of counsel for the defendant on February 13, 2003, who proposed no questions for certification. Accordingly, no question is certified.
Application allowed in part.
