[21]
At page 1 of its decision the IRB indicated that the plaintiffs had objected to a particular question put by the Minister's representative to the Belgian Embassy, a question contained in Exhibit M-21. The objection was taken [Translation] "under advisement", but the IRB considered that it was no longer necessary to decide it since the exclusion clause did not apply to Belgium. If the objection was against production of the document the IRB erred by relying on Exhibit M-21 at page 7 of its decision. However, even if the IRB erred, the error is not fatal to its decision as Exhibit M-21 was not in any way used to support any of the reasons for its decision.
