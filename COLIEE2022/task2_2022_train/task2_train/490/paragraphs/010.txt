The IRB found that during their stay in Cameroon the plaintiffs had the rights set out above. With the valid residency card and an exit visa, the plaintiffs were entitled to return to Cameroon in the event of a temporary departure, as appears in Cameroon law. Also, the female plaintiff had no problems with employment: she worked almost continuously in her professional field of an examiner until she left Cameroon. The children were able to study at school without difficulty. The IRB also relied on the documentary evidence in finding that the plaintiffs had the right to use the social services, a finding not disputed by them.
