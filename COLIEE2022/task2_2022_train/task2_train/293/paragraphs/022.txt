In its classification grievance decision, the Committee rated the four factors specified in the Social Science Support group rating plan: Skill and Knowledge; Problem Solving; Responsibility for Contacts; and Supervision. While these factors do not cover all aspects of the job description, the Committee did not err by failing to award points to other unlisted factors. In respect of the factors to be awarded credit, the rating plan states in material part as follows:
"[...] The combined factors do not describe all aspects of jobs. They deal only with those characteristics that can be defined and distinguished and that are useful in determining the relative values of jobs.
"Four factors are used in this plan, two of which have more than one dimension and are defined in terms of two elements, and two of which are single-element factors."
The four factors cited above are the only factors that had to be evaluated as part of the Committee's classification decision.
