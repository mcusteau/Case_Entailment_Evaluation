There is nothing in the record to suggest that management's answers gave rise to a new consideration central to the Decision that the Applicant was not given the opportunity to speak to. The Decision reveals that management indicated:
"[...] that the outputs (benefit rate tables) were reviewed and approved by both himself and the Director prior to their being released for use within the program or to other interested parties, including other Federal Ministers."
There is no evidence before the Court that the approval of benefit rate tables was central to the Decision that the Applicant's position remain classified in the SI group. Nor is there evidence that the Applicant was denied an opportunity to make submissions to the Committee regarding his output rates.
