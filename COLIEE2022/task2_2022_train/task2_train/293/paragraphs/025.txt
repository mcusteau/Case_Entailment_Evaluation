It is common ground that after the Applicant's retirement the function of developing and maintaining mathematical models to establish OAS and CPP benefit rates was reassigned to an ES position. Nor does the Respondent take issue with the Applicant's evidence that a previous decision of a Classification Officer effective December 13, 2000 amended his work description to replace responsibility for developing mathematical models with maintaining spreadsheet applications. The Applicant submits that the Committee awarded his position the same points for Skill and Knowledge and Problem Solving (166 and 187, respectively) as were awarded to his position by the Classification Officer on December 13, 2000, at which time the development of mathematical models was no longer included in the work description.
