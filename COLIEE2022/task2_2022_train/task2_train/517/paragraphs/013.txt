In this same affidavit the visa officer also said, after concluding that Mr. Madan's duties did not appear to be those of a financial manager,
"I compared that definition [of the duties of a financial manager] with the one of accountant (NOC 1111) and found that the experience of the applicant corresponds to the one of accountant. However, neither the applicant or his counsel required that the application be reviewed for the requirement of accountant. Nor is a financial manager a related occupation to an accountant."
In other words, the visa officer did not assess the applicant as an accountant because he had not been asked to do so and the occupation of accountant is not a related occupation to that of financial manager.
