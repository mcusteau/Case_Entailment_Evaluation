In Henoud, above, Madam Justice Johanne Gauthier took a slightly different approach in considering the citizenship judgeâ€™s comment to the affect that the applicant had not provided any evidence that special circumstances existed that would justify recommending the exercise of ministerial discretion. Justice Gauthier concluded that when the citizenship judge stated that there was no evidence, he meant that there was no evidence that could prompt the citizenship judge to make such a recommendation, as opposed to there being no evidence that was presented by the applicant.
