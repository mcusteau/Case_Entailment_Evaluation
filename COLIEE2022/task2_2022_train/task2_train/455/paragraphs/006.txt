A number of judgments from the Federal Court have considered the proper standard of review for a decision of a citizenship judge, in light of the test set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Dr. Q. v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226. The general consensus has been that reasonableness simpliciter is the proper standard of review, as I myself noted in El Fihri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1106.
