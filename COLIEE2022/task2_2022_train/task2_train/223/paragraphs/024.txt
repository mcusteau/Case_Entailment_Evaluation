 [24] 
  Sections 3 and 39 of the  
 Act 
  do not, however, relieve the applicant of the burden of proving that his low back pain arose out of or in connection with military service ( 
 Cundell v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [2000] F.C.J. No. 38; 180 F.T.R. 193 (T.D.)). The applicant must still establish on a balance of probabilities, with the evidence considered in the best light possible, that his disability is service-related. This civil standard must be read in concert with the entitling provision of paragraph 21(2)(a) of the  
 Pension Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. P-7, which reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 "21(2) In respect of military service rendered in the non-permanent active militia or in the reserve army during World War II and in respect of military service in peace time, 
 
 
 
 (a) where a member of the forces suffers disability resulting from an injury or disease or an aggravation thereof that arose out of or was directly connected with such military service, a pension shall, on application, be awarded to or in respect of the member in accordance with the rates for basic and additional pension set out in Schedule I;"
