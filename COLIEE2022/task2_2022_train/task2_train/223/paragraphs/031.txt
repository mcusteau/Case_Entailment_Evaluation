  Regarding the letter of Major Zaporzan, I am not persuaded by the respondent's argument that it is clear that the Board attached little weight to its contents because Major Zaporzan is not a physician and could not diagnose the applicant. The mere fact that Major Zaporzan is not a physician is not a reason to disregard his general observations regarding the applicant's injury in terms of its effect and incidence. In any event, the Board did not articulate in its reasons why it did not give weight to the evidence submitted by Major Zaporzan.
