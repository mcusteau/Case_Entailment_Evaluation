Rule 8(1) would appear to give me the authority to abridge terms set by an order to file a statement of defence or to present a motion to strike a statement of claim. However, a party asking a court to expedite matters (i.e. abridgement of the times for taking certain steps) should show some sense of urgency or other reasons justifying such an order (See
Potato Board (P.E.I.) v. Canada (Minister of Agriculture)
[see footnote 1]). In the present motion a review of the material filed and referred to does not show such reasons or urgency.
