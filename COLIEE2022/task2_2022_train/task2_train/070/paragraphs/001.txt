 Phelan, J. 
 : In this Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) decision concerning a 62 year old citizen of Eritrea, the Officer reached three critical conclusions: (1) that conscription including that of children in Eritrea ceased in 2000; (2) that certain letters submitted carried no weight where they corroborated the Applicant but wee credible if they undermined the Applicant's position; (3) that the Applicant was not entitled to a hearing under s. 167 of the Immigration Regulations.
