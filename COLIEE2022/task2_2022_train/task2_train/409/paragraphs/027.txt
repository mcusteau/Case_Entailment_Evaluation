In these circumstances, I am satisfied that the effect of the various errors committed by Mr. Jesuorobo and his employeeswas to deny Ms. Osagie natural justice in relation to her abandonment hearing. In these circumstances, and having regard to the mandatory language of Rule 55(4) of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, Ms. Osagie's request to re-open her claim should have been granted. As a result, the decision of the Board on the application to re-open must be set aside.
