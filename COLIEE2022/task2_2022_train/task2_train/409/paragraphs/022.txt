[22]
I agree with the respondent that there are problems with the materials filed in this matter. In addition to the concern identified by the respondent, I am also concerned that much of the evidence contained in the affidavits sworn by Ms. Osagie, both in connection with the application to re-open her refugee claim and in relation to this application for judicial review, is based on information received by Ms. Osagie from Mr. Jesuorobo. This puts Mr. Jesuorobo in the position of arguing, at least indirectly, on the basis of his own evidence. As has been repeatedly noted by this Court, such conduct is contrary to the spirit of Rule 82 of the
Federal Court Rules
: See, for example,
Reading & Bates Construction Co. v. Baker Energy Resources Co., Baker Marine Co. and Gaz Inter-Cité Québec Inc.
(1986), 7 F.T.R. 117 (T.D.), and
Anwar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1441; 260 F.T.R. 261 (F.C.).
