That said, Ms. Osagie has provided direct evidence as to her state of awareness regarding the progress of her refugee claim. Her evidence as to what she was aware of and when she was aware of it is uncontroverted. Ms. Osagie has also provided first-hand information as to her intentions regarding her refugee claim. In this regard, the uncontradicted evidence before the Board on the motion to re-open was that Ms. Osagie completed her PIF within the specified time period, and was led by her counsel to believe that the form would be filed with the Immigration and Refugee Boardwithin the requisite 28-day period. Through no fault on the part of Ms. Osagie, this was not done, nor was she ever made aware of the fact that it was not done.
