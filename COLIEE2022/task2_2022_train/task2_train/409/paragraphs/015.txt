Mr. Jesuorobo further submits that even if one proceeds on the basis that his office had notice of the abandonment hearing on June 6, 2003, given that there was a weekend intervening, it was ridiculous to think that he could have made other arrangements before the following Monday morning. Once again, the Board was entitled to weigh the explanation provided for the failure to appear for the abandonment hearing, and I see no basis to interfere with the Board's finding that alternate arrangements could have been made. At the very least, Mr. Jesuorobo could have arranged for Ms. Osagie herself to attend at the abandonment hearing, to have her ask that the matter be adjourned in light of the unavailability of her counsel.
Did the Errors on the Part of Mr. Jesuorobo and His Office Result in Ms. Osagie Being Denied Natural Justice?
