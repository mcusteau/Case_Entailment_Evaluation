Ms. Osagie was represented at the hearing of her application for judicial review by the same counsel who represented her before the Board. Counsel initially advanced two arguments as to why the Board's decision should be set aside: first, that inadequate notice had been provided with respect to the scheduling of the abandonment hearing, which amounted to a breach of natural justice, and second, that the Board erred in failing to consider Ms. Osagie's request to have her abandonment hearing adjourned.
