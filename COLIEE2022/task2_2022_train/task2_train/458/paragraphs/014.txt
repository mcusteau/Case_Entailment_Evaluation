The adversarial nature of the proceedings in this case have been described in
Wiebe v. Public Service Commission (Appeal Board) (Can.)
, [1992] 2 F.C. 592; 141 N.R. 387 (C.A.), wherein Hugessen, J.A., stated at page 595 (F.C.):
"Proceedings under s. 21, though styled an 'inquiry', are very much adversarial in nature, with the applicant and the employer each being on opposite sides of the question and each generally being represented by persons experienced in this specialized type of dispute. The situation was aptly described by Cattanach, J., in the Trial Division [
Millward v. Public Service Commission
, [1974] 2 F.C. 530, at p. 539] as follows:
'While there is not a lis inter parties [sic] in the true sense of that term, there is, nevertheless, a contest between two parties. The deputy head is before the board to justify that the selection of the successful candidate was on the basis of the merit system and the unsuccessful candidate is present to establish that this was not the case. Such situation has been described and established by authority as a quasi-lis between quasi-parties.'"
In such adversarial proceedings, parties are entitled to be represented. Such representation must be effective, in the sense that counsel or representative must have an opportunity of knowing what evidence will be given by the witnesses that he or she will call. He or she must have the opportunity of reviewing the evidence of the expert witness, of organizing the evidence, of ensuring that the evidence is coherent, of emphasizing its best features and of preparing the witness for cross-examination. These are the normal functions of counsel. Without access to all relevant information and in particular, the confidential information upon which the expert evidence would be based and upon which the witness could be cross-examined, counsel or a representative cannot properly perform the task of persuading the court or tribunal as to the merits of the client's case.
