A difficulty that arises in proceedings in which confidential information is to be disclosed on a limited basis, is the accountability of the recipients of the information to ensure adherence to the requirement that the information they receive remains confidential. For example, are there sanctions that can be imposed upon recipients of confidential information for unauthorized disclosure of the information? Does the tribunal conducting the proceedings have the power to cite for contempt? Are the persons to whom disclosure is made members of a professional society which may discipline members for breach of ethics? These considerations are not, of course, exhaustive. However, they are some of the issues that a tribunal will consider when exercising its discretion as to who may receive disclosure of confidential information. Moreover, it must be remembered that in labour-management proceedings, representatives are not always lawyers. That fact alone cannot automatically disqualify them from receiving confidential information.
