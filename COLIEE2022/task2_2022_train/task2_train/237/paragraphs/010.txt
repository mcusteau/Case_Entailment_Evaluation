[10]
I will allow this appeal because the citizenship judge failed to consider whether Mr. Dedaj had met the residency requirement by having established and maintained his residency in Canada for the required period, even if he was not physically present in Canada for all of the 1,095 days. I will return the matter to another citizenship judge to reassess Mr. Dedaj's application.
