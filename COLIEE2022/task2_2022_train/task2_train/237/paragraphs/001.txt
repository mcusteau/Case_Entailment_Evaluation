O'Reilly, J.
: Mr. Toni Dedaj applied for Canadian citizenship in 2007. He thought he had the exact minimum number of days of residency in Canada required by the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29. The
Act
obliges applicants to live in Canada for three out of the four preceding years - 1,095 days. Mr. Dedaj thought he met that threshold, but a citizenship judge disagreed. She found that he was a couple of days short and dismissed his application. Mr. Dedaj appeals.
