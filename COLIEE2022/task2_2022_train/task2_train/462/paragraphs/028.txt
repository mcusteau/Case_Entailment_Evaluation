I will start by confirming that the Veterans Appeal Board decision should be quashed. The second decision of the Commission, which simply modified the location of the Special Duty Area, is not being challenged by the parties.

Chandler v. Alberta Association of Architects
, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 848; 99 N.R. 277; 101 A.R. 321; 70 Alta. L.R.(2d) 193; 62 D.L.R.(4th) 577, at p. 860, that is where there had been a slip in drawing it up, or where there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court.
