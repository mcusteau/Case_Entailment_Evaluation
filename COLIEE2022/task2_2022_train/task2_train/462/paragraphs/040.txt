Marceau, J.'s, decision was confirmed by a majority of the Federal Court of Appeal, but later reversed by the Supreme Court of Canada. In a very brief judgment, that court found that the link between the damage suffered by the appellant and his status as a servicemen was "too tenuous for one to say that the damage is connected to his military service". Nevertheless, the court confirmed the liability issue and awarded damages to the appellant at the sum fixed by the trial judge.
