The applicant has asked for costs. Although costs are not usually awarded in judicial review proceedings, I believe this is a special case. It is evident that the applicant has been made an innocent party to many adjudications until the issue reached this court. Furthermore, the issue brought before me is not limited to the individual interests of the applicant, but as the respondents admitted, it involves matters upon which either through these proceedings or by way of further proceedings on appeal, the court is to make a judicial determination relating to a question which might be raised again in other cases.
