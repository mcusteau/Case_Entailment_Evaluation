On September 25, 1991, Col. S.H. Forster, Director of Personnel Legal Services for the Chief of the Defence Staff at the Department of National Defence, wrote to the Chairman of the Commission giving his understanding of how the
Pension Act
and related legislation would apply to a case such as the applicant's. By letter dated January 23, 1992, the Commission wrote to Col. Forster and informed him that the "Insurance Principle" under the
Pension Act
does not exclude serving members from being protected if they are on Leave from a Special Duty Area.
