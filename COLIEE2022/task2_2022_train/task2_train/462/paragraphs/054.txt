I find that the wording of the enactment is ambiguous and in order to interpret it and to discover the intentions of Parliament, regard must be had to the normal rules of interpretation as found in E.A. Driedger's seminal work
Construction of Statutes
at p. 33 et seq. The learned author sets out the various criteria to be examined, namely the reasonableness of the interpretation, the internal harmony with the rest of the enactment, and the object and scheme of the
Act
. There are other rules as well, namely that acts related to an enactment may be referred to in order to shed light on its meaning. In this respect, the author cites at p. 149 the case of
Attorney General v. Augustus (Prince) of Hanover
, [1957] A.C. 436.
