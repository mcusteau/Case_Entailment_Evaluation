  In my view, s. 225.2 must read in context with s. 225.1 of the Act, which imposes restrictions on the collection avenues open to the Minister for the recovery of unpaid assessments. Sections. 225.1 and 225.2 are relatively new, having been enacted by S.C. 1985, c. 45, effective on Royal Assent on October 29, 1985.
