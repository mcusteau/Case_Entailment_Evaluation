  Nothing in the record indicates that Mr. Montesano followed this procedure or filed any of the required information or was excused from doing so. Rule 7 of the Appeal Board provides that a decision as to granting leave shall be disposed of ex parte unless the Chairman or Vice-Chairman otherwise directs. This does not mean that the decision does not need to be recorded in some way. Further, as stated above, the Board should have provided reasons.
