  By a letter to Mr. Montesano dated August 14, 2008, the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development Canada stated that it had denied his application for a disability pension. Mr. Montesano requested a re-consideration. That was done. By a letter dated April 3, 2009, the Minister again denied the application. This decision was appealed by Mr. Montesano to the Office of the Commissioner of Review Tribunals. On June 14, 2010, that appeal was dismissed.
