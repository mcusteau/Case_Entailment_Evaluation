  The Appeal Board Rules do not provide for an appeal in respect of a decision to grant leave to appeal; however Justice Blanchard of this Court, in  
 Canada (Attorney General) v Landry 
 , 2008 FC 810, at paragraphs 20 and 21, determined that such a decision may be judicially reviewed in this Court.
