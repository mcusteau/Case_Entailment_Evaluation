where the Department of Employment and Immigra­tion, when submitting a recommendation and request for an Order-in-Council, has not made a conclusive determination that an applicant has met the requirements of the
Immigration Act
for landing or permanent residency and later determines that the rec­ommendation was based upon misrepresen­tations by the applicant, or that facts relied upon by the Department were not accurate, the issuance of an Order-in-Council does not confer the right to be landed or to be a permanent resident.
