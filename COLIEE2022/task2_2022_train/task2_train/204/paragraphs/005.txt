  In May of 1996 he moved to the house of a friend in the town of Toluca, outside the district of the federal judicial police, where he stayed until August of that year. During this time, the applicant testified, on approximately five occasions he saw outside the house cars with tinted glass windows of the kind often used by the police. Fearing that he was still being sought by the police, he returned to Mexico City, where he was stopped by federal judicial police, who took his money and told him that they would kill him if they saw him again. He filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission against the federal judicial police about this incident, and shortly thereafter left for Canada.
