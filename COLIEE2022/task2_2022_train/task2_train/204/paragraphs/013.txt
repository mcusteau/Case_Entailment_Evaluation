  Accordingly, this application for judicial review raises the following two issues: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the Refugee Division base its decision on an erroneous finding of fact when it found that there was no serious possibility that the applicant would be persecuted anywhere in Mexico, and was the finding of fact made without regard for the material before it, in so far as the reasons for decision make no mention of evidence that the applicant had seen police cars outside the house in Toluca where he was staying? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Refugee Division base its decision on an erroneous finding of fact when it found that it would not be unreasonable to expect the applicant to relocate in Mexico, outside Mexico City, and was this finding of fact made without regard to the material before it, in so far as the Refugee Division failed to mention in its reasons evidence of the adverse psychological impact on the applicant of being returned to Mexico?
