 [9] 
  The issues in this case are as follows: 
 
 
 
 1) Did the Board err in failing to assess the psychological evidence, medical evidence, Gender Guidelines and the applicant's psychological risk if returned to Mexico; and 
 
 
 
 2) Did the Board err in finding that state protection was available to the applicant within the Federal District of Mexico City.
