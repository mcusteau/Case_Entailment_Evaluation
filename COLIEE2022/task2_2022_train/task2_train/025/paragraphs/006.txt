  On August 24, 2007, the Board concluded that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. In reaching its decision, the Board made no adverse findings with respect to the applicant's credibility. Rather, the Board based its decision on the adequacy of state protection in Mexico, concluding that at least within the Federal District of Mexico City, the applicant would receive adequate, if not perfect, state protection.
