  After reviewing the evidence before it, the Board concluded at page 5: 
 
 
 
 Counsel submitted that the claimant's young age and the political and powerful position of the agent of persecution should be considered. I agree. ...Further, when found and physically attacked in front of her mother in Mexico City, the claimant did not contact the authorities. 
 
 
 
 As a result, I find it is speculation on the part of the claimant as to how the authorities in Mexico City might react, even considering the position of the person she fears. 
 
 
 
 Since the claimant has lived on her own in Mexico in the past, I am satisfied that moving back to the capital where she has lived in the past and where her mother lives today would not be unreasonable. 
 
 
 
 The documentary evidence supports that for persons such as this claimant, the state will provide adequate but not perfect protection in Mexico City. 
 
 
 
 As a result, the claimant has failed to establish she will be at serious risk of persecution or a serious possibility of risk to life, or of cruel and unusual punishment or treatment, or a danger of torture, if she were to return to Mexico City today. 
 
 
 
 It is this decision that the applicant seeks to have judicially reviewed.
