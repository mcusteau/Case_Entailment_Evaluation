  As Justice Tremblay-Lamer held in  
 Chaves 
 , above, at paragraph 15: 
 
 
 
 Â¶ 15 ... where agents of the state are themselves the source of the persecution in question, and where the applicant's credibility is not undermined, the applicant can successfully rebut the presumption of state protection without exhausting every conceivable recourse in the country. ... 
 
 
 
 As discussed, the Board did not question the credibility of the applicant for the purpose of deciding this refugee claim. The Board recognized the issue, but did not reasonably address whether the young applicant could obtain state protection when the agent of persecution was a powerful, high ranking, high profile politician. This issue was dismissed because the applicant did not report the last assault to the police in Mexico City. This basis for the decision is not reasonable because the Board misunderstood that the assault took place in Mexico City.
