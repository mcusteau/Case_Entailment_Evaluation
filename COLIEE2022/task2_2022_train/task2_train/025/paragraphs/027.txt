  In the case at bar, the applicant argued that the stature and influence of her persecutor would prevent her from receiving adequate and effective protection. In response, the Board held at page 5 of its decision: 
 
 
 
 Counsel submitted that the claimant's young age and the political and powerful position of the agent of persecution should be considered. I agree. I would note the claimant moved from her parents' home in 2001 and lived on her own in Hidalgo until she moved back to her parents' home in April or May 2005. Further, when found and physically attacked in front of her mother in Mexico City, the claimant did not contact the authorities. 
 
 
 
 As a result, I find it is speculation on the part of the claimant as to how the authorities in Mexico City might react, even considering the position of the person she fears.
