  The applicant first met this individual in November 2001 while he was campaigning at a low income housing project where the applicant lived with her mother. The applicant was 16 years old at the time. She states that the two developed a relationship and that she was provided with clothes, gifts, and was taken to a number of official functions, where she was introduced and perceived as an assistant. The applicant states that their relationship developed to the point where, in June 2003, she moved in with this individual. However, unbeknownst to the applicant, this man, who I will refer to as the applicant's partner for the purposes of this application, was already married to another woman.
