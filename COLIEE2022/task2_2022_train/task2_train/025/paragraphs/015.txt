  Evidence relating to the psychological and physical harm suffered by a refugee claimant prior to coming to Canada goes to the credibility of an applicant's testimony and whether or not that individual possesses a subjective fear of persecution. Such evidence is not relevant to a determination of whether the Federal District of Mexico City will provide the applicant with adequate protection. A finding of adequate state protection is premised on an objective assessment that must be made independently of whether the applicant possesses a subjective fear of persecution.
