  In  
 Martinez 
 , Mr. Justice Nöel referenced the 2005 decision of Madam Justice Layden-Stevenson in J 
 .C.C. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 534, [2005] F.C.J. No. 660 (QL), wherein she stated at paragraph 18 that psychological evidence provides no assistance in relation to the objective issue of state protection: 
 
 
 
 ¶ 18 I can not conclude, on the basis of the evidence that was before it, that the RPD could not reasonably determine that state protection exists in Costa Rica for these applicants. I also find no error regarding the board's treatment of the psychological report. The report concluded that the applicants would be "at a high risk for retraumatization" should they be forced to return to Costa Rica. However, I agree with the respondent that the report does not deal with the applicants' ability to access state protection in Costa Rica. In my view, the report speaks to the applicants' subjective fear, but it does not assist in relation to the objective issue of state protection.
