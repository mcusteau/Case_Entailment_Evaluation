  I agree with the respondent's claims that the Federal Court of Appeal reminded us in  
 Carrillo v Canada (The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FCA 94, [2008] 4 FCR 636 ( 
 Carrillo 
 ) that Mexico is a functioning democracy and that there is a strong presumption of state protection capability. Even if the situation is not perfect, Mexico is a democratic country that can provide, at least in certain circumstances, protection to its citizens.
