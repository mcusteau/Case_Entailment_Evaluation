  The quantity of doses and the volume ranges used to determine the prices per dose can be used by one of the applicant's competitors or one of the applicant's customers to obtain an approximation of the unit price per dose in the contract. Since Public Works agrees that the unit price per dose is exempt from disclosure, it only makes sense that the quantities also be exempt. The confidential evidence before the Court demonstrates that if the quantities of doses and the volume ranges in the contract were made public, these numbers could be used, together with the public information that the total contract value is $50,799,000, to calculate the approximate unit price per dose in the contract. The Confidential Affidavit of Dr. Robert Van Exan at paragraph 50 outlines that the applicant's competitors could determine, within a few cents per dose, the unit price and structure of the applicant's tender if the information were disclosed. This evidence was not contradicted by the respondent or cross-examined and is the only evidence before the Court on whether the disclosure of the quantities and the volume ranges would allow a competitor to determine the unit price per dose contained in the contract. Just as a woman cannot be half pregnant, the financial terms of a contract cannot be half confidential. Public Works submits that the quantities of the dose is not exempt from disclosure. I do not agree because the disclosure of the quantities would, according to the only evidence before the Court, disclose the approximate confidential unit prices in the contract.
