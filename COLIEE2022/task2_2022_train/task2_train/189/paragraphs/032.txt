  After a careful review of the confidential evidence, I am satisfied that the information in question falls within the exemption in paragraph 20(1)(c). The disclosure of the information can reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive position of the applicant in upcoming bids and can reasonably be expected to result in financial loss to the applicant. Obviously, the applicant's competitors will undercut the prices charged by the applicant if at all possible. As indicated by counsel for the applicant, this prejudice is only aggravated by the fact that the applicant will not have similar information about its competitors.
