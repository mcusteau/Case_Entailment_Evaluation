  In my view, the evidence of the applicant, when considered in its entirety, establishes on a balance of probabilities, that the disclosure of the disputed information could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive position of the applicant. In support of this conclusion I make reference to the decision of Simpson, J., in  
 Perez Bramalea Ltd. v. Canada (National Capital Commission) 
 , [1995] F.C.J. No. 63 (T.D.), in which the Court held that there was a reasonable expectation of probable harm if prospective tenants knew the rental rates paid by the National Capital Commission for floors of an office building. In addition, in  
 Canada Post Corporation v. National Capital Commission 
 , supra, I held that there was a reasonable expectation of probable harm if the sponsorship rates paid by a sponsor were disclosed.
