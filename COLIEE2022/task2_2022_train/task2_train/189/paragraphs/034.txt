 [34] 
  As I indicated earlier, whether it is in the public interest that the applicant's competitors know the price paid is a decision for Public Works to make before it calls for future bids. Public Works should make clear to the parties submitting bids whether or not the ultimate contract, in all of its details, will be made public or will be kept confidential. If the contractor is informed in advance that the contract will be completely public, then paragraph 20(1)(c) would not apply.
