  The Federal Court of Appeal recently provided direction as to the application of the last two criteria of the test. In  
 Hi-Rise Group Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Public Works and Government Services) 
  (2004), 318 N.R. 242; 2004 FCA 99, the Court considered an application by a commercial landlord to prevent the disclosure of rent being paid by the Federal Government for one of the landlord's buildings, as well as the option prices at which the building could be acquired. The Court found that the information in question did not constitute "confidential information" as envisioned by the  
 Act 
 . Noël, J.A., relying heavily on the reasoning of Strayer, J. (as he then was), in  
 Société Gamma Inc. v. Canada (Secretary of State) 
  (1994), 79 F.T.R. 42 (T.D.), commented that: 
 
 
 
 "[...] [W]hen a would be contractor sets out to win a government contract through a confidential bidding process, he or she cannot expect that the monetary terms, in the event that the bid succeeds, will remain confidential. (paragraph 37) 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "[...] The public's right to know how government spends public funds as a means of holding government accountable for its expenditures is a fundamental notion of responsible government that is known to all. (paragraph 42)" 
 
 
 
 In addition, Noël, J.A., stated at paragraph 41: 
 
 
 
 "As was pointed out in  
 Société Gamma 
 , there are good reasons for maintaining confidentiality during the bidding process but different considerations arise once the contract is awarded and public funds are committed to it. Absent special circumstances (national security comes to mind) I fail to see how public benefit could be fostered by maintaining the confidentiality of amounts paid or payable by government pursuant to contractual obligations with third parties."
