  There was some confusion during the oral arguments as to whether the sponsorship application had been approved. The applicant took the position that in contravention of the guidelines it had not, while the respondent maintained that approval had been granted. I am satisfied, having heard the parties and having examined the sponsorship application contained in the tribunal record, that the sponsorship application of David Savard (the applicant's husband) was approved on May 1, 2002.
