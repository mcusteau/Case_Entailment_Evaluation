The definition of "Convention refugee" speaks of a fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion. The only Convention reason which would apply in this case is a fear of persecution for reason of membership in a particular social group. Before the Board, the applicant argued that his fear was based upon the characteristics of his particular social group, namely that he is a "male member of the Bojaj family involved in a blood feud". The question then becomes whether this is a group which falls within the definition of Convention refugee.
