The Board reached the conclusion that the Applicant's fear of persecution related to an act of criminality, not to one of the reasons included in the definition of Convention refugee. Having regard to the evidence on the record, that conclusion seems to be reasonable. Upon my review of the record and having heard the submissions of counsel, I am not persuaded that there is any reviewable error which would justify the intervention of the Court.
