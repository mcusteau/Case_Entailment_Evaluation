  The applicant, a senior high school student who intended to pursue university studies in Bogota, Colombia, his country of citizenship, asserted that he was forcibly interviewed at gun point by two persons identifying themselves as members of FARC. His personal information form, which detailed his story, read in part as follows: 
 
 
 
 I kept walking towards my building. The men grabbed me, one by each arm. They tried to take me to the park that is two blocks away but I refused. One of them showed me his gun so I stopped resisting. I knew they might shoot me. It was getting dark. While walking to the park they were talking among themselves about "the boss" using code language. I did not understand much because I was so scared. They kept talking about the boss. 
 
 
 
 At one point in a dark corner of the park, they told me to sit down. No one was around. They told me they were from the FARC and that I had been chosen to work for them because of my education and that I could help them fight against the army. They told that one of the activities that I could help with would be assisting the injured and protecting the base. They said they would tell me the rest once I was working for the FARC. 
 
 
 
 They said that now that I knew what I would be doing with them, they would meet me in one month (March 4) at my house to start working. One of the men pulled his gun out and pointed it at me. They said that now that I knew they were the FARC that I shouldn't call anyone or tell anyone about this. 
 
 
 
 I was very scared. I ran home. I was thinking that I would not be able to do anything because I could call the police and I could not tell my mom because she is so sick. I knew that the police say that unless you are injured you are fine. Besides, the FARC will kill you if you say anything.
