It is my opinion that the Prothonotary considered the appropriate factors in concluding that consolidation was appropriate in this case. It follows that the Prothonotary was not clearly wrong in the sense that her exercise of discretion was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts and therefore, her decision with respect to consolidation should not be disturbed on appeal.
