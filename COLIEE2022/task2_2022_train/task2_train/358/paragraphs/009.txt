Madam Prothonotary Tabib (the "Prothonotary") dismissed Nguyen's motion, not convinced that any of the grounds for striking pleadings set out in Rule 221(1) applied. The Prothonotary rejected Nguyen's argument that it was improper for Vogo to bring a separate action and seek consolidation rather than make a motion to add him as a defendant to action T-630-02. The Prothonotary held that Vogo's statement of claim in action T-1361-03 was not immaterial, redundant, scandalous, frivolous, vexatious, prejudicial, a departure from a previous pleading or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court and therefore refused to strike or stay the proceedings.
