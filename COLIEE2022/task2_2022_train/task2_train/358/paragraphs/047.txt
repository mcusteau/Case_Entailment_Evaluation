[47]
Acme and Nguyen dispute that the prematurity of consolidation before the pleadings closed in action T-1361-03 is a new issue that was not before the Prothonotary. Acme and Nguyen submit they made argument in their original responding motion record that consolidation was premature, so this argument is properly considered by this Court sitting in review of the Prothonotary's decision. Acme and Nguyen further submit that the Prothonotary was clearly wrong in consolidating the actions when a statement of defence in T-1361-03 was not yet filed.
