[69]
Regarding the motion for particulars, the Prothonotary's decision stated as follows:
"As regard the motion for particulars, I find, in the context of the two actions to be consolidated, of the representations made in support of the numerous motions that have been brought in these two actions, and of the discovery of Mr. Nguyen as a representative of the Defendant Acme in file T-630-02, that the Defendant does have sufficient knowledge of the case asserted against him to be able to plead intelligently. It may be that for the purposes of trial, the pleadings would need to be further clarified and narrowed. However, the sole determination which I am required to make at this point is whether the pleadings as they stand are sufficient for the Defendant to plead. I am of the view that they are."
