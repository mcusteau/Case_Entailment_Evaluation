In an effort to reduce the Band's custom into a recognizable form, the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code
(the "
Code
") was drafted. The applicant has included a copy of the final version of the
Code
in his affidavit [see footnote 3]; it is dated July, 1993. In addition to the
Code
, the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Elections Regulations
(the "
Regulations
") were developed, a copy of which is also included in the applicant's affidavit, and it is dated February 8, 1994. [see footnote 4] A third document was also drafted, entitled the
Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Code of Ethics
(the "
Code of Ethics
"), a copy of which is found in the applicant's affidavit and is also dated February 8, 1994. [see footnote 5]
