The second difficulty with the respondents' contention arises from their earlier submission that holding an election pursuant to Band custom is a power conferred on the Band, and thus must be exercised in accordance with s. 2(3) of the
Indian Act
, which requires support of a majority of the Band members. Although I have rejected this argument, for reasons given supra, that does not alter the fact that it is the respondents' position. If the Band is to exercise this "conferred power" by developing a written
Code
encompassing the Band's custom, which the respondent's have submitted would require the support of a majority of the Band's membership, it then follows that if the Band chooses to exercise this "conferred power" by using unwritten customs to conduct an election, this exercise of power would similarly require the support of a majority of the Band's membership. To use the respondents' counsel's own example, if the unwritten custom of the Band was to have the fastest runner as Band Chief, then before the Band exercised its "conferred power" to hold a race to determine who the fastest runner was, the Band would require support of the Band membership to exercise the power in this manner.
