The facts are these: the respondent Hall was nominated as a candidate for the office of Band Chief at a nomination meeting held on February 28, 1994. The applicant was present at that meeting and was also nominated for the candidacy of Band Chief. No person, including the applicant, objected to the respondent Hall's nomination at that time or at any time prior to the March 14, 1994, election. [see footnote 39] It is not disputed that at the time of the respondent Hall's nomination the applicant was fully aware that the respondent Hall did not meet the residency requirement as was set out in the
Code
and
Regulations
. It is also not disputed that the applicant did not challenge the respondent Hall's eligibility for the office of Chief until the election was concluded.
