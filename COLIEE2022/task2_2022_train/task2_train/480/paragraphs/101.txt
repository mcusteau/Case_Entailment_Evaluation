[101]
The third internal relief avenue said by the respondents to have been available to the applicant is to be found in s. 79 of the
Indian Act
, which reads as follows:
"79. The Governor-in-Council may set aside the election of a chief or councillor of a band on the report of the Minister that he is satisfied that
(a) there was corrupt practice in connection with the election;
(b) there was a contravention of this Act that might have affected the result of the election; or
(c) a person nominated to be a candidate in the election was ineligible to be a candidate."
Justice Teitelbaum in
Jock
, supra, was of the view in that case that s. 79 offered an internal avenue of relief, even though the election in dispute was held according to band custom, rather than under the
Indian Act
. With all due respect, I am of the view that s. 79 is not applicable to band council elections that are not governed by the
Indian Act
, which is the case here. In the absence of a ministerial order pursuant to s. 74 of the
Act
, the election provisions of the
Act
are inapplicable to a band council election. Accordingly, in my view this was not an avenue of internal relief available to the applicant.
