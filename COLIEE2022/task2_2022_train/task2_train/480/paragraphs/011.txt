Prior to embarking on an analysis of the issues before the court, the position of two of the respondents, those being Mr. Ironman and Mr. Pratt, must be clarified. The respondents Ironman and Pratt were represented at the hearing by Mr. Lee, whereas the remaining respondents, were represented by Mr. Sheldon, Q.C. The respondents Ironman and Pratt, through their counsel Mr. Lee, indicated at the hearing that they agreed with the applicant with respect to items 1, 2, 3 and 4 of his Amended Originating Notice of Motion, but disagreed with item 6, being the injunction sought to prevent the respondent Hall from running as a candidate, should the determination of this application result in a new election. This was the extent of the respondents Ironman and Pratt's submissions.
