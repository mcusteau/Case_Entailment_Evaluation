The second remedy available to the applicant is contained in s. 15 of the
Code
, which reads as follows:
"15. The Chief, and any Councillor, may be removed from office by 65% of the total eligible voters of the Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate by a vote in a meeting held within the territorial boundaries of the Sioux Valley Dakota Nation and upon such recall a new election for Chief and/or Councillor(s) shall then be held."
I agree with the respondents that the applicant could have achieved his goal of removing the respondent Hall from the office of Band Chief by taking action under s. 15 of the
Code
. Whether or not the applicant would have succeeded is not relevant. The fact remains that this was an avenue by which a Chief could be removed from office.
