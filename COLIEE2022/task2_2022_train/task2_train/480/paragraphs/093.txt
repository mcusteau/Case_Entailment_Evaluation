[93]
The election was in March of 1994, and within a few days of the election the applicant appealed the results to the Election Appeal Board. However, the applicant did not actually file the originating notice of motion with respect to this application until October of 1994. The applicant deposed in his affidavit that following the election, the Band's auditors conducted an audit with respect to certain Band financial matters. He deposed he did not attempt to institute court proceedings with respect to his challenge to the election results until after the audit was completed, as he felt it would be in the best interests of the Band for any questions regarding the results of this audit to be resolved prior to any court challenge.
