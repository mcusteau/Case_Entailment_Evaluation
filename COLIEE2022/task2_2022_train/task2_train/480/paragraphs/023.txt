Prior to March 14, 1994, Band election procedures were governed by the provisions of the
Indian Act
, pursuant to Order-in-Council P.C. 4283, dated October 15, 1952, and the Indian Band Council Election Order of the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, dated December 14, 1989. There is no dispute between the parties that the ministerial order pursuant to s. 74(1) was revoked by an order of the Deputy Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs, dated February 7, 1994. [see footnote 15] Thereafter, the Band's Council was defined by the provisions of part (b) of the definition of "council of a band" found in s. 2 of the
Indian Act
and was, therefore to be chosen according to the custom of the band.
