It is appropriate at this time to deal with the respondent's submissions regarding the restriction of the plebiscite to those Band members who were resident on the Reserve. The respondents submitted that once the Band decided to demonstrate support of the Band membership via a plebiscite, that s. 2(3) of the
Indian Act
required the consent of a majority of the electors of the Band, and that the definition of elector in the
Indian Act
does not contain a residency requirement. Firstly, as was discussed above, s. 2(3) of the
Act
has no relevance to these proceedings. However, the respondents second submission warrants discussion.
