The respondents have conceded that in relation to the declaratory and injunctive relief sought, the limitation provision is not applicable. However, the respondents do not extend this concession to relief in the nature of quo warranto or mandamus. The respondents submitted that the Chief and Band Council made the
decision
not to adhere to the order of the Election Appeal Board to call a new general election, and accordingly there is indeed a decision of a federal board. The applicant's reply to this submission is that the decision was to ignore a decision, the order of the Election Appeal Board, and this is not the sort of decision contemplated by s. 18.1.
