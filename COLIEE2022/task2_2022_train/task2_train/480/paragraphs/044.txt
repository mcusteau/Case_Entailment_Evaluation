However, s. 77(1) has no relevance to these proceedings. The votes in question, in the plebiscites of June and July, 1993, were not elections as contemplated by s. 77 of the
Indian Act
: they were not elections for the office of Chief and/or Councillors. The votes in question were plebiscites held to comply with the Department's policy in relation to the revocation of a s. 74 ministerial order. The said policy incorporated the definition of elector as found in the
Indian Act
, which is set out above. This definition does not contain a residency requirement. It does provide for the disqualification of a potential elector in part (c) of the definition. And, as was discussed above, prior to the decision in
Batchewana
, if the election were for Chief or Councillor, an elector was disqualified if he/she did not reside on the Reserve. However, the plebiscites in question were not such elections. Furthermore, there was no provision in the
Act
that disqualified electors for any reason, with respect to a plebiscite. Therefore, in my view, it follows that if a Band member had met the first two requirements of the definition, that is he/she was registered on the Band List and was 18 years of age or older, then he/she was an eligible elector according to this definition, and accordingly should have had the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites held in pursuance of the Department's policy. However, this was not the case. Nonresident Band members were not considered eligible voters and were not permitted the opportunity to vote in the plebiscites. In spite of this apparent deviation from the Department's policy, on the basis of the plebiscite results, the Department did recommend to the Minister that the s. 74 order be repealed.
