In the words of Justice Strayer, a band's custom must "include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus". I agree with this characterization of a band's custom. However, determining what is generally acceptable to members of the band gives rise to difficulties, as is exemplified by this litigation. Justice Strayer further stated the validity of the constitution in that case was a question of political legitimacy, and was a question the court should not seek to answer in the absence of some "discernible legal criteria".
