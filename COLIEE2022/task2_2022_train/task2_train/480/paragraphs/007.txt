On February 28, 1994, the Band held a nomination meeting, and the applicant and the respondent Hall were nominated for the office of Band Chief. No person objected to the nomination of the respondent Hall for the office of Chief at this nomination meeting and at no time prior to the election. [see footnote 7] On March 14, 1994, elections were held for the positions of Band Chief and for five Band Councillors. The respondent Hall was elected to the office of Band Chief [see footnote 8], a position the applicant had held for the previous eight years. [see footnote 9]
