However, there is an important difficulty in relation to the plebiscite: neither party adduced evidence as to what question was put to the voters in either of these plebiscites. Incredibly, neither party, that is neither the person who was Band Chief at the time of the plebiscites, the applicant Robert Bone, or the people who presently hold the positions of Band Chief and Councillors, the respondents, presented affidavit evidence as to the content of the plebiscite question. Unfortunately, absence of this evidence makes disposition of this matter more difficult.
