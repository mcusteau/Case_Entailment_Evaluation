Justice Strayer in
Bigstone v. Big Eagle
(1992), 52 F.T.R. 109 (F.C.T.D.), was also asked to determine the validity of rules adopted to govern a band's election procedure, which was to be in accordance with the band's custom. His Lordship noted that the
Indian Act
provided "no guidance as to how that custom is to be identified". [
Bigstone
, at p. 117] He stated the following at pp. 117 and 118:
"
Unless otherwise defined in respect of a particular band, 'custom' must I think include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus.
With a newly re-established band whose circumstances are vastly different (e.g. the majority not being resident on the reserve) from those of the band dissolved some 90 years earlier, it is not surprising that innovative measures would have to be taken to establish a contemporary 'custom'. The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band? This is a question which a court should not seek to answer in the absence of some discernable legal criteria which it can apply. While there might be some other basis for judicial supervision if there were clear evidence of fraud or other acts on the part of the defendants which could clearly not be authorized by the
Indian Act
, there is no evidence of any such activities before me." (emphasis added) [
