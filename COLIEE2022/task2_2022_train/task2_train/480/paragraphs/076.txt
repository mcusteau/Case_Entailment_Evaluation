In support of his submissions as to residency on the Reserve, the respondent Hall attached as Exhibit J to his Affidavit business records of the Band which indicate that financial assistance was provided to himself and his wife during the period of January, 1993, to March of 1994. In his view, this was evidence that he was resident on the Reserve, as according to established Band policy, no Band member is eligible for such assistance unless such member is resident on the Reserve. In my view, marginal weight ought to be accorded this evidence. The definition of "residence" for the purpose of receiving financial assistance is not determinative of the issue at hand.
