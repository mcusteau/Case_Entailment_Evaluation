Despite all of the difficulties cited supra, an election was held on March 14, 1994, and as a result the respondents attained their positions as Chief and Band Council. In my view, there are three possible conclusions to be drawn concerning this election:
1. The
Code
is valid, and accordingly the election had a legal basis and the results stand, subject to the ruling of the Elections Appeal Board.
2. The
Code
is invalid, however the election was conducted according to unwritten Band custom and thus had a legal basis and, accordingly, the results thereof should prevail.
3. The
Code
is invalid, and since there is no evidence that the election was conducted according to unwritten Band custom, the election had no legal basis and accordingly the results are null and void.
