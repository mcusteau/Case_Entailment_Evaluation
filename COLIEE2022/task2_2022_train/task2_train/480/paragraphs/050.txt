The draft version contained in Exhibit B has a line at the bottom of each page which reads: "3rd drft-28-06-93mr". This suggests it is the third draft version, and is dated June 28, 1993. That was the date of the first plebiscite. However, also included in Exhibit B are two pages entitled "Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate Custom Election Code Summary", which contain a line at the bottom of each page which reads "25 June 1993 MR". These two pages purport to summarize the election code, and they do include a paragraph setting out the residency requirement. Although this document appears to pre-date the "third draft version" of the
Code
, the version this document claims to summarize apparently did contain the residency requirement. These two documents together constitute Exhibit B of the respondent Hall's affidavit.
