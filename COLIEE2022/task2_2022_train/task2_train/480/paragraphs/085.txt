The respondent has submitted evidence to support the contention that the applicant believed at the time of the nominations, that the respondent Hall did not meet the residency requirement. [see footnote 36] The applicant admitted in cross-examination on affidavit by the respondents' counsel, that at the nomination meeting he believed that the respondent Hall did not qualify to be a candidate because of the residency requirement. When questioned by the respondents' counsel as to why he did not object to the respondent Hall running at that time, he responded it was his opinion that it was the job of the Chief Electoral Officer to tell Mr. Hall that he could not run. respondents' counsel inquired as to whether the applicant approached the Chief Electoral Officer after the nomination meeting to tell her that it was his view Mr. Hall was ineligible. The applicant responded he did not because there was a movement on the reserve by the supporters of Mr. Hall, going around house to house with a petition to evict the applicant and his family from the community. [see footnote 37] The respondents therefore submitted that the applicant acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent.
