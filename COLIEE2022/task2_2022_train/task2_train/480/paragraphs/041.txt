The Department's policy that the Band was seeking to comply with in holding the plebiscites stated that Band electors, as defined in the
Indian Act
, were eligible to vote. The respondents submitted that the definition of elector in the
Act
did not contain a residency requirement. The applicant responded to this submission by contending that the law in question in 1993 did indeed contain a residency requirement. This issue can be resolved simply by recourse to the applicable statute at the material time.
