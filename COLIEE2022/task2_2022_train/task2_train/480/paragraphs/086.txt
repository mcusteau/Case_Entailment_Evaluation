[86]
The applicant's response to this submission is contained in the applicant's counsel's argument at pp. 84 and 85 of the transcripts as follows:
"Mr. Nelko: ... [T]he fact is that acquiescence may come to play with respect to quo warranto. If an individual has, in fact, participated in the process, an argument is advanced that, in fact, by acquiescing to the process, that may, in fact, disentitle you from the relief.
"Of course, we have a backward situation here where we're suggesting that the respondents in fact, have acquiesced in the process and that should estop them from in fact arguing that the process is invalid." [see footnote 38]
I agree with the applicant that the respondents have acquiesced in the process, assuming the applicant is referring to the process by which the respondents were elected to the Band Council. However, this conduct on the part of the respondents is completely irrelevant to the question of whether or not the applicant himself acquiesced in the candidacy of the respondent Hall.
