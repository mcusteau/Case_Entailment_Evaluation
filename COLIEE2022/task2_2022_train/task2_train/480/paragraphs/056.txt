I agree with the respondents' Counsel, as noted, supra, that the custom of the Band does not necessarily have to be written into a Code or Bylaws. The respondents' Counsel takes the position that the March 14, 1994, election was not to have been conducted in accordance with the
Indian Act
, because the s. 74 order was repealed, and that it was not to have been conducted in accordance with the
Code
, as this
Code
does not reflect the Band's custom. Accordingly, the respondents' counsel submitted that at the time of the March 14, 1994, election, there was no legally adopted constitution governing Band Council elections. [see footnote 27] However, the respondents' continue to maintain that they are a legally constituted Band council on the basis that they were "
elected properly by a majority of the voters in accordance with some of the customs albeit unwritten
" (emphasis added). [see footnote 28] The respondents' had to make this assertion; otherwise, there is no legal basis for the respondents' holding office as Band Council. However, if the court accepts this assertion of the respondents, and then takes it one step further, the result is in fact detrimental to the respondents.
