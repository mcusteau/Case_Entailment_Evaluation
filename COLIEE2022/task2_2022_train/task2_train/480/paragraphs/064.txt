There remains the first option which, in my view, is the most desirable. However, the evidence summarized above amounts to no more than a weak inference that the
Code
received the support of the Band membership. I think the answer is to be found in the conduct of the Band in relation to the March 14, 1994, election and the events that followed. The Band conducted the nomination proceedings, the election and the subsequent election appeal, all in accordance with the
Code
. According to the Affidavit of the respondent Hall, there were 478 votes cast for the election of the Band Chief. Although neither party led evidence as to the total number of eligible voters at the time of the election, the respondent Hall deposed that at the time of the plebiscites there were 964 Band members of voting age, including nonresidents. Thus, it can be said that approximately 50% of the eligible voters participated in the March 14, 1994, election. There is no evidence that at any time before or during the election any Band member objected to the manner in which the election by Band custom was proceeding. In my view, the conduct of the Band in acquiescing in the use of the
Code
, is sufficient evidence to satisfy the requirement of Justice Strayer, as set out in
Bigstone
, supra, that it was "generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus", and therefore reflects the Band's custom.
