[78]
Without having to decide whether or not a person may have more than one residence, I am of the view that the respondent Hall did not reside on the Reserve as of March 14, 1993. The fact that he did commence residing on the Reserve at any time subsequent to March 14, 1993, is of no avail to him, as the Code clearly requires a candidate for the office of Chief or Councillor to have resided on the Reserve for a minimum of 12 months prior to the election date. Accordingly, the respondent Hall was not eligible to run as a candidate for Chief in the March 14, 1994, election and accordingly, is not entitled to hold office as Chief.
