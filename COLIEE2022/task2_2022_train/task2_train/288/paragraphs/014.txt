The applicant submits that it was wrong to say his testimony was unreliable because it was more detailed than the PIF. In my view the Board determined that the applicant omitted to disclose in his PIF material porÂ­tions of events related to the determination of whether the applicant was persecuted. It was open to the Board to determine that these additions were added in his testimony to enhance the fear of persecution. It is no answer to say that the Board told him it was only interested in greater detail and not to repeat the contents of the PIF.
