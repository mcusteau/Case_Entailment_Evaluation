Since the finding with respect to the non-receipt of the summons was central to the Board's findings, this matter must be reconsidered by a differently constituted Board. In light of its findings on credibility, I cannot agree that it was open to the Board to say that if the evidence related to the summons was credible, then it was not reliable. The Board could not properly weigh this evidence because of its speculaÂ­tion with respect to the effect of the word "Bankers".
