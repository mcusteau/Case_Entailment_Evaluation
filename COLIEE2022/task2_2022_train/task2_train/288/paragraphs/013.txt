The applicant raised the issue that the credibility findings by the Board were not supported by the record. The applicant sub­mitted that the word "bankers" on a letter from the CDR, a committee which assisted the government in maintaining its dictatorial power, could not be evidence that the letter was not credibile since there was no evi­dence as to the effect of this word in this type of letter in Ghana. In the letter dated October 4, 1990, the CDR asked him to appear before their Investigation Committee. When he failed to appear the applicant was notified that this act was contrary to the spirit of the revolution and in violation of PNDL Law 78, 1984 and the date set for his trial was November 29, 1990. The applicant was also given the opportunity to respond to the Committee prior to that date. One of the Board members questioned the applicant as to why the word "Bankers" appeared as it did on the letter and the applicant stated he did not know. The Chairman subsequently intervened and the question was not pursued further. The Board appears to have specu­lated on what constitutes proper practices in letters of this kind in Ghana. This error is central to its findings on credibility since the Board determined that the applicant had not received a proper summons. The Board went on to say that if the letter were credible, the Board refused to accept it as reliable.
