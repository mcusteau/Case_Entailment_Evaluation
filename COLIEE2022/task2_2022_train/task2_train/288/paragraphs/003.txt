The Board had the following to say with regards to the changing circumstances in Ghana:
"A number of changes took place in Ghana since the claimant left Ghana. A referen­dum on a Constitution was held on April 28, 1992. The majority of the voters approved the constitution.
"The PNDC government of Ghana granted an amnesty to political prisoners, released confiscated assets, and the new constitution adopted in Ghana ended the ban on party politics. The fact that he was a secretary in a local organization of a small town in Ghana, and after the panel had decided to give no weight to the CDR letter dated November 13, 1990, and on the light of the recent democratic changes, the claim­ant - on the balance of probabilities - would not face persecution for any of the grounds set out in the definition."
