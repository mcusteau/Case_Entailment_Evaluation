Mahanandan
, the Federal Court of Appeal declared that when evidence which can affect the Board's assessment of the claim is presented at a hearing, the Board must indicate the impact it had on the claim. Isaac C.J. wrote:
"Where, as here, documentary evidence of the kind in issue here is received in evidence at a hearing which could conceiv-ably affect the Board's appreciation of an appellant's claim to be a Convention refugee, it seems to us that the Board is required to go beyond a bare acknowledgement of its having been received and to indicate, in its reasons, the impact, if any, that such evidence had upon the applicant's claim. As I have already said, the Board failed to do so in this case. This, in our view was a fatal omission, as a result of which the decision cannot stand." [see footnote 3]
