, Wetston, J., stated that where a claimant is found incredible, the Board must still objectively assess the facts and determine if the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution.
"So, in conclusion, while I agree that the evidence of the applicant may appear incredible, and that it may not appear to be an unreasonable finding on the part of the Board that he was not going to face a fear of persecution if returned to Zaire, as I indicated previously, the Board made too many errors for this Court to ignore by finding that they were not central to the issues in this case. I believe it is the duty of the Board to assess the facts in an objective manner and come to a conclusion as to whether the applicant would face a well founded fear of persecution if he was to return to Zaire."
