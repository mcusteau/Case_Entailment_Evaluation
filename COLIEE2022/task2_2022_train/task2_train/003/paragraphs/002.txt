  The Visa Officer's CAIPS notes disclose that, prior to the misrepresentation being detected, there was no outstanding issue with respect to the Applicant's age or his family relationships. The misrepresentation issue arising thereafter was due to the fact that the Applicant submitted a fraudulent school record. The Applicant subsequently filed a further school record and stated that the misrepresentation was made without his knowledge.
