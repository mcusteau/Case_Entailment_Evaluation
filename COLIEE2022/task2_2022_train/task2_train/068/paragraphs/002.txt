  The relevant facts are as follows. By a decision rendered on September 14, 1987, the applicant's request for a disability pension under the  
 Canada Pension Plan 
  was denied under s. 60(7) of the  
 Act 
 . An attempt to appeal that decision was made in February 1991, four years later, but was turned down on the ground that the appeal was not taken within the twelve month limitation period provided for by s. 81(1) of the  
 Act 
 .
