  The foregoing indicates that the Minister did indeed decide to reconsider his original decision in light of the newly submitted information and that the conclusion reached was that the original decision should nevertheless remain unchanged. When the appeals officer writes in the above passage that "no new facts were made available to warrant a reopening of Mrs. Peplinski's case", he obviously means that the new facts submitted did not, in the end analysis, warrant changing the original decision. It is clear from the above-noted passage that the Minister undertook a review of "all the information on Mrs. Peplinski's file" and reconsidered his original decision on the basis of both "the evidence available now, and at the time of her application in April of 1987". Counsel for the respondent recognizes so much in paragraph 3 of his notes of argument when he states, by reference to a memorandum explaining the basis for the ministerial decision rendered under s. 84(2): 
 
 
 
 "The basis for this disposition of her application was stated by Mr. J. Lawford (in his memorandum dated 22 June 1992) to be: 
 
 
 
 'In Ms. Peplinski's case, our medical advisers concluded that the new facts provided did not warrant the 1987 decision to be cancelled or modified; therefore, as the discretion allowed in s. 84(2) could not be applied in this case, no further action can be taken'. 
 
 
 
 "It is clear from this that the medical report was considered to have supplied 'new facts' and it was on this basis that the Minister, i.e., the Department, exercised the jurisdiction conferred by s. 84(2)."
