  Counsel for respondent argued that unless the Minister actually amends or rescinds the original decision on the basis of the new facts, no appealable decision is made and the original decision simply continues to have effect as rendered. Counsel for the applicant argued that a refusal by the Minister to rescind or amend his original decision in the light of the new facts is a decision under s. 84(2), with the result that an appeal lies under s. 82(1).
