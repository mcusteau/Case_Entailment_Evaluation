  I should point out in closing that the distinction now being drawn was not relevant prior to December 31, 1991, because no statutory appeal existed with respect to decisions based on new facts under s. 84(2). The Minister had a discretion under s. 84(2) to decide whether or not to reconsider his original decision and, if he chose to do so, no appeal lied from the ensuing decision whether it was to rescind, amend or allow the original decision to stand. There was therefore no need to distinguish between those cases where the Minister chose to exercise his discretion to review his original decision in light of new facts, and those where he concluded that the new facts were not such as to require that a review of the original decision be undertaken. Now that a statutory appeal has been created, that distinction becomes essential as an appeal lies whenever the Minister chooses to exercise his discretion to reconsider his original decision based on new facts.
