  Counsel for the respondent brought to my attention the decision of  
 Fortin v. Commission de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration (Can.) 
  (1988), 21 F.T.R. 280 (T.D.), where, dealing with a similar statutory scheme under the  
 Unemployment Insurance Act 
 , R.S.S. 1985, c. U-1, my brother Denault, J., held that no appeal could be had from a reconsideration of an original decision unless the original decision was actually modified. The relevant provisions were as follows: 
 
 
 
 "57(1) Notwithstanding s. 102 but subject to subs. (6), the Commission may at any time within thirty-six months after benefit has been paid or would have been payable reconsider any claim made in respect thereof and if the Commission decides that a person has received money by way of benefit thereunder for which he was not qualified or to which he was not entitled or has not received money for which he was qualified and to which he was entitled, the Commission shall calculate the amount that was so received or payable, as the case may be, and notify the claimant of its decision. 
 
 
 
 "57(2) Any decision made by the Commission pursuant to subs. (1) is subject to appeal under s. 94."
