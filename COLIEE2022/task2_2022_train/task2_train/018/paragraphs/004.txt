  The applicant is a citizen of Mexico who, on his arrival in Canada on September 14, 1996, claimed to be a refugee, alleging that he had a well-founded fear of persecution on the grounds of political opinion and membership of a particular social group (a taxi drivers' union). The Refugee Division found that, while he was a taxi driver in Mexico City, the applicant had been the subject of beatings and threats of violence in 1995 and 1996 by the federal judicial police, the force responsible for Mexico City, and by persons unknown who entered his taxi as passengers. His taxi was at one time stolen and vandalized, and he and his wife were robbed on different occasions. The applicant's evidence was that his problems stemmed from his refusal to hand over to corrupt officials a percentage of his daily earnings, and his becoming a member of a taxi drivers' union that was formed to resist demands of this nature.
