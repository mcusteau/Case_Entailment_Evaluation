  It is well established that s. 18.1(4)(d) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
  does not authorize the court to substitute its view of the facts for that of the Board, which has the benefit not only of seeing and hearing the witnesses, but also of the expertise of its members in assessing evidence relating to facts that are within their area of specialized expertise. In addition, and more generally, considerations of the efficient allocation of decision-making resources between administrative agencies and the courts strongly indicate that the role to be played in fact-finding by the court on an application for judicial review should be merely residual. Thus, in order to attract judicial intervention under s. 18.1(4)(d), the applicant must satisfy the court, not only that the Board made a palpably erroneous finding of material fact, but also that the finding was made "without regard to the evidence": see, for example,
