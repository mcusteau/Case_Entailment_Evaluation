  The Board inferred from the fact that the applicant's complaint to the national human rights body about the incident of police brutality in August 1996 was referred to the body for the federal district that the matter was of purely local concern. There was no evidence before the Board to this effect, and an equally plausible explanation may simply be that, since the complaint was against a member of the federal judicial police, it fell within the jurisdiction of the human rights body for the federal district. In other words, the reference by the national body did not necessarily signify the scale of the concern that the complaint raised.
