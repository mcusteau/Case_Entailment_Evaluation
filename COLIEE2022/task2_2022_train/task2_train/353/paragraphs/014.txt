I am not going to grant the requested order for mandamus requiring the respondents to record the Jon-Wedge claims 1-6. There is no reason to expect that the Mining Recorder will refuse to consider again the original applications for recording, now that I have quashed the decision rejecting their recording. I must assume that the Mining Recorder will reconsider them and I cannot direct him how to decide the matter. He does have discretionary powers under s. 43(1) and otherwise. The effect of this decision is that he may not render a further decision without first giving the applicant an opportunity to express its views on the inspection report and on the Mining Recorder's concerns. The decision also means that he cannot without some warning reverse the practice of the office and insist on strict compliance with certain provisions of the
Act
. But in the final analysis the decision whether or not to record must be his.
