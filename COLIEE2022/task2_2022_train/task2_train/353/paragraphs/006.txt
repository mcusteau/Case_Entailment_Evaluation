Considerable evidence was provided by the applicant, and not disputed by the respondents, that it was the common practice both before and after this incident for the Mining Recorder, Whitehorse mining district, to accept and record claims which, while submitted as full claims on Form 1 with the requisite affidavit, were obviously fractional claims, such being obvious from the plans submitted with the claims. There was also evidence that such claims had been accepted for recording even though the posts were placed on some other person's claim. The respondents do not dispute this but contend that the Recorder had a discretion under s. 43(1) to waive the requirements or not and that the court cannot interfere with the exercise of that discretion.
