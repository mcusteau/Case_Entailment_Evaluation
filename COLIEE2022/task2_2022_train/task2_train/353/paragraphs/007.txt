It is first necessary to look at the scheme of the
Act
with respect to overlapping claims. It is agreed by the parties that one is not entitled to stake and claim an area that is already the subject of a recorded claim. Counsel for the respondents attributes this principle to the provisions of s. 12(b) of the
Act
, quoted above, which allows anyone to "prospect and mine for minerals ... reserved to the Crown". Once a claim has been recorded, the right to prospect in the area of the claim is no longer reserved to the Crown. Thus one can only stake and claim "open ground". Section 16 provides for locating and asserting what is commonly called a "full claim" which must be rectangular in shape and not more than 1,500 feet in length and in breadth. This section appears to be designed for staking claims where there is sufficient open ground that one may make a rectangular claim up to 1,500 feet square. The corresponding form for applying for registration of such a claim would be Form 1 (as prescribed by s. 42). On the other hand s. 17 provides for locating "fractional" mineral claims which, it appears, would be areas of open ground less than 1,500 feet square, not of a rectangular shape, lying between other recorded claims. The relevant form for applying for registration would be Form 2 (also prescribed by s. 42).
