I find that reasoning to be equally applicable to the facts now before me. Since it was clearly Revenue Canada's practice to allow shareholders in this position to make the deductions for interest payments as if they had made the payments themselves, there can be no valid reason for prohibiting Mr. Riddell from also doing so. Accordingly, the interest payments made by Sparkle against the loans are deductible by Mr. Riddell in computing his personal income tax return for the years in question.
