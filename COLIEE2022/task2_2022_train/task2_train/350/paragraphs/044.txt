[44]
This court concludes that there are three purposes to the amended definition of "adopted" under the
Regulations
: to prevent adoptions undertaken to circumvent immigration selection requirements; to prevent adoptions undertaken to sponsor the birth family; and to promote family unity by ensuring that adopted children under the age of 19 who are genuinely in need of parental care are allowed to immigrate to Canada. The statutory test embodies the purposes of the legislation by requiring immigration officials to evaluate the genuineness of the relationship between the adoptive parents and the child before concluding that the child can be landed as a member of the family class.
