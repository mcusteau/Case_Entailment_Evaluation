[94]
The applicant has asked that the following questions be certified:
"1. Can the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board decline to address submissions on errors of law made by an appellant in an appeal under s. 77(3) of the
Immigration Act
on the basis that an appeal is a hearing de novo?
"2. Can an adoption be considered for the purpose of immigration under Immigration Regulation 2(1) where there is a dual motivation for the adoption and only one of those motivations is an immigration purpose? Can a visa office refuse an immigration application of an adopted child on the basis that the adoption was entered into for the purpose of immigration if the adoption creates a genuine relationship of parent and child?
"3. Is the relationship of an adopted child to the natural parents legally relevant to the interpretation and application of 'adopted' in Immigration Regulation 2(1)?
"4. Can evidence that a fully-formed parent/child relationship would commence after the arrival of the child in Canada legally ever be adverse to the child and the adopted parents in a determination of whether the child is 'adopted' within Immigration Regulation 2(1).
"5. Is the principle in
Baker
, that interpretations of a statute which reflect the values of customary international law and treaty law binding on Canada are to be preferred, inapplicable to non-discretionary decisions or to the sponsorship of foreign resident children?"
The court declines to certify all of these questions. In this court's opinion the first, second and fourth questions posed by the applicant's counsel do not merit certification and this court agrees with the respondent on that. The respondent would not have seen any of these questions certified, but with reluctance the court will certify the third and fifth questions.
Application dismissed.
