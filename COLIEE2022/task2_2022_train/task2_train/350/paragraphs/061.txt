The applicant appears to equate the desire to adopt a child with the establishment of a genuine relationship. The statutory test requires more than good intentions. Moreover, the definition of "adopted" is not to be interpreted as is the definition of a marriage of convenience. A plain reading of the marriage-of-convenience clause requires that two elements be present: the marriage must be entered into primarily to gain admission to Canada, and the marriage must be entered into without the intention of residing permanently with the other spouse. As discussed by Sharlow, J., in
Jeerh
, supra, at page 316, a plain reading of the definition of "adopted" shows that when any of the three conditions is found to be lacking, the application must be rejected:
"[4] Thus, Gurnek is the son of the applicant for purposes of the
Regulations
only if three conditions are met.
"[5] The first condition is met if Gurnek was adopted by the applicant
in accordance with the laws
of India. The tribunal did not comment on this condition and I take it to be undisputed that this condition was met.
"[6] The second condition is met if the adoption created a
genuine relationship of parent and child
between the applicant and Gurnek. The tribunal found that this condition was not met. The reasons for that conclusion are discussed below.
"[7] The third condition is met if Gurnek was
not adopted for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada
for himself or any of his relatives ..." (Emphasis added)
