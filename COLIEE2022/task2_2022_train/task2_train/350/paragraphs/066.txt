The Board stated at page 4 of the decision:
"4. The adoptee's relationship with natural parents is irrelevant
"That the adopted child continues to have a relationship with the natural parents should not preclude the finding of a genuine relationship of parent and child with the adoptive parents, argues appellant's counsel.
I agree with this proposition, but qualify that by stating it is the nature of the continued relationship with the natural parents that may be significant in the determination of the bona fides of the adoption. I am of the opinion that the child's relationship with the natural parents is but one factor to consider.
That an adopted child would continue to love his/her natural parents is not, in my view, a barrier to finding that a genuine relationship of parent and child exists between adoptive parent and child.
However, if the adopted child continues to consider the natural parents as the parental figure and authority, and fails to recognize or has not entered into the new relationship with the adoptive parents, that may be considered adverse to a finding of the existence of a parent and child relationship.
