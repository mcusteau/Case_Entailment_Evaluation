The definition of "adopted" under the
Regulations
excludes a person who is adopted for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada. The applicant submits that for an adoption to violate the requirements of the legislation, the adoption must have been undertaken solely to gain admission to Canada. Where gaining admission to Canada is not the sole purpose of the adoption, the
Regulations
do not bar the entry of the adopted child. At page 10, para. 28 of the applicant's reply, it is asserted:
"28. ... For adoption, the legislator has provide [sic] a specific guide or focus to allow the conclusion of immigration purpose. The guide or focus is genuine parent child relationship.
"29. The primary or umbrella test under the regulations is immigration purpose. Given that immigration purpose must be inferred by looking at other facts and is unlikely to [sic] stated by the parties up front, the regulation tells those administering the
Act
what other facts to look at, the genuineness of the parent child relationship. However, where the primary or umbrella test of purpose is met, there is no further inquiry to be made. Genuineness, for the purpose of the regulation, is presumed, once the applicant has satisfied the visa officer or the appellant has satisfied the Board that the adoption was not for an immigration purpose."
The final propositions stated above on the applicant's behalf are profoundly erroneous. Genuineness is not to be presumed and certainly not by showing that the "adoption" is not for an immigration purpose - it never must be so.
