The applicant's submission that the legislation seeks only to prevent abuse is misleading. The legislation does in effect seek to prevent abuse, but it also seeks to promote family unification where a genuine relationship exists between the parent and the child. The applicant's submission that the legislation aims to prevent adopted children from becoming burdens on the welfare system is imprecise. The legislation is not specifically directed at relieving pressures on the social welfare system, although preventing abuse of the immigration system may, in fact, cause that result by preventing unskilled workers from entering Canada. However, the legislation attempts to prevent that outcome by discouraging if not preventing, adoptions of convenience. It is not for the Board to look beyond the statutory test. Doing so would require immigration officials to evaluate whether a child's admission into Canada would result in pressures on social services notwithstanding the absence of a genuine parent/child relationship.
