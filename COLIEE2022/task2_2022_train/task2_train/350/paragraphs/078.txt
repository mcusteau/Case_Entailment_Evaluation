The Board stated the following at page 3 of the decision:
"Counsel asserts that lack of funds to travel to the homeland of an adoptive child should not provide a barrier to finding that a genuine relationship exists. I agree.
It is not the lack of funds to travel or the geographic separation that may result in such a finding, but rather the lack of activity or involvement in the child's life in a way that is consistent with the adoptive parents in Canada assuming a parental responsibility for the child.
If counsel's assertion were true, there would be no need for consideration of any factor other than whether the adoptive parents traveled to see their adoptive child in his/her homeland.
In this case, the lack of funds to travel to China, or even the geographic separation between adoptive parents and adoptee do not determine the outcome.
In this case, a wide range of factors was considered, as Appeal Division jurisprudence outlines.
"3. The parent and child relationship is prospective, commencing with the child's arrival in Canada
"Counsel submits that the existence of a relationship should not be examined until the child arrives in Canada. This means necessarily that there would be no examination, as the child will not arrive in Canada until found to be a member of the family class, and has been given a visa to enter Canada. This is inconsistent with the dicta of the Federal Court in
Sharma
and
Edrada
, as well as with the intention of Parliament which included a requirement for consideration of the relationship prior to the adoptee being issued a visa in accordance with the
Regulations
." (Emphasis added)
