As with the issue of severing family ties, the separation between the adopted child and the adoptive parent is one of many factors which must be considered. The court is satisfied that the Board evaluated all of the facts to conclude that the relationship was not genuine, as there was little to no contact between the adoptive parents during the life of the child. The cases which were reviewed indicate far more effort by applicants than was evinced here. Moreover, the court notes that nobody inquired about the status of Qi Wen Zhao's application during the three years that it was withdrawn, demonstrating little effort by both sets of parents to move this adoption forward.
