The problems which occur when immigration requirements are circumvented are discussed in Mr. Harrison's affidavit. He notes that the age of adoption in the sponsored dependant category was used to circumvent the immigration selection process by permitting the adoption and sponsorship of persons who could immediately enter the Canadian labour market upon arrival. Therefore, persons who should have been assessed as independent applicants would enter as adopted children, and thereby avoid the more stringent labour market assessment criteria. The result was a movement to Canada of unselected and poorly qualified young workers. At the time, Parliament sought to remedy the problem by imposing a requirement that only children who were adopted before attaining the age of 13 be permitted to immigrate to Canada.
