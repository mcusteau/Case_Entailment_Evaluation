In
Horbas v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1985] 2 F.C. 359 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Strayer held that to refuse an application for spousal sponsorship, an applicant must fail both prongs of the test. The applicant submits that the same principle applies here: to be refused entry, the adoption must be not genuine, and it must be effected solely for immigration purposes. Once the Board held that the applicant wanted to adopt the child, according to the applicant's counsel, it should have ended its inquiry, and the appeal should have been allowed.
