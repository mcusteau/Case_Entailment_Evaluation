, supra, where Sharlow, J., stated at page 317:
"[13] In the circumstances of this case, it was inevitable that there would be a separation between the applicant and Gurnek that was long in distance. It has also become long in duration, in part because of the time required by the sponsorship proceedings and this application. It cannot be surprising that the applicant is not as familiar with Gurnek and his every day life as he would be if they were living together. The tribunal itself drew inferences about Gurnek's scholastic achievements that cannot be justified without evidence of the significance of the marks assigned to him.
"[14] When the evidence of the applicant is reviewed in its totality in light of the circumstances, nothing that he said is logically inconsistent with the conclusion that the relationship between the applicant and Gurnek is a genuine relationship of parent and child. In the absence of any indication as to the tribunal's view of the remainder of the evidence, I cannot conclude that its decision was reasonably open to it.

"[29] After reviewing carefully the decision of the Board in light of Justice Sharlow's decision, I am convinced that the Board in failing to consider the context, the distance and the separation, and particularly the way the applicant made efforts to create and sustain the parent-child relationship, made a reviewable error."
