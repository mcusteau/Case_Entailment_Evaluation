[46]
I adopt the words of counsel for the defendant:
"We do not know what was in that sketch. We do not know whether it contained the adjustment circuit or the hydraulic locks or whether it was something completely different. ... It could very well have been something different ... Mr. Bronder (Exhibit P-25) came up with four different ways of designing a hydraulic system for use in parallel keeping arrangement. ... We do not know whether Mr. Rönne came up with the alleged invention when he first made that sketch. ... All he asked Mr. Rönne was 'did you make that sketch', and the answer was 'yes, I made a sketch'. My friend did not ask Mr. Rönne what was in that sketch."
