In these reasons, despite their length, I have endeavoured to cover what I consider the salient features. In the final analysis, I am satisfied on the evidence that the defendant has met the onus placed upon it due to the presumption in favour of a duly registered patent. Much of the evidence I have not referred to primarily because all necessary points had been made. I did not refer to the evidence of Mr. William Ferguson, a mine superintendent who gave evidence on the various machines competing for selection for work at Denison. He tested the machines, or more properly graded them, for a
production capability
. He pointed out that others concerned themselves with different criteria and mentioned cost per foot drilled, dealer service, boom coverage, availability, maintenance planning and operator preference. This served of course to point out that there were many considerations and not just parallel holding and feed rollover. Although he did concede that a machine with these features was selected, he didn't feel they were important in the mining and production areas, and the maintenance people preferred base rotation. Others saw feed rollover as a negative feature because maintenance did not like it. His evidence really downgrated significantly the advantage of parallel holding and in Denison "the drillers drill manually, hands-on drilling, and drillers have not deviated from these customary drilling patterns." He conceded a need for automatic parallelism "but the longer we drilled with the boom ... you could not rely on accuracy any longer". With respect to rotation somewhere in the boom, he indicated, "It is useful".
