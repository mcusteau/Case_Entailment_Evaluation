Mr. Fernstr√∂m maintained (at page 58 of the evidence):
"Prior to 1966, there was
no drilling rig available on the market
in which the boom was mounted for vertical and horizontal pivoting, and the drill support was mounted on the free end of the boom for vertical and horizontal pivoting in which there was provision for automatic hydraulic parallel holding of the drill support either in the vertical or horizontal plane.
"The drill had to be aligned and set in position parallel to the last hole drilled by special time consuming positioning and aligning techniques by the operating crew each time the drill was moved. These were very difficult to accomplish for holes in the upper part of the tunnel, especially so in large tunnels."
