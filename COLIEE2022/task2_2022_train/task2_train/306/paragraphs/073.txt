I must say I was most impressed by the evidence of Dr. Lundquist the expert witness called by the defendant. His evidence at pages 1046-47 after much discussion about various earlier patents, runs like this:
"Q.	Dr. Lundquist, I would ask you now to put yourself in the position of a designer of mining equipment and the hydraulic circuits for such equipment in let us say 1963 as a date earlier than my friend has alleged in his invention date.
"Further, I would ask you to assume that you wish to use as a throttle valve a valve that you knew was likely to leak. I would then ask what expedient you would have, as a designer of mining equipment of ordinary skill used, to deal with that problem in designing a parallelism and adjustment circuit as that shown in the Kimber patent.
A.	I believe that an engineer of ordinary skill of that time would have known then, as I certainly know myself now, that you can use crosspiloted check valves to protect that circuit from leaking through the throttle valve.
Q.	And when you say "use crosspiloted check valves", how in fact would those valves have been used?
A.	They would have been connected as are valves 35 and 36 in Figure 1 of the Kimber patent; that is, across those lines which lead to the throttle valve that is used for the adjustment, throttle valve T25."
