On page 521 of the evidence Mr. Kimber makes this statement:
"A. (Interpreter): My boss came down and I presented my idea to him and he was very positive--he leaned very positively to my idea.
"After that, he returned with his chief, Olle Lindgren. He was just as equally or positively inclined toward my idea and he said, 'This boom we shall have' in particular since
I had solved the parallel holding system
."
