Assuming for the sake of argument that the hydraulic locks are the basis of the invention, the patent is on a very fragile base. On crossexamination, Mr. Fernstr√∂m was asked about 36, 35, 43, 44 hydraulic locks (he preferred the terms hydraulus and hydraulic lock) and he replied at page 255:
"as long as it is understood being two double ...
two pilot operated check valves
."

He also said the same thing on examination for discovery. This is brought out on cross-examination at page 256 of the transcript:
"Q.	... The next question is: What is a hydraulic lock? And you told me on discovery that a hydraulic lock is another name for a pilot operated check valve. Do you remember making that statement?
A.	For two pilot operated check valves.
Q.	Two hydraulic pilot operated check valves together; is that right?
A.	Yes."
