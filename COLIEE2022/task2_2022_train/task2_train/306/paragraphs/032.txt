The Zax patent Exhibit # P-22:
"It works on the scissor principle so that you have a boom when it is collapsed ... then you lift the boom by a type of scissors arrangement. So you have a mechanical parallel holding.
"Q.	Would you summarize what you understand it to teach.
A.	Nothing really when it comes to one patent.
Q.	In your opinion, what does it teach the art, if anything?
A.	Only mechanical parallel holding with scissors principle and the base rotation."
