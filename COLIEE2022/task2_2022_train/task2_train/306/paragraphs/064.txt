[64]
When Mr. Kimber presented his sketch to Mr. Rönne and we find at page 519 Mr. Kimber saying: "he made a sketch and he showed me a (prior) hydraulic system" (the word prior was probably a difficulty in translation so I'm omitting that word).
Later in cross-examination:
"Q.	Did it take Mr. Rönne any time to prepare the sketch?
A.	(Interpreter) Not substantially, not necessarily.
Q.	Was that all done within one day?
A.	(Interpeter) Theoretical system yes but we would return when mechanical system was made precise."
