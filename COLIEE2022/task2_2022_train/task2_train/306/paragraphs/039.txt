This is probably the appropriate time to deal with the issue of the invention date for the parallel keeping patent. The plaintiff seeks to bring the date of invention earlier than the date which appears on the face of the patent. The plaintiff has the burden of proving the earlier date. As Fox's 4th edition reads:
"The prima facie validity of the patent does not go beyond the application date, and if a patentee seeks to go beyond this date, he must prove it by cogent evidence.
