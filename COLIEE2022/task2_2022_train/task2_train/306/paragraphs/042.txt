In the time frame suggested as an earlier date of the invention, Mr. Kimber tells us that as a result of a competition organized by his chief, he came on the idea to have a parallel keeping boom and he prepared this on a sketch. He then made a sketch for Mr. Rönne - "a quick sketch, a simple quick sketch of the placing or positioning of the cylinders". When asked the result of his discussion with Mr. Rönne he said "the result of the discussion was that Mr. Rönne made a quick hydraulic system and he arrived at the conclusion that it could be done, it could be performed" (page 576 of the evidence). This sketch for Mr. Rönne having been made and discussed it was Rönne's suggestion that Kimber should "complete my mechanical design so that the precise geometry was presented and after that he would discuss the precise solution".
