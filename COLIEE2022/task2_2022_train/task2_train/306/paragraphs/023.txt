Mr. Fernstr√∂m also commented:
"We have the optimal equipment sideways. So, here you move sideways to just get the sides smoother. You move a second time to the next hole and then, when you go off vertically, you really utilize the parallel holding and keep the boom ... when you lift the rear end of the boom cylinder, the feed stays parallel. So, you get a minimum of adjustments when you drill these nine holes [i.e. the boom cut]."
