Dr. Lundquist examined in some detail a series of patents. The Stanley Patent U.S. 2613822 was for a weapon handling unit. It is a device for loading bombs into aircraft where the end for parallelism is obvious. This invention was apparently developed during the second world war. Dr. Lundquist, by using a series of earlier patents (Exhibits D-1, Brock Patent; D-2, Lapsley Patent; D-38, Stanley Patent; D-39, Mendium Patent; D-40, French Patent 1189002) proceeded to show beyond any shadow of doubt that the slave-master system we have here was a well known combination. Evidence had been adduced to show parts 35 and 36 on Figure 1 of the parallel keeping patent were installed in event of leakage from manual controlled valve T25.
