[2]
For the reasons set out below, this judicial review application shall be allowed in part only. The adjudicator did not breach any principles of natural justice or procedural fairness in conducting the proceedings and rendering his decision, and he correctly ruled that paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
precluded him from hearing and deciding the unjust dismissal complaint. However, the adjudicator was in error when he declined jurisdiction in a manner that would exclude the complaint being referred back to him by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in the exercise of its authority pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
.
