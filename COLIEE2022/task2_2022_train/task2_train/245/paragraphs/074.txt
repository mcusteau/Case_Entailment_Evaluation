However, unlike what was stated by the adjudicator in this case, an adjudicator appointed under subsection 242(1) of the
Canada Labour
Code
is not wholly without jurisdiction. His jurisdiction is simply ancillary to that of the Canadian Human Rights Commission and of the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. Consequently, the Canadian Human Rights Commission could, in the exercise of its statutory discretion under either paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
, refer the complaint to the adjudicator if it is satisfied that it could be more appropriately dealt with in the context of a hearing held pursuant to section 242 of the
Canada Labour
Code
. I add that in such an event, the adjudicator appointed under the
Canada Labour
Code
would have the authority to hear and decide the human rights allegations to the extent that they relate to the unjust dismissal which he is appointed to adjudicate. This flows logically from the reasoning in
Boutilier
.
