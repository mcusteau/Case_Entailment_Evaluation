I find support for this view in
Tranchemontagne v. Disability Support Program (Ont.) et al.
, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 513; 347 N.R. 144; 210 O.A.C. 267; 2006 SCC 14. In that case, the issue was whether the Ontario Social Benefits Tribunal was bound to follow provincial human rights legislation. Bastarache, J., answered in the affirmative; he observed at para. 26 that "it was undesirable for a tribunal to limit itself to some of the law while shutting its eyes to the rest of the law."
