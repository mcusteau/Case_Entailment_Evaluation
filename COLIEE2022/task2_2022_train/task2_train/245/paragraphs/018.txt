This could have put an end to the matter. However the adjudicator then went one step further at paragraphs 22, 23 and 24 of his decision, and ruled that he had no jurisdiction to hear complaints for unjust dismissal raising human rights violations:
"22. In coming to this conclusion I note that the
Code
has not been amended, as other pieces of legislation across the country have, to reflect the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Parry Sound (District) Social Services Administration Board and O.P.S.E.U., Local 324
[2003] 2 S.C.R.157, 2003 SCC 42. This decision concluded amongst other things, that an arbitrator appointed under a collective agreement, had the authority to interpret the pertinent Human Rights legislation. This was because, according to the court, the pertinent Human Rights legislation is incorporated into each collective agreement.
Parry Sound
, supra, has been applied by arbitrators and adjudicators across the country, and has seen the amendment of various pieces of legislation to reflect the state of the law as formulated by the Supreme Court of Canada.
"23. That said, as an adjudicator appointed under the provisions of the
Canada Labour
Code
, I am a creature of statute and therefore cannot go on a 'frolic of my own'. I must apply the statute as drafted.
. . . . .
"24. It is my conclusion that as I am without jurisdiction to hear this matter the complaint, it would be futile to hear evidence on the merits of the complaint."
