Linden, J.A., himself specifically recalled in
Boutilier
, at para. 24, that it was for the Canadian Human Rights Commission to decide whether or not to send a matter to arbitration if, in its statutory discretion, it deems this appropriate:
"This principle does not prevent unions from bargaining for rights beyond the
Human Rights Code
area, for a grievor can go to arbitration as long as no remedy is available at the Human Rights Commission to vindicate these new rights. This result gives primacy in dispute resolution to the human rights administration, as well as other expert administrative schemes, where expertise and consistency is plainly favoured by Parliament, rather than decisions of ad hoc adjudicators.
PSSRA
is different than most labour codes where arbitration is made the exclusive remedy.
It is up to the Human Rights Commission to send matters to arbitration pursuant to section 41 if, in its discretion, it feels it appropriate.
Any other interpretation would render the words in subsection 91(1) meaningless or twisted beyond recognition." (Emphasis added)
