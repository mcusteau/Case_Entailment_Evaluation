The Respondent adds that the adjudicator properly decided to bifurcate the proceedings as he had the authority to determine the procedure to be followed under paragraph 242(2)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
. Further, the Applicant offered no evidence showing that she objected to the sought bifurcation at the time of the hearing. At no time during the hearing or prior to the issuance of the decision did the Applicant raise any issue regarding the fairness of the hearing, the process, or the adjudicator's actions. Moreover, the reasons given by the adjudicator to bifurcate the proceedings were reasonable in the circumstances.
