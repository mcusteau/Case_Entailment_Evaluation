[75]
The adjudicator's interpretation of his jurisdiction in this case was too restrictive. I am of the view that the adjudicator erred when he decided that the reasoning of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Social Services Administration Board (Parry Sound District) v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union, Local 324 et al.
, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 157; 308 N.R. 271; 177 O.A.C. 235; 2003 SCC 42 ("
Parry Sound
") did not extend to an adjudicator appointed under subsection 242(1) of the
Canada Labour
Code
. I see no reason why such an adjudicator would be precluded from considering human rights issues which arise in the context of an unjust dismissal complaint in the event the Canadian Human Rights Commission refers the complaint back to the adjudicator under its authority pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
.
