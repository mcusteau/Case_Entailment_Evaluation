In this type of case, the adjudicator must decide a true question of jurisdiction; he must delineate his jurisdiction from that of the Canadian Human Rights Commission. In making this determination, the adjudicator must not only interpret the relevant provisions of the
Canada Labour
Code
, but also the provisions of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
. The legislative scheme set out in the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
is beyond the scope of the adjudicator's usual expertise. In these circumstances, it is my view that, either under the case law prior to
Dunsmuir
and
Dunsmuir
itself, the standard of review applicable to determinations by adjudicators under paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
is that of correctness.
