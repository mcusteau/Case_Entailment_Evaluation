First, the Applicant submits that the adjudicator violated the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness since the Applicant was not able to adequately hear the proceedings and the adjudicator did little to remedy that problem.

Although she did ask the adjudicator to take appropriate measures, she claims he failed to do so.
