In the light of the clear statements found in the complaint submitted pursuant to the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
, and the absence of any satisfactory argument from the Applicant as to how her
Canada Labour
Code
complaint differs, and taking into account
Byers Transport
and
Boutilier
(discussed in more detail below), I have no hesitation in concluding that the adjudicator reasonably decided that both complaints were essentially similar.
