[86]
THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
the application for judicial review is allowed in part only. The Court sets aside that part of the adjudicator's decision declining jurisdiction in a manner which would preclude the complaint being referred back to him by the Canadian Human Rights Commission in the exercise of its authority pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
. The remainder of the adjudicator's decision is upheld.
Application allowed in part.
