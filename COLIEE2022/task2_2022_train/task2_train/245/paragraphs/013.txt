Faced with this scheduling and process decision, the Respondent then requested that the proceedings be bifurcated. The adjudicator responded as follows that same day by email dated August 19, 2009 1:05 pm (Exhibit 22 of the affidavit of Eric Rowley, at page 275 of the Respondent's record):
"I will hear submissions on your request to bifurcate the hearing, but unless convinced to do so, I would expect the hearing to proceed on the merits."
