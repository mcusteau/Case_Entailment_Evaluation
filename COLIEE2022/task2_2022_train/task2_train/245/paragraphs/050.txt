In the end, after hearing from both parties, the adjudicator decided that it would be preferable for him to first decide the jurisdictional issue prior to proceeding on the merits. Though there is no transcript of the hearing, the affidavit of Eric Rowley at paragraph 63, which is not challenged on this point, reports the adjudicator's position at the hearing as follows:
"I have to bifurcate. ... I will render a decision on the preliminary objection. If I have jurisdiction, then I will be in contact with the parties for additional dates. If I don't have jurisdiction, we would be avoid calling evidence, etc. [Then, turning to the Complainant:] This also protects you. If I find I don't have jurisdiction, you still have the
CHRA
Complaint, and it allows you to present that and doesn't give the Company a chance to 'discover' your case. ... It is in the best interests of both parties to do so and I will not be proceeding ... ."
