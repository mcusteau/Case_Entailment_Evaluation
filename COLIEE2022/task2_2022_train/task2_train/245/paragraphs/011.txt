The adjudicator responded on August 18, 2009 to the various exchanges of the parties concerning his jurisdiction and the continuation of the proceedings before him by rejecting the Respondents' request for an adjournment and thus maintaining the original schedule for the hearing of the complaint (Exhibit 10 of the affidavit of Wanda MacFarlane at page 63 of the Application record):
"Upon reflection, I am of the view that the hearing will continue as scheduled next week and if the employer wishes to pursue their objection to my jurisdiction they can call the necessary evidence to support their contention that there is a connection between the matter before me and the complaint filed before the HRC."
