[77]
As held in
McLeod et al. v. Egan et al.
, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 517; 2 N.R. 443, management's rights must be exercised in accordance with the employee's statutory rights. This principle applies where the concerned employee is subject to a collective labour agreement and with even greater logic where no collective labour agreement exists. Those statutory rights include those set out in section 7 of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
which provides that it is a discriminatory practice to refuse to continue to employ an individual on a prohibited ground of discrimination.
