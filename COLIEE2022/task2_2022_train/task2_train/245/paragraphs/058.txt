The adjudicator's determination was unambiguous: both complaints were essentially the same. He came to this conclusion in the light of the wording of the complaint submitted pursuant to the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
, which reads as follows:
"On July 4 2008 I was terminated, retroactively, by hand delivered letter, having been disabled since May 23rd 2008. I believe that increasing my exposure to applications known to increase my disability until I was no longer able to function, denying me disability insurance, and terminating my employment while I am disabled citing errors made as a result of this known disability constitute discrimination on the basis of disability."
