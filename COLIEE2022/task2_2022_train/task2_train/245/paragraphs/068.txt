That analysis was repeated a few years later in
Boutilier
, supra. The issue in that case was whether an adjudicator appointed under the
Public Service Staff Relations
Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35 was without jurisdiction to decide a dispute related to human rights that arose under a collective agreement in the light of a provision of that
Act
which limited grievances to matters "in respect of which no administrative procedure for redress is provided for in or under an Act of Parliament [...]." Linden, J.A., ruled that the adjudicator did not have jurisdiction on the basis of the reasoning set out in
Byers Transport
, citing with approval the comments of the Trial Division judge in that case, Madame Justice Gillis, reported at
Canada (Attorney General) v. Boutilier
, [1999] 1 F.C. 459; 154 F.T.R. 40; [1998] F.C.J. No. 1635 (T.D.), and which are particularly apposite in the instant case (at para. 33 and 32 of the Trial Division decision reproduced at para. 17 and 18 of the appeal decision in
Boutilier
) (Emphasis added):
"Parliament also chose, by virtue of subsection 91(1) of the
Public Service Staff Relations Act
, to deprive an aggrieved employee of the qualified right to present a grievance in circumstances where another statutory administrative procedure for redress exists. Accordingly, where the substance of a purported grievance involves a complaint of a discriminatory practice in the context of the interpretation of a collective agreement, the provisions of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
apply and govern the procedure to be followed. In such circumstances, the aggrieved employee must therefore file a complaint with the Commission.
The matter may only proceed as a grievance under the provisions of the
Public Service Staff Relations
Act
in the event that the Commission determines, in the exercise of its discretion under paragraphs 41(1)(a) or 44(2)(a) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
, that the grievance procedure ought to be exhausted
.
. . . . .
"Paragraphs 41(1)(a) and 44(2)(a) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
constitute important discretionary powers in the arsenal of the Commission, as it performs its role in the handling of a complaint, and permit it, in an appropriate case, to require the complainant to exhaust grievance procedures. Paragraphs 41(1)(a) and 44(2)(a) also indicate that Parliament expressly considered that situations would arise in which a conflict or an overlap would occur between legislatively mandated grievance procedures, such as that provided for in the
Public Service Staff Relations
Act
, and the legislative powers and procedures in the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
for dealing with complaints of discriminatory practices.
In the event of such a conflict or overlap, Parliament chose to permit the Commission, by virtue of paragraphs 41(1)(a) and 44(2)(a), to determine whether the matter should proceed as a grievance under other legislation such as the
Public Service Staff Relations
Act
, or as a complaint under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
.
Indeed, the ability of the Commission to make such a determination is consistent with its pivotal role in the management and processing of complaints of discriminatory practices."
