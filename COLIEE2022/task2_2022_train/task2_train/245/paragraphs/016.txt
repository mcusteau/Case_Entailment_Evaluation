The adjudicator noted that he needed to address two questions to determine the jurisdictional issue under paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
: a) is the factual situation in the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
complaint essentially the same as in the
Canada Labour
Code
complaint? and b) does the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
process provide for some real redress which would be of personal benefit to the Applicant?
