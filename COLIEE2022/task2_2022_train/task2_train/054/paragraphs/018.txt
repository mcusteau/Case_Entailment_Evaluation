  Accordingly, I find that the Immigration Appeal Division erred in law by incorrectly applying the appropriate test to determine the genuineness of the marriage at issue, and by failing to analyze the relevant criteria to address that test. The matter should therefore be returned to a differently constituted panel for a fresh appeal determination.
