  In his Sponsored Spouse Questionnaire, Mr. Thorn listed five siblings, with none in Canada. When the Visa Officer contacted one of his brothers and that brother's wife separately, they each listed seven siblings. Mr. Thorn responded to this inconsistency by claiming that they were confused. The Visa Officer denied the visa application, in part on his finding that the inconsistency disclosed a contrived plan to bring the family to Canada.
