  The panel was clearly concerned about the dynamics of the Thorn family and the odd circumstance of the sponsoree's half sister living with the sponsor's family while being omitted from the sponsoree's list of siblings. While this is a valid concern, it should have been kept clearly separate from the question of the validity of the marriage between the sponsor and sponsoree. It was open to the appeal panel to find that the sponsoree is inadmissible for misrepresentation pursuant to s. 40 of the 
   
 Act 
  or that the marriage is not genuine, but the distinction between these two avenues of inquiry must be kept clearly separate.
