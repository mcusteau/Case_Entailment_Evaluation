  Ms. Ouk appealed the Visa Officer's decision to the Immigration Appeal Division pursuant to s. 63(1) of the 
   
 Act 
 . At the hearing, the communication link with Mr. Thorn in Cambodia was insufficient to allow him to give testimony by teleconference. Ms. Ouk testified, and provided evidence to show, that the discrepancy between the stated number of Mr. Thorn's siblings was partially explained by a long-term grudge held by Mr. Thorn against his half-sister, Thorn Sary, the product of an affair between his father and another woman, whom he did not consider to be his sister. Thorn Sary had been included by Mr. Thorn's brother and sister-in-law, while his attitude towards her had caused him to leave her off the list of his siblings.
