  The Panel Member did not find the explanations of Ms. Ouk and the evidence credible. She further held that the failure to disclose the existence of Ms. Thorn Sary was a deliberate attempt to withhold evidence from the Visa Officer which might be detrimental to Mr. Thorn Sambo's application for permanent residence. The Panel concluded that the marriage was not bona fide and was entered into primarily for the purpose of gaining status under the  
 IPRA 
 . Accordingly, the appeal was dismissed.
