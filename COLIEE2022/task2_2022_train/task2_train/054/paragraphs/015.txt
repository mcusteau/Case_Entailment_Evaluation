  In this instance, the Panel appeared to be convinced of the occurrence of the wedding and honeymoon, and did not go beyond cursory inquiries into the relationship between the sponsor and sponsoree. The first prong of the

 Khera 
 , supra, were not addressed either during the hearing or in the Panel's decision.
