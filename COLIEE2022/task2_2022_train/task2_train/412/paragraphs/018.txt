Mr. Lozano’s refugee hearing resumed on January 13th, 2005. While Dr. Diaz’ report was in Mr. Lozano’s Board file, it did not appear that the presiding member had actually read it prior to resuming the hearing, although it was drawn to her attention by Mr. Lozano’s counsel at the outset of the second hearing day.
