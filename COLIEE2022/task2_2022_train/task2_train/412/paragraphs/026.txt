The Board’s entire decision turned on the question of credibility. There is no question that credibility findings made by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board are to be accorded considerable deference and are to be assessed against the standard of patent unreasonableness. Nevertheless, in this case I have absolutely no hesitation in concluding that the Board’s finding that Mr. Lozano was not credible was patently unreasonable in light of the medical evidence before the Board.
