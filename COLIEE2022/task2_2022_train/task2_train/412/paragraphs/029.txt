There are additional problems with the Board’s analysis. Later on in the decision, the Board refers to “the two psychological reports”, evidently not appreciating that Dr. Diaz was a psychiatrist. By itself, this might not be particularly troubling, but my concern with respect to the Board’s understanding of the evidence regarding Mr. Lozano’s mental state is heightened by the fact that the presiding member identifies both of the reports before her as being psychological reports as having come from Dr. Pilowsky, suggesting a lack of careful consideration of the two reports on the part of the member.
