Mr. Lozano was in charge of a local electoral office during the Peruvian election of 1989. He alleges that during that campaign, members of the Shining Path broke into his office and stole a number of election related documents. When Mr. Lozano was questioned by the police about the break-in, the police suspected him of being an accomplice of the Shining Path. As a consequence, he was arrested and interrogated by the “DINCOTE”, the Peruvian anti-terrorism directorate. Mr. Lozano says that he was only released from detention as a result of the intervention of a family friend, who was a commandant in the police force.
