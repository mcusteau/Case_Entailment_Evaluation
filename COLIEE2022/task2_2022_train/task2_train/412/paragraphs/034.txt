Hassan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), 174 F.T.R. 288, involved a similar situation to that presented in Mr. Lozanoâ€™s case. In Hassan, Justice Evans stated:

In this case, as I have indicated, the credibility of the applicant's testimony was fundamental to the panel's decision. The panel explained its finding by reference to the contradictions in the applicant's evidence, and to the slow and confused answers that he gave to questions. Indeed, on reading the transcript I can confirm that the applicant's evidence was on occasions quite incoherent.

However, in making its finding the panel did not come to grips in its reasons with the content of the medical report that had been submitted to it. In my opinion this report was both cogent and relevant to the finding of credibility. The deficiencies in the applicant's testimony that led the panel to find that it was not credible are also consistent with the psychiatric and other problems from which the report states that Mr. Hassan suffers, the treatment that he is receiving for them and the results of the tests administered to Mr. Hassan by the psychologist.

I do not wish to be understood to be saying that the panel's finding of non-credibility was unreasonable in light of the medical report. Not at all. What I do say is that the reasons for decision ought to have indicated clearly that, in assessing the applicant's credibility, the panel explicitly addressed the content of that report.
