The evidence of Mr. Lozanoâ€™s treating psychiatrist as to his mental condition on the first day of his refugee hearing was uncontroverted, and was not addressed in any meaningful way by the Board.

The effect of his failure to take his medication was that he would become confused, his thoughts would become disorganized, and he would be unable to concentrate.
