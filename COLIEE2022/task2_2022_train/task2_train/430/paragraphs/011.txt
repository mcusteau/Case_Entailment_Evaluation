I return to the quotation from the reasons of Mr. Justice MacGuigan in
Merck & Co. v.
Apotex Inc.
cited earlier in these reasons and incorporating in part the reasons of the trial judge in the same matter. As in that matter, the issue before me would appear to turn to a significant extent on whether or not the bulk enalapril maleate received by Novopharm from Delmar on the 1st of October, 1990 was "purchased or acquired", within the meaning of s. 56 of the
Patent Act
, on that date or, in any event, prior to the issue of the Patent on the 16th of October 1990.
