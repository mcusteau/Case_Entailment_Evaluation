In
AIC Ltd. v.
Infinity Investment Counsel Ltd. et al.
[see footnote 9], Mr. Justice Rothstein wrote:
"Rule 501(1) [of the new
Rules
] provides that prima facie the new
Rules
should apply to the award of costs in proceedings commenced before the new
Rules
came into force but in which the award of costs takes place after the coming into force of the new
Rules
. Of course, rule 501(1) should be interpreted not to affect rights accrued or accruing when the former
Federal Court Rules
ceased to have effect. However, there were no rights accrued or liabilities incurred with respect to costs of the plaintiff's motion prior to the old
Rules
ceasing to have effect. Such rights or liabilities could not arise until the court dealt with the question of costs, which in this case was after the new
Rules
came into effect. I am satisfied that the new
Rules
apply to the award of costs in this case."
I am satisfied that Mr. Justice Rothstein's reasoning applies to this matter.
