The following facts support M.W.O. McTague's claim: his injury occurred during a scheduled break in the performance of military duties; it was entirely foreseeable that he would leave the base for dinner because there were no eating facilities at the base, and might be hit by a vehicle while crossing a road on his way to or from a restaurant; and the army recognized and supported the applicant's decision to go out for dinner by reimbursing him the cost of his meal.
