In my opinion, the rights at stake here are not of the same order of importance as the right to be recognized as a refugee (
Pushpanathan
, supra), or to be free from discrimination (
Canada (Attorney General) v. Mossop
, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554; 149 N.R. 1). The statutory rights in question in those cases were closely linked to constitutional rights protected by ss. 7 and 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
respectively.
