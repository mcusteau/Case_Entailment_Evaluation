Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 234 N.R. 22 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court recently reminded us that, in assessing the adequacy of a tribunal's reasons, reviewing courts should consider the administrative decision-making context as a whole, and be alert not to set the standard too high for fear of unduly burdening the due administration of the statutory scheme.
