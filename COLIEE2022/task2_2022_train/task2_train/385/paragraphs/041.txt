That an issue falls towards the "interpretation" end of the spectrum is an indicator that correctness review is appropriate because of the precedential value of the decision and the relevance of judicial interpretative skills for reaching the "best" result. Conversely, an issue that has no or little significance beyond the facts of the particular case will tend to be characterized as one of application, and will attract judicial deference because its determination calls for an assessment of those facts, an exercise that is within the tribunal's area of expertise and does not require the expenditure of court resources for determining the "correct" answer.
