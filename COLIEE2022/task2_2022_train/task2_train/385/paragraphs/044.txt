In my opinion, the questions in dispute in this case are at the "application" end of the spectrum. The applicant's complaint in essence is that the Board did not give sufficient weight to the fact that, in the course of a long day at work, M.W.O. McTague was compelled to go out for dinner by the absence of eating facilities on the base, something that the army recognized when it agreed to reimburse him the cost of his dinner. Allocating an appropriate weight to the relevant facts is an exercise of judgment for which the Board is at least as well equipped as a reviewing court. A deferential standard of review is thus indicated by the nature of the issues in dispute in this case.
