The words of the
Pension Act
relevant in this case are that the claimant's injury "arose out of" or was "directly connected with" military service. These are not terms of legal art, and can be applied to the facts of a given case in a way that is consistent with the purposes of the statute by persons without the particular expertise of judges.
