While it is a part of the lawyer's art to identify in a tribunal's decision some "general questions" that have a significance beyond the facts of the particular case, in my opinion a reviewing court should normally resist counsel's appeal to "principle" when the statutory language in question, as in this case, is non-technical in nature and relatively open-textured, and thus invites the tribunal to decide on which side of a hazy line the particular facts fall in any given case.
