  From here, Ms. Pannu made several claims to the immigration authorities: 
 
 
 
 1.  
 H&C Application #1 
 : Ms. Pannu applied for landing on humanitarian and compassionate grounds in 1995. It was denied, and she was instructed to leave Canada by January 13, 1996, when her Minister’s Permit was set to expire. 
 
 
 
 2.  
 Refugee Claim: 
  She then claimed Convention refugee status in August 1996, arguing Mr. Saroya would find and kill her if she returned to India. She also argued she could not rely on police protection in India, as she risked being raped by them because she was a single woman. The IRB’s Convention and Refugee Determination Division (CRDD) rejected her refugee claim, in a decision dated May 6, 1998. The CRDD panel found there was no nexus between Ms. Pannu’s circumstances and either the Convention refugee definition or the Gender Guidelines. It also found her claims about Mr. Saroya’s threats were contrived for the purpose of her refugee claim. 
 
 
 
 3.  
 Post-Refugee Claim Review (PDRCC Review): 
  Ms. Pannu argued Mr. Saroya would kill her if she returned to India, and the police would be helpless to protect her as a single woman. This was rejected in September 1999.
