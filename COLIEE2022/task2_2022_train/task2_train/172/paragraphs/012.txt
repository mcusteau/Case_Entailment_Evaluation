  The officer also referred to a letter submitted by Ms. Pannu’s father, and found it was not supported by the evidence. In the letter Ms. Pannu’s father informed her that Mr. Saroya had been to his house asking when she might return to India. He wrote her life would be in danger if she returned, and also said she and her daughter would not be able to rely on him for shelter or support in India (Certified Tribunal Record, pages 39-40). The officer assigned little weight to that letter, because it did not come from a disinterested party. The officer also concluded this letter was inconsistent with evidence in her H&C application – specifically, that she had lived with her father before coming to Canada in 1988, and was still in contact with her parents in India.
