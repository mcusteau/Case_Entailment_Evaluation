  I agree with the Minister that the Applicant’s argument places form over substance. It is true that the officer did not identify and enumerate the best interests of Gurneet separately from determining the degree of hardship Gurneet would face if she went to India with her mother.

 The “best interests of the child” are determined by considering the benefit to the child of the parent’s non-removal from Canada as well as the hardship the child would suffer from either her parent’s removal from Canada or her own voluntary departure should she wish to accompany her parent abroad. Such benefits and hardship are two sides of the same coin, the coin being the best interests of the child.
