  Regarding her establishment in Canada, Ms. Pannu argues that the officer’s assessment was unreasonable because she did not give adequate credit for the length of Ms. Pannu’s time in Canada, previous employment, ties to the Sikh community and significant ties to Canada as a result of her child being born here. But having carefully reviewed the officer’s reasons, I am of the view that she did take all of these factors into consideration. Her assessment was that Ms. Pannu had established herself to a certain extent in Canada, but not beyond what would normally be expected of a person having resided in the country for eighteen years. She noted that she does not appear to have close family members in Canada as her parents and sibling reside in India, and that she is currently unemployed. Though that is not her fault (she has had no work permit since 1999), and despite the fact that she cannot be blamed for the breakdown of her two marriages, the officer found that severing her community and employment ties in Canada would not have a significant negative impact that would justify an exemption under humanitarian and compassionate considerations. This is a conclusion that she could legitimately draw from the evidence submitted to her, and I am unable to find it was unreasonable to so conclude. In any event, it must be remembered that the degree of establishment is only one of the factors to be taken into consideration to determine if an applicant would suffer undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if returned to his or her country of origin.
