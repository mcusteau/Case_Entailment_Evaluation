  Ms. Pannu argues the officer did not give any weight to her establishment in Canada. She also claims the officer ignored relevant evidence when concluding she would not face risk if returned to India. Specifically, she disputes the officerâ€™s conclusion that she will be able to rely on her parents for support in India. She claims that despite living with them before coming to Canada, and despite maintaining contact with them, her parents will treat her differently now that she is a divorced woman. In that respect, she claims the officer ignored the evidence that was submitted relating to the treatment of divorced women in India.
