  Ms. Pannu has alleged the same risk of return to India at the hands of Mr. Saroya since 1996 when she made her refugee claim which was refused. This allegation was also made in her 2002 H&C and PRRA applications and it was an allegation made before the Board in her second husband’s appeal of the removal order. In that appeal, the Board found that Ms. Pannu’s evidence - specifically, regarding her alleged past abuse - was not credible and not consistent with her own evidence and that of the other witnesses. As the Minister has argued, her allegation of risk has not improved with time and this was demonstrated by the lack of objective corroborative evidence.
