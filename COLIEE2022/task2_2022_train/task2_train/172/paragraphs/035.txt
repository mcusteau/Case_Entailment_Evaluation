  While it is true that the bulk of the officer’s reasons were dedicated to Ms. Pannu’s abuse allegations, this should come as no surprise. Most of Ms. Pannu’s submissions were also dedicated to supporting her claims of abuse. The officer also found that Ms. Pannu’s allegation that her father will not offer any support to her daughter and grand-daughter upon their return to India was not borne out by the facts or the evidence. She noted, in particular, that according to her H&C application, the Applicant resided in her father’s home prior to her arrival in Canada and appears to be in contact with her parents. Again, this was not an unreasonable conclusion to come to.
