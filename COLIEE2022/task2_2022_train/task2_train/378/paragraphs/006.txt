There was a dispute between the parties as to whether the onus was on the applicants or the respondent in Article 1(E) exclusion cases. In
Ramirez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 2 F.C. 306; 135 N.R. 390 (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal states at page 314 [F.C.]:
"There was no issue between the parties as to which party bore the onus. Both agreed that the burden of establishing serious reasons for considering that international offences had been committed rested on the party asserting the existence of such reasons, i.e., the respondent. Aside from avoiding the proving of a negation by a claimant, this also squares with the onus under paragraph 19(1)(j) of the
Act
, according to which it is the Government that must establish that it has reasonable grounds for excluding claimants. For all of these reasons, the Canadian approach requires that the burden of proof be on the Government, as well as being on a basis of less than the balance of probabilities."
I can see no reason why this dicta would not be applicable to exclusions under Article 1(E). Indeed, in this case the respondent proceeded as if had the onus of proving that the exclusion applied. The respondent gave advance notice to the applicants that the issue would be raised and introduced evidence pertaining to the right of the applicants to return to France.
