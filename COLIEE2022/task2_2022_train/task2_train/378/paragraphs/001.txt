Rothstein, J.
: The issue in this judicial review is whether s. E of Article I of the
Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
("
Convention
") is applicable to the applicants. If s. E applies, the
Convention
does not apply to them. Section E provides:
"E. This
Convention
shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country." [see footnote 1]
