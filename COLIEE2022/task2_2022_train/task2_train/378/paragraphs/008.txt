The evidence advanced by the respondent demonstrates that the applicants' carte de resident was valid at the time of the hearing, that the only obligation of a holder of a carte was to "avoid breaking the law" of which there was no evidence, and that if a holder of a carte was outside France for more than 3 years, the holder must re-apply for a carte de resident. At the time of the hearing the applicants had not been out of France for more than 3 consecutive years. Exit/re-entry visas permit travel outside France for up to 1 year and can be renewed. On the basis of this evidence, the panel found that the applicants could return to France.
