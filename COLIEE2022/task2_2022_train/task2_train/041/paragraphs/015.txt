  Applying these principles to the evidence now before me, I am unable to conclude that the colour and shape of Monsanto's 200 mcg misoprostol tablet are distinctive of the product. Misoprostol is a medicine used to protect the gastro-intestinal system of arthritis patients against damages caused by drugs used to treat arthritis. In other words, it is used to prevent gastric and duodenal ulcers. The evidence is clear that, both prior to and at the date of opposition, manufacturers had distributed and sold hundreds of white pharmaceutical tablets, several of which are used in the treatment of conditions which are concurrent or associated with gastric ulcers. Furthermore, there are other six sided tablets on the market that are white, namely Inderide and Silindac. Without the markings "Searle 1461", which are not claimed as part of the trademark in question, it would not be possible to identify and distinguish the respondent Monsanto's white hexagonal misoprostol tablets from any other white, hexagonal tablet on the market. The respondent has not adduced any evidence which clearly establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that a significant number of consumers associate the appearance of its product with a single source. Accordingly, it has failed to establish the distinctiveness required for a valid trademark.
