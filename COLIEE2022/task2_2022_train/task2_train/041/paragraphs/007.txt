 [7] 
  First, paragraph 30(h) of the  
 Trade-Marks Act 
  provides that a trademark application must contain a drawing of the trademark and such number of accurate representations of the mark as may be prescribed. The onus is on the applicant for a mark to show its compliance with this requirement of the legislation. The drawing submitted must be a meaningful representation of the applicant's mark in the context of the written description appearing in the application and must enable the determination of the three-dimension limits of the tablet to which the colour is applied. The rationale behind these statutory requirements is that a trademark registration is a monopoly and must therefore, be precise in terms of its scope. As stated in by this Court in  
 Mennen Canada Inc. v. Gillette Canada Inc. et al. 
  (1991), 50 F.T.R. 197; 40 C.P.R.(3d) 76, at p. 87: 
 
 
 
 "It is the mark so depicted in the drawing, reproducible with a certificate of registration, which then provides the notice to the world of the owner's proprietary interest in the trade mark and which forms the evidentiary basis for actions of infringement or for expungement. Useful as photographs and sample of a trade mark, including a distinguishing guise, may be upon application for registration, to ensure the drawing is a reasonable representation of the trade mark claimed, in my view, those do not form part of the trade mark for registration or for other purposes under the  
 Act 
 ."
