  It is true that the Board will be presumed to have considered all of the evidence before it, but when there is relevant evidence which runs contrary to the Board's findings on the central issue, in this case the genuineness of the marriage, the Board has the duty to analyse that evidence and to explain why it does not accept it or prefers other evidence on that point ( 
 Cepeda-Gutierrez et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1998), 157 F.T.R. 35; 83 A.C.W.S.(3d) 264 (T.D.) at paras. 14-17). The Board should have further explained why such evidence, which corroborates the Applicant's testimony, was not allowed.
