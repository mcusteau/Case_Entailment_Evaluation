Having encouraged such disclosure, to assist applicants, nevertheless I conclude that non disclosure of information about the methods or process for assessing risk in considering applicants for the PDRCC class, in advance of a decision, did not in this case constitute unfairness. I note that this information was not requested on behalf of the applicant when he was notified that he could, or when he did, make submissions. Thus there was no refusal to produce the information. No case is made out, of unfairness to the applicant in the application of the process or methods here applied by the PCDO. For example, no argument is made that the application of guidelines or principles set out in the manual constituted unfairness to the applicant in the circumstances of this case. For the applicant it is submitted that so far as the manual reveals methodology it is not appropriate for objective assessment of risk when compared with academic approaches to risk assessment. In my view, that is not an issue for this court in an application for judicial review. It may be that counsel could persuade the court that the methods adopted have no merit for risk assessment but I am not persuaded that is the case here.
