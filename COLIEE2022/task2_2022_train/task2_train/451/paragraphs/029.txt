The applicant's final concern is that the PCDO ignored or treated in a capricious manner facts concerning the targeting by various death squads of FMLN and former FMLN members and the inability of the El Salvador government to prevent or bring to justice those responsible for death threats, injuries or deaths of former FMLN members, like himself. It is true there were reports before the PCDO which would support a scene of uncontrolled violence inflicted on some former FMLN members; there were other reports which highlighted improvements from that grim picture and which supported the PCDO's conclusions, inter alia, that there was no evidence that authorities target former FMLN sympathizers and scant evidence that FMLN members seek to settle old suspicions in a violent manner, or that they control strategic travel centres as the applicant feared. Moreover, the relatively minor role of the applicant within the FMLN, the lack of evidence, despite his fears, that his name had in fact been reported to authorities, more than six years earlier before he left El Salvador, the lack of any claim that authorities or FMLN sympathizers had tried to do anything to him before he left or had harassed his family since then, by inference, support the PCDO's conclusion that he could return to El Salvador and not be at risk.
