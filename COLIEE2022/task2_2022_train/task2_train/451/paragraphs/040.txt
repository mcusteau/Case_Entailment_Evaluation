[40]
I conclude that the questions proposed by the applicant concerning the methodology of risk assessment, should not be certified under s. 83(1) of the
Act
. The first question proposed by the applicant, is certified in terms similar to those proposed in
Nadarajah
, as follows:
"Does an immigration officer conducting a review pursuant to the PDRCC regulations violate the principle of fairness, as enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Shah
, when he or she fails to disclose, in advance of determining the matter, documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions?"
Order accordingly.
