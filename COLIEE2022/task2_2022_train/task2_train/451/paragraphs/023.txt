I am not persuaded that the duty of fairness extends to disclosure of a methodology for risk assessment that would be accepted by theoreticians or academics concerned with risk assessment theory and practice. Nor am I persuaded that uncertainties and a measure of those as they may be recognized in seeking to assess risks for purposes of the PDRCC class should be disclosed, as counsel for the applicant suggests. Risk assessment is not an exact science, even for actuaries and mathematicians whose vocations may be in professional work of measuring comparative risks. Risk assessment by a PCDO is not of that sort. I am not convinced that it was intended to be more than a reasonable assessment, objectively done in the sense that it is done with reference to the evidence that may be available in all the circumstances, of serious risk to life or liberty of the individual claimant.
