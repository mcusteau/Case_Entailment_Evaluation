In recognition of the importance of judicial comity in respect of decisions of my colleagues, and of the importance of treating similarly persons who are in similar circumstances but in different cases, in my view it is appropriate in this case to certify a question similar in terms to the question proposed in
Nadarajah
and the other cases referred to, concerning failure to disclose in advance of a decision information relied upon from public sources. Determination of that question by the Court of Appeal in any of the other cases will, in effect, dispose of any appeal under s. 83 in this case, subject to any requirement for a formal order of the Court of Appeal to dispose of an appeal if one be initiated.
