The Board found that the applicant's claim that she was found by Mr. Gonzalez in Villa Del Carbon was implausible. The applicant did not know the date which she was found, except that it was in June of 2007. The applicant claimed that she did not work, she did not call her children, and that she hid in the house. The Board noted that Villa Del Carbon was located 1.5 hours away from Mr. Gonzalez's home, that he had no relatives in town and when she was asked about how he could have found her simply walking down the street when he had no reason to be there, the applicant claimed that he may have followed someone to the town and found her and that he has many friends in the police. The Board did not accept this explanation as the applicant had earlier stated that she did not know how he found her and that the applicant had never mentioned in her PIF that he had friends in the police, which was an important fact relating to the availability of state protection, the existence of an IFA and Mr. Gonzalez's ability to act with impunity.
