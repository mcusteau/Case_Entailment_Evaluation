In this case, the applicant has raised a number of issues, all relating to the Board's findings regarding the applicant's credibility and the treatment of the evidence. It is well established that these questions are highly factual and require a high level of deference (see
Ortiz Juarez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2006 FC 288). The Board is a specialized tribunal that is in the best position to make assessments of credibility and to weigh the evidence presented to it. Thus, the standard of review is reasonableness. The Court should not intervene on judicial review unless the Board has come to a conclusion that is not transparent, justifiable and intelligible and within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the evidence before it (see
Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick
, 2008 SCC 9, at paragraph 47,
Khosa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2009 SCC 12 at paragraph 59).
