The respondent submits that the applicant's submission that the Board's decision is unclear is based on a typographical error regarding the years that the applicant was in a relationship with Mr. Gonzalez. It is clear from the reasons as a whole, that the Board accepted that the applicant was in a relationship with Mr. Gonzalez from 1988 to 1998, and the main issue was whether this relationship was resumed from 2002 to 2007. The respondent relies on
Petrova v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
, 2004 FC 506, where the Court held that an overall reading of the decision showed that the mistake was typographical in nature and not a misunderstanding of the material evidence and thus, there was no reviewable issue. The reference to 1988 instead of 1998 in this case was also a typographical error and does not raise a reviewable issue.
