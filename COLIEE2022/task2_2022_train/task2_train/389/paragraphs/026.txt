The applicant notes that the Board asked her to explain how Mr. Gonzalez found her when she moved to Villa Del Carbon. The applicant could not be expected to know how he found her and this line of questioning required the applicant to speculate, which the Board then used against her. The applicant submits that this line of questioning and reasoning was made in a perverse and capricious manner and constituted a reviewable error.
