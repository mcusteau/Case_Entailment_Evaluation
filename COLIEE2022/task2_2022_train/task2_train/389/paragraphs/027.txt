In
R.K.L. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 162, the Court found that failure to mention key evidence in a written statement to the authorities, or the existence of inconsistencies between a written statement and a subsequent testimony can sustain a negative credibility finding. The applicant was accorded significant time to amend her PIF if she wished to ensure its adequacy and completeness, particularly because the hearing had been postponed twice. The applicant did make some amendments before the hearing. The respondent then notes a number of occasions where the transcript indicates that the Board asked the applicant why certain key events were not in her PIF or why the PIF was not amended to include these events. The respondent admits that the transcript indicated that the Board member conceded that the applicant had not failed to mention that part of the motivation for the abuse was because Mr. Gonzalez did not believe he was the father of one of her sons. However, the respondent submits that this minor error does not warrant a remedy on judicial review, as it was not central to the Board's decision.
