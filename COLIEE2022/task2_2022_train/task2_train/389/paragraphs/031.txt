The respondent points to a number of instances in the hearing where the Board questioned the applicant regarding documents that could have supported her claims. The Board's finding that the applicant failed to provide credible evidence was not based solely on the lack of documents to corroborate her claims, but instead was based on a number of concerns with the credibility of the evidence. There was inconsistent evidence provided regarding the nature and timing of the abuse, and thus the Board's observations of the lack of corroborating documents are relevant. In
Juarez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2006 FC 288, the Court said that if there are concerns regarding the reliability of testimony, the decision maker may search for corroborating evidence. The respondent also notes
Muchirahondo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2008 FC 546, where the Court stated that the Board is entitled to conclude that evidence is not credible if the applicant does not corroborate her claims. Based on these cases, the respondent submits that the decision is reasonable overall because the Board's decision does not rely solely on the failure to provide corroborating evidence, but on other credibility concerns as well.
