The Board then found that the applicant did not provide sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence that she had been abused. The Board noted that the applicant had provided a document which indicated that she left the marital home because of verbal aggressions. However, when questioned about the report and why it failed to indicate physical abuse, the applicant claimed it was because the police do not put details of abuse in reports unless there are visible marks or if they are offered money and that Mr. Gonzalez beat her in a manner that did not leave marks. The Board rejected this explanation because it was unreasonable for the police to have recorded verbal aggressions if they were not interested in her allegations of abuse. The Board also noted that the applicant claimed she made three police reports, but none were ever acted upon. The Board found that it was implausible that the applicant would have returned to file two more police reports after the first if she knew that the police were not going to follow up on her allegations.
