The Board found that the allegations regarding physical and sexual assaults were not credible because the applicant stated in her testimony that the abuse was more sexual than physical, but the PIF described physical violence. The mere fact that physical abuse occurred does not preclude the possibility that sexual abuse occurred more often. It was not possible to conclude that the sexual abuse did not occur more often or that the applicant was not telling the truth regarding the abuse on the basis that some physical abuse occurred.
