Similarly, the Board states that when the applicant was questioned about the omission of the allegations of rape from the PIF, the applicant responded that she had indicated that he had "checked all [her] body" and that that was the same as rape. The applicant submits that this is a misstatement of the evidence as she said that he would check her body and that she wrote it wrong. It was perverse to say that the applicant would have stated that checking her body was the same as rape. The applicant submits that these misstatements of the evidence were used to make negative inferences regarding the applicant's credibility and that this brings into question the validity of the Board's whole analysis.
