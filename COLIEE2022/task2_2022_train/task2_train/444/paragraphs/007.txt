The plaintiffs' application is supported by a number of affidavits, some current, others sworn in earlier proceedings in this action. In that the present proceeding to strike out is under rule 401, on a jurisdictional point, and not under rule 419(1), as disclosing no reasonable cause of action, affidavit evidence is permissible: see
Erasmus et al. v. Minister of National Revenue
, [1992] 2 F.C. 681; 145 N.R. 321, at p. 687 (F.C.A.).
