Second, even assuming that the defendants ought to have exhausted an alternative remedy, that is a remedy through an Election Appeal Board, that does not end the matter, for a party need not exhaust all prior remedies where such remedies are inadequate: see for example
Harelkin v. University of Regina
, [1979] 3 W.W.R. 676; 26 N.R. 364, a decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, where Mr. Justice Beetz discussed this aspect at p. 696 et seq. See also the dissenting reasons of Mr. Justice Dickson, as he then was, at p. 714 et seq. The category of factors to be considered, in weighing whether a court should accept jurisdiction or require an applicant to proceed with an adequate statutory remedial procedure, is never closed:
Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band et al.
, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3; 177 N.R. 325, at p. 31. In the present instance it may well be that the destruction of the ballots by one of the plaintiffs, before they were recounted, would have prevented any Election Appeal Board from doing its job and as a result the Board either might have been able to give only an inadequate remedy or might no longer have had any jurisdiction: see for example
Saltfleet (Municipality) Board of Health v. Knapman
, [1954] 3 D.L.R. 760 (H.C.), at p. 774, Mr. Justice Gail's reasons being approved by the Supreme Court of Canada [1956] S.C.R. 877.
