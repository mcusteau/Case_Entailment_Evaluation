Nancy Allison, one of the defendants, was asked on examination for discovery, at Question 222, to confirm that the appeal petition, which had been taken to the Band Office and stamped, had not been left at the Band Office. Her response was:
"I believe there was one there, because I knew it was there, because I was Acting Administrator at the time."
She goes on to set out the date on which she saw the petition at the office and the circumstances surrounding it. See also Questions 268 et seq. of the discovery transcript which appear to establish that there was a copy of the document referred to as the appeal which had been kept in the Band Office when it was stamped on April 27. The subject of the appeal also appears in the April 25 and April 27, 1994, Band meeting minutes.
