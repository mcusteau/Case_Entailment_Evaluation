I note that the parties have recently obtained an expedited trial date, with the trial to commence June 17, 1996. The plaintiffs have been looking at the counterclaim for some 21 months. They leave it late to make an elaborate motion to strike out. In my view the plaintiffs are estopped from moving to strike out in the present instance, but ought to be required to leave the matter to the trial judge who can assess the witnesses. For this reason I would dismiss the motion. However, if I am wrong, there are three other reasons why the motion ought to be denied.
