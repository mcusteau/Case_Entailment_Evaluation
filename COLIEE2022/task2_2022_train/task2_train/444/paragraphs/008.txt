On the plaintiffs' analysis, a failure to exhaust the election appeal remedies under the
Customs Election Regulations
, and leaving aside whether or not a proper or any Election Appeal Board had been established, the plaintiffs must show that no appeal was filed. There is various affidavit material to this effect, including the affidavit of Joan Bent, the Electoral Officer for the election in question and the February 2, 1996, affidavit of Tony Qualtier which sets out that he was asked to sit on the Election Appeal Board, but did not see a copy of the appeal petition. However, there is conflicting evidence for the defendants. For example, the affidavit of Theresa Dennis, sworn July 18, 1994, sets out that:
"7. On April 27, 1994, an appeal of the Election (the 'Appeal') was filed in the LSIB [Lower Similkameen Indian Band] office. It was stamped by Kathy Terbasket. The Appeal was signed by 36 LSIB members. Attached to this my Affidavit and marked Exhibit '2' is a copy of the Appeal."
The so-called appeal appears to have been in the form of a petition.
