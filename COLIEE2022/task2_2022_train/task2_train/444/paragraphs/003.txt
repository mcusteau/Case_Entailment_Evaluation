The plaintiffs, who have produced an elaborate chronology of events, say the defendants did not file an appeal of the election result and thus failed to exercise their remedies under the
Lower Similkameen Indian Band Customs Election Regulations
(the "
Customs Election Regulations
"). The defendants deny this, pleading that they filed an appeal on April 27, 1994, well within the appeal period, all as required by Part VIII of the
Customs Election Regulations
and point out that the issue of the filing of an appeal is at the heart of the whole case. This seems to me an issue on which a judge ought to hear witnesses at trial.
