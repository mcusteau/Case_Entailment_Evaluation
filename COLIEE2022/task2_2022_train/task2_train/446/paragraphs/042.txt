I have concluded that the issues related to Guideline 7 in the 19 applications before me that I must address in these reasons are as follows:
1. What is the standard of review to be applied to the applications under review?
2. Whether an analysis of the Guideline 7 procedure pursuant to the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
analysis is required and, if so, does it infringe fundamental justice under s. 7 or violate s. 15?
3. Was the procedure mandated by Guideline 7, in itself, contrary to common law principles of natural justice?
4. Did the implementation of Guideline 7 fetter the discretion of Board members?
5. Is Guideline 7 beyond the scope of the Chairperson's authority to issue guidelines?
6. Does questioning by the Board member demonstrate a reasonable apprehension of institutional bias?
7. If natural justice is implicated, when must the applicant raise an objection to the use of Guideline 7?
