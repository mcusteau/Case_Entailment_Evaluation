In
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; 281 N.R. 1; 2002 SCC 1 (
Suresh
), the Supreme Court made the following comment in relation to the scope of fundamental justice at paragraph 113:
"The principles of fundamental justice of which s. 7 speaks, though not identical to the duty of fairness elucidated in
Baker
, are the same principles underlying that duty. As Professor Hogg has said, 'The common law rules [of procedural fairness] are in fact basic tenets of the legal system, and they have evolved in response to the same values and objectives as s. 7': see P.W. Hogg,
Constitutional Law of Canada
(Looseleaf Ed.), vol. 2, at para. 44.20. In
Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177, at pp. 212-13, Wilson, J., recognized that the principles of fundamental justice demand, at a minimum, compliance with the common law requirements of procedural fairness. Section 7 protects substantive as well as procedural rights:
Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act
, supra.
Insofar as procedural rights are concerned, the common law doctrine summarized in Baker, supra, properly recognizes the ingredients of fundamental justice
." (Emphasis added)
