While claimants seeking decisions from the Board respecting the procedure to be followed at its hearings should normally follow the requirements set out in RPD Rules 43 and 44, that is by filing a written submission supported by evidence without delay before the hearing, I do not accept the respondent's submission that failure to do so necessarily invokes the waiver doctrine. As I read the jurisprudence, waiver will not be implied where the party against whom it is claimed has made an objection to the procedure before or during the hearing itself. What the doctrine seeks to prevent is the litigant who sits mute through the procedure and tries to take advantage of the issue before a higher forum.
