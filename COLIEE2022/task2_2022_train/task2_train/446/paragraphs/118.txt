To illustrate, the applicants point to the case of applicant Gutierrez Trujillo (IMM-2709-05) in which a psychological report had been submitted to the Board indicating that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress that could affect his ability to testify. The Board Member did not refer to this evidence in making his determination that the Guideline 7 order should be maintained. The applicants submit that fairness cannot be ensured by a case-by-case determination of the order of questioning if such evidence can be readily discounted or overlooked. Moreover, they submit, such a process would not contribute to the efficient use of the Board's resources. The only practical approach to the reality that many claimants have vulnerabilities which would make it fairer for their counsel to question them first, is to require this as the normal procedure.
