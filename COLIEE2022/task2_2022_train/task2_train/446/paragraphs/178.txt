[178]
The term "guideline" does not appear to be defined in the statutes. The definition provided by the
Canadian Oxford Dictionary
, 2001 Edition, is "a principle or criterion, guiding or directing action". "Directives" as employed in the French version, may also be construed as directing action. The definition provided by
Le Petit Robert
, 2002 edition, is "indication, ligne de conduite donnée par une autorité." In
Thamotharem
, Justice Blanchard employed the definition from the
Oxford English Dictionary
: "a line for guiding; a directing or standardizing principle laid down as a guide to procedure, policy, etc."
