The applicants submit that a number of considerations common to refugee claimants underscore the need to allow claimants' counsel to conduct an examination-in-chief in refugee proceedings. The applicants point to characteristics shared by many refugee claimants which result from their experiences prior to coming to Canada. The following is a list of the characteristics identified:
1. Distrust of individuals in general and government agents in particular;
2. Post-traumatic Stress Disorder;
3. Suppression and/or Repression of memories;
4. Anxiety and Panic Attacks; and
5. Depression.
The applicants submit that because of these considerations, it is unfair to the applicants to have questioning begin by someone other than their own counsel.
