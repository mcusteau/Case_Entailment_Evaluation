[129]
A convenient starting point for an analysis of this issue is the decision of the Ontario Court of Appeal in
Ainsley Financial Corp. et al. v. Ontario Securities Commission et al.
(1994), 77 O.A.C. 155; 21 O.R.(3d) 104; 121 D.L.R.(4th) 79 (C.A.) (
Ainsley
). In that case, the issue was whether an Ontario Securities Commission policy statement was actually a set of binding rules and thus required legislative or regulatory authority.
