Contrary to the applicants' assertions that Guideline 7 is intended to be a mandatory provision, the respondent submits that paragraph 23 anticipates that it may not be appropriate in every hearing. The Guideline does not require a specific mode of procedure. The claimant is free in any particular case to bring to the attention of the Board any relevant evidence which would establish why proceeding with an examination by the RPO or Board member would prejudice their case.
