The applicants submit that the characterization of the refugee determination process as non-adversarial is suspect when the role of counsel for the claimant is compared to that of the RPO. Counsel's role is to demonstrate that the claimant is a person in need of protection. By contrast, the role of the RPO is, in part they submit, to flush out any weaknesses in the claimant's case which may lead to a determination that a person is not a person in need of protection. In this sense, the applicants contend the roles of counsel and the RPO are opposed.
