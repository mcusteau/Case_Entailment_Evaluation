I note that in
Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84; 280 N.R. 268; 2002 SCC 3, at para. 19, Justice Iacobucci stated that it was not necessary to consider the scope of s. 7 in a case arising in the immigration context as it could be decided on administrative law principles and statutory interpretation. The same conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court in
Baker
, above, at para. 11. In
Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex et al.
, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559; 287 N.R. 248; 166 B.C.A.C. 1; 271 W.A.C. 1; 2002 SCC 42, the Court discouraged litigants from seeking the use of "
Charter
values" to interpret legislation when it was not absolutely necessary to resolve ambiguity.
