[71]
I am satisfied that there is an insufficient factual basis in this case upon which the Court could decide whether claimants in refugee determination proceedings were discriminated against through the implementation of Guideline 7 as contemplated by s. 15 of the
Charter
. And, as discussed above, it is not necessary to determine the question when there is an adequate alternative remedy available to the applicants at common law. Accordingly, I decline to address that question.
Is the procedure mandated by Guideline 7 and adopted by the tribunal contrary to natural justice?
