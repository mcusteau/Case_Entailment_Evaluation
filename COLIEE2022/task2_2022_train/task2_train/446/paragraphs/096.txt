The respondent points to the legislative framework as supporting the conclusion that the proceedings are non-adversarial and require a lesser standard of procedural protection. In particular, the respondent contrasts the rules applicable to the Immigration Appeal Division, constituted as a court of record under

Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84; 2002 SCC 3, at para. 82 which described the hearings before the Convention Refugee Determination Division, the RPD's forerunner, as "more inquisitorial in nature" in contrast to those before the IAD.
