Based on the analysis above I make the following findings on each of the issues.
- Although the order of questioning in refugee determination proceedings engages the security of the person interests of claimants, this case concerns classic administrative law issues that may be determined under the principles of natural justice and fairness without invoking the
Charter
. It is therefore not necessary for the Court to determine the scope and effect of fundamental justice under s. 7 with regard to the application of the Guideline. In the alternative, if a
Charter
analysis is required, fundamental justice does not require that the questioning order employed in the civil and criminal courts be extended to refugee determination hearings. The legislative intention to avoid the formalities attendant upon court proceedings is not inconsistent with the requirements of fundamental justice
- After considering the factors laid out by the Supreme Court in
Baker
and the further factors submitted by the applicants, it has not been established that natural justice requires that counsel for a refugee claimant be provided with the opportunity to question the claimant first. The opportunity for the applicant to make written submissions and provide evidence to the Board, to have an oral hearing with the participation of counsel, and to make oral submissions, satisfies the participatory rights required by the duty of fairness and Guideline 7 does not, in itself, breach that duty.
- While the language of Guideline 7 could be construed as mandatory in nature by inexperienced and less confident Board members, and although members may feel some top-down pressure to follow it, this does not lead to the conclusion that members consider themselves bound to apply the Guideline as if it were legislation, a regulation or a formal rule made under the Chairperson's authority. On the face of the record in this case, the evidence does not support a finding of fettering. Although fettering could be established in a particular case, the application of Guideline 7 in itself, does not fetter the discretion of Board members. Whether fettering has occurred must be established on a case-by-case basis.
- Administrative tribunals are free, within reason, to determine their own procedures as they are "masters in their own house" with respect to internal administrative procedures, subject to the proviso that they comply with the duty of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice. The Chairperson's authority to make guidelines is broad enough to encompass the adoption of a procedure such as the standard order of questioning contemplated by Guideline 7. As Guideline 7 does not constitute a mandatory pronouncement which fetters the members' discretion, it does not operate as a mandatory rule and as such remains within the Chairperson's authority.
- A reasonable apprehension of institutional bias does not arise merely because Board members conduct the questioning of refugee claimants in the absence of a refugee protection officer or in advance of claimants' counsel. In the particular circumstances of an individual case, aggressive questioning by the member or the refugee protection officer may amount to a breach of fairness, but the question of bias in this context has to be raised on a case-by-case basis. Whether a reasonable apprehension of bias is made out is to be decided by the judge hearing the merits of the case.
- The common law principle of waiver requires that an applicant must raise an allegation of bias or a violation of natural justice before the tribunal at the earliest practical opportunity. If counsel were of the view that the application of Guideline 7 in a particular case would result in a denial of their client's right to a fair hearing, the earliest practical opportunity to raise an objection and to seek an exception from the standard order of questioning would have been in advance of each scheduled hearing, in accordance with Rules 43 and 44, or orally, at the hearing itself. A failure to object at the hearing must be taken as an implied waiver of any perceived unfairness resulting from the application of the Guideline itself. If the objection was made in a timely manner at or before the hearing, the applicants are entitled to raise it as a ground for judicial review in their applications for leave. If the applicants failed to cite a denial of procedural fairness in their applications for leave, judicial review of the applications should be confined to the grounds on which leave was sought.
