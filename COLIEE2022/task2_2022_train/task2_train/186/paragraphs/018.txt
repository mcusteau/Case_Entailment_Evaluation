 [18] 
  Finally, should the Court find these proceedings constitute an abuse of process, it can deal with this problem in its reasons and by an appropriate order as to costs. A stay is not warranted in the circumstances of this case, and any other remedy, except costs, would be outside of the Court's narrow jurisdiction under subsection 18(1) of the  
 Citizenship Act
