  Justice Lebel, for his part, also insisted on the need for a contextual analysis. He summarized, in  
 Blencoe 
 , at para. 160: 
 
 
 
 "three main factors to be balanced in assessing the reasonableness of an administrative delay: 
 
 
 
 (a)  
 the time taken compared to the inherent time requirements 
  of the matter before the particular administrative body, which would encompass legal complexities (including the presence of any especially complex systemic issues) and factual complexities (including the need to gather large amounts of information or technical data), as well as reasonable periods of time for procedural safeguards that protect parties or the public; 
 
 
 
 (b)  
 the causes of delay beyond the inherent time requirements of the matter 
 , which would include consideration of such elements as whether the affected individual contributed to or waived parts of the delay and whether the administrative body used as efficiently as possible those resources it had available; and 
 
 
 
 (c)  
 the impact of the delay 
 , considered as encompassing both prejudice in an evidentiary sense and other harms to the lives of real people impacted by the ongoing delay. This may also include a consideration of the efforts by various parties to minimize negative impacts by providing information or interim solutions."
