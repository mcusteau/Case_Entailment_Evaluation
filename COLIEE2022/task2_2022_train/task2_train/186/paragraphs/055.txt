 [55] 
  Pursuant to paragraph 22(1)(f) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 ,  
 five years after their citizenship is revoked 
 , they would be able to make a new application for citizenship. Indeed, had the Plaintiff not delayed proceeding with the revocation of the Defendants' citizenship for several years, the Defendants could already have applied for, and might have obtained, Canadian citizenship again. Therefore, if these proceedings are not stayed, the Defendants' inability to apply for citizenship for the next five or more years will be a prejudice directly resulting from the Minister's delay.
