  Further, I find that the uncertainty which CIC entertained over the Defendants' status in Canada also led to its failure to process their daughter's H&C application. In January 2007, CIC took the position that s. 136 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
 , SOR/2002-227 ( 
 IRPR 
 ), which provides that if a would-be sponsor is subject to, inter alia, citizenship revocation proceedings, "the sponsorship application shall not be processed until there has been a final determination of the proceeding," prevented the processing of the H&C application. This position was based on a misunderstanding of section 136 of the  
 IRPR 
 , which does not apply to H&C applications. Nevertheless, but for the inordinate delay which affected them, the revocation proceedings against the Defendants would have concluded by 2007, and in all likelihood much earlier, so that CIC's misinterpretation of the  
 IRPR 
  would not have delayed the treatment of the Defendants' daughter's H&C application.
