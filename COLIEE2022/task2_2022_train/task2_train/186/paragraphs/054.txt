 [54] 
  The Defendants  
 cannot be deported 
  and would remain in Canada even if their citizenship were revoked: subsection 46(2) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27, provides that "[a] person who ceases to be a citizen under paragraph 10(1)(a) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 , other than in the circumstances set out in subsection 10(2) of that  
 Act 
 , becomes a permanent resident." Subsection 10(2) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
  refers to persons who obtained admission to Canada as permanent residents as a result of misrepresentation, fraud, or concealing material circumstances. Therefore, if the Defendants' citizenship is revoked, they will become permanent residents again.
