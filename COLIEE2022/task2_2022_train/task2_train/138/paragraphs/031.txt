  The first document submitted as new facts consists of the transcription of the Applicant's "day timer", which includes information detailing the number of hours worked by the Applicant on a monthly basis for the years 1998 through 2001, and handwritten notations concerning his medical condition during this time. The entries made prior to the August 27, 1998 decision said to be prepared by the Applicant were in his possession. These entries were the creation of the Applicant and the information contained therein was clearly known and therefore discoverable prior to the August, 27, 1998 decision. As a consequence, they do not constitute new facts under subsection 84(2) of the  
 CPP 
 . I come to the same conclusion with respect to the "day timer" entries made subsequent to August 27, 1998. While these entries were not in existence at that time and therefore not discoverable, they are of little assistance in addressing the Applicant's capacity to engage in substantially gainful employment as of May 1998. This is so because this information could not have been available to the Minister since it did not exist at the time of the decision. In the result, the information cannot be said to be material, that is to say "practically conclusive" with respect to the issue of whether the Applicant remained disabled within the meaning of the  
 CPP 
  on or after April 30, 1998.
