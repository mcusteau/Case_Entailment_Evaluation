The respondent highlights the discrepancies in the applicant's address on her application for employment authorization, her applications for a visitor visa, on the Confirmation of Offer of Employment, and on the employment contract dated March 1, 1988 between Victor Leung and the applicant. The respondent notes as well that no mention of the impending change of the employee/employer relationship was made on the Confirmation of Offer of Employment even though the applicant's employers at that time were only days away from immigrating and that the applicant had stated on her employment authorization application that Victor Leung was her employer from March 1984 to the present (August 15, 1988).
