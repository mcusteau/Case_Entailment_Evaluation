Following this refusal, counsel was retained by Mrs. Leung and a new offer of employment was made by her to the applicant on January 10, 1989. In response to enquiries made by counsel, the Commission for Canada advised that the reason for the applicant's refusal was that she had been working in Hong Kong since April 1988 without an employment contract from her new employer. The Commission's letter dated October 24, 1989 states that:
"Ms. Basco's application was refused at this office on September 9, 1988. In my opinion of the interviewing officer and the reviewing officer, she is not a suitable candidate under the Foreign Domestic Movement Program. Ms. Basco has been working in Hong Kong since April 1988 without an employment contract for a new employer, and without informing Hong Kong immigration. She confirms she was fully aware of immigration regulations in Hong Kong and claims your client, Mrs. Pinky Leung, who used to be her employer in Hong Kong was also aware of this unauthorized employment. Ms. Basco lacks maturity and credibility. She has shown little respect for Hong Kong Immigration Regulations. We doubt that she would, in turn, respect the law in Canada.
"A new job offer from your client was received in this office on January 27, 1989. A telex was sent on February 3, 1989 to the Canada Employment Centre in North York advising that we were maintaining our decision to refuse Ms. Basco's application and that we were not prepared to process the new application any further. We requested the CEC to notify your client."
