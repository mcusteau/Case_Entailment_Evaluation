Mr. Victor Leung, his wife, Pinky Law, and their two children immigrated to Canada in April 1988. The applicant remained in the employ of Mr. Leung's parents who, according to the applicant, had been living with Mr. Leung and his family since September 1984. On April 21, 1988 Pinky Law undertook a Confirmation of Offer of Employment in order to offer the applicant employment in Canada as a domestic worker and the applicant completed an application dated August 15, 1988 for an employment authorization under the Foreign Domestic Movement Program (the "FDM Program"). The applicant listed Mr. Victor Leung as her employer and indicated that in June 1988, they moved to 1B High Street, 8th Floor, Hong Kong. The Confirmation of Offer of Employment dated April 21, 1988, however, shows the applicant's address at that time as 1B High Street.
