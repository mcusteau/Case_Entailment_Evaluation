In his decision the Citizenship Judge gave the following reasons:
"The appellant is 476 days short of the required 1095. The reason for her absence is to visit her husband who is ill (see attached documents). This man is her second husband - he is not applying for citizenship. Her only family is the son in Toronto who cares for her and a daughter in New York. She received Returning Resident Permit during absence. It appears that her only home is with her son in Toronto. Her 2nd husband who is being looked after by
his
family lives in Israel. She meets residence requirements as per Thurlow."
