  The Applicants claim that in May 2004 representatives of the Karuna faction of the LTTE tried to extort money from them. Mrs. Balakumar informed her husband, who was still out of the country, and he told her to go to Colombo where he had arranged a place to stay. He subsequently joined them in Colombo and the family then left for the U.S. in early June 2004. It was not until mid-August 2004 that the family came to Canada.
