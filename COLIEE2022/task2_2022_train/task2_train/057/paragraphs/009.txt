  In respect of the standard of review, I accept the conclusions in  
 Sarker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 353, that the findings of credibility and existence of an IFA are subject to a standard of patent unreasonableness. However, whether the Board applied the correct test in finding an IFA is a question of law subject to a standard of correctness (see  
 Ezemba v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 1023). Likewise, whether there must, as a matter of law, be a separate s. 97 analysis is also a question of law and subject to the same standard of correctness.
