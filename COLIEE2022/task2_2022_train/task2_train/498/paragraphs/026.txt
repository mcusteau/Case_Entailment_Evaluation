In
Lopez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2007 FC 1341, [2007] F.C.J. No. 1733 (QL), at para. 21, I alluded to the importance of properly characterizing the alleged risks before conducting a state protection analysis in order to avoid short circuiting a full assessment of the claim. I am satisfied that the officer generally understood the risks as alleged by the applicant and properly characterized those risks as emanating from mafia elements in retribution for the applicant's previous work at the Commission for the Return of Land and Compensation to Legitimate Owners and because of his father's work as chairman of the local election committee.
