On the issue of hearsay, I emphasize that the declarations were made by government actors, a local mayor and a Member of Parliament, and thus the ability of the state to protect the applicant was within their personal knowledge, and cannot properly be characterized as hearsay evidence. These individuals are part of the state apparatus at the local and national levels, and, as such, are presumed to have knowledge of its protection capabilities.
