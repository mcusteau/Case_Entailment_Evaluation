It would appear that recent jurisprudence has not favoured use of a balance of convenience test in considering the issuance of a stay:
Sanwa Tekki Corp. v. Pacific Scientific Co.
(1984), 3 C.I.P.R. 154 (F.C.T.D.), at 155;
Jordan & Ste-Michelle Cellars Ltd. v. Andres Wines Ltd.
(1979), 45 C.P.R.(2d) 189 (F.C.T.D), at 193;
Inline Fiberglass Ltd. v. Omniglass Ltd.
(1993), 48 C.P.R.(3d) 214, at 215 (F.C.T.D. Protho.). The current approach, with which I agree, suggests that a stay should be granted to avoid the risk of conflicting adjudications, not overlapping proceedings:
94272 Canada Ltd. v. Moffatt
, [1990] F.C.J. No. 1013 (T.D. Protho.).
