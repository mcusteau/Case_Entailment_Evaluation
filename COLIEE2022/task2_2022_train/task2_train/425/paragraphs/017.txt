In the case before me, the parties are still in the process of exchanging amended pleadings, having not even proceeded to the discovery stage in the infringement action. As such, the expungement proceeding is likely to be heard and disposed of before the infringement action goes to trial. The expungement proceeding will result in a decision in rem concerning the validity of the registered marks, which should, to some extent, narrow the issues in the infringement proceeding:
