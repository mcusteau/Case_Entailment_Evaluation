Compulife filed its application for expungement, by way of originating notice of motion, on 27 July 1997. The trademarks at issue were granted to Compuoffice on 21 July 1995 (TMA 445,444) and 3 May 1996 (TMA 457,165). An earlier application for registration of the trademark "COMPUOFFICE", by Compuoffice, had been opposed by Compulife, and was abandoned.
