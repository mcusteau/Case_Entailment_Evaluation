According to the Guidelines, women who have suffered sexual violence may exhibit a pattern of symptoms referred to as Rape Trauma Syndrome. It appears that victims of sexual violence are often reluctant to disclose what has happened to them. On this matter, the Board did mention on the first page of its decision that it was mindful of the Guidelines. That being said, after a thorough reading of the impugned decision and of the transcript of the hearing, I am satisfied that the Board was sensitive to the factors which may influence the testimony of women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution. However, the Rape Trauma Syndrome does not excuse contradictions or omissions of serious incidents in a claimant's previous statements. It is clear that the Guidelines cannot be treated as corroborating any evidence of gender-based persecution so that the giving of the evidence becomes proof of its truth (Newton v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 738 (F.C.T.D.) (QL), at para. 18). In the case at bar, it appears that the number and nature of the several inconsistencies flowing from the applicant's previous statements go far beyond the applicant's alleged difficulty of remembering certain details of the alleged traumatic incident of March 2003 during her testimony. It is clear that the previous statements given by the applicant are inconsistent or contradictory and that the applicant adjusted or varied her testimony on key elements of her story. Consequently, as a whole, the Board's ultimate finding of non-credibility is not patently unreasonable.
