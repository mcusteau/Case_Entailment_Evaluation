It is important to consider the nature of the Committee's decision and the type of findings it made to which the Applicants object, either allegedly because the finding is not supportable or because there are insufficient reasons:
(a) The Committee concluded that the RPO position met Degree "D" (comprehensive knowledge) rather than "E" (thorough knowledge) of the applicable standard. The Applicants say that since RPOs require extensive, detailed and exhaustive knowledge, the Committee should have rated them at Degree "E".
(b) The Committee found BM 27 (benchmark position, Senior Entitlement Officer under the Employment Insurance Act, Degree "D") comparable to the RPO's required knowledge under its relevant Act. The Applicants challenge this selection of this "comparable".
(c) The Committee also considered the RPO's knowledge requirement against that of a Member of the IRB. The Applicants say that the Committee undervalued the RPO's knowledge requirement because, in uncontested matters, the RPO makes the same type of decision as a Member. They also argue with the Committee's conclusions as to the complexity of RPO decision-making function.
(d) Under the Decision Making and Organization Responsibility aspect of the Committee's findings, the Committee had to determine both the scope of the RPO function and the impact that RPO decisions and actions had. The Applicants quarrel with the level assigned to this factor (a "2" vs. a "3") as well as the Committee's determination that evaluation of operational efficiency is not a primary part of the RPO's function - they claim that it is at least a part of their function.
