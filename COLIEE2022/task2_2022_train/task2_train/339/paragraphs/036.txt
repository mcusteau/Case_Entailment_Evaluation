Horbay complains that he did not receive notice of the Committee's hearings. However, the evidence is that the notice was sent by mail on July 22, 2004. The evidence of sending and receipt of the notice is found in Horbay's July 28, 2004 e-mail in which his knowledge of the grievance hearing is evident - specifically, his question in the e-mail to his union "By what date will RPO nominees from Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver be determined as parties to the September 14 hearings?".
