In light of my view on the best interests of the children, it is not necessary to deal with the other issues in this matter. However, in my view, it was open to the Officer to make the findings of fact that she did. I am concerned about the Officer's statement that there was no submission on risk. There was a very limited submission but it was certainly within the Officer's discretion to refuse to refer an assessment of risk to the PCDO officer.
