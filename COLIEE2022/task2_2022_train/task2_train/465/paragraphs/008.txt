I see nothing in the paragraph that indicates that the Officer was looking at the ability of the children to communicate if they were returned to Sri Lanka. In my view, there has been no analysis of the best interests of the children by the Officer based on the evidence before her. Accordingly, the matter must be returned to a different officer for re-determination in a manner not inconsistent with these reasons. As provided in the Supreme Court of Canada ruling in
Baker
, the best interests of the children is an important factor but not necessarily the governing factor. The Immigration Officer will have to determine whether all the circumstances, including the best interests of the children, warrant the granting of an exemption from subsection 9(1) of the
Immigration Act
on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
