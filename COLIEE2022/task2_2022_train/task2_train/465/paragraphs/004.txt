In the Officer's handwritten notes she refers to the age and school of the two children. These handwritten notes were made at the time of interviewing the Applicants and their counsel. In her typewritten notes, which are more extensive, or the FOSS notes dated November 27, 2000, which is almost six months after the interview of April 12, 2000, the Immigration Officer stated:
"The Applicants have 2 children, ages 14 years and 15 years ... the children are co-applicants ... [The children] are both attending school in Canada."
She then stated later:
"While I empathize with the parent's concern that they do not want their children to live the lives they have lived, no evidence has been provided neither orally or in writing to indicate that the children would be at risk in Sri Lanka."
