The irreparable harm that counsel for the applicant submitted the applicant would suffer if the stay were not granted was that he faced persecution, and possibly death, if returned to Iran. As noted, the applicant had deserted the Iranian army; counsel submitted that this was a crime punishable by death in Iran. Also, counsel for the applicant noted that the applicant had converted from Islam to Christianity since coming to Canada, which would also be severely punished in Iran. Finally, the applicant had been convicted of narcotics offences in Canada, and counsel submitted on his behalf that the Iranian regime treats persons involved with narcotics with extreme sanctions including death, notwithstanding that they have been convicted and punished in accordance with the law of another state. Counsel for the applicant argued that the fact of having been declared a Convention refugee by the UNHCR was prima facie evidence of a reasonable fear of persecution on return to Iran.
