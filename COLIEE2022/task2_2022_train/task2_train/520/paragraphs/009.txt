The serious issue to be tried must relate to the judicial review application. At issue in the applicant's judicial review application is the Minister's opinion, issued pursuant to s. 70(5) of the
Act
, and not the deportation order. Claims related to the constitutionality of the actual deportation of the applicant cannot, therefore, be considered serious issues in the context of review of the Minister's opinion. As was found in
Nguyen v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1993] 1 F.C. 696; 151 N.R. 69 (F.C.A.), a decision involving a Minister's opinion, in that case pursuant to s. 46.01(1)(e)(ii) [see footnote 2] of the
Act
, does not imply or lead, in itself, to any action, such as deportation, which might affect life, liberty or security of the person.
