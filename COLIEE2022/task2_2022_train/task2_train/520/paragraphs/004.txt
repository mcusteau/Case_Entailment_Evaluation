The substance of the representations made on behalf of the applicant can be briefly summarized as follows. After only seven months of incarceration for the drug trafficking offences, the applicant was transferred to St. Leonard's Treatment Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, where he successfully completed a six-week intensive substance abuse treatment program. A letter from St. Leonard's Centre provided in part:
"... His participation in this process exceeded expectations; and his psychometric post test results indicated clear comprehension and positive change in knowledge and motivation. Throughout this period he was cooperative and pro social in interaction with staff and fellow clients."
The applicant had had no further negative contact with law enforcement officials since his release in September 1994. He maintained regular contact with his parole officer. A favourable letter from the parole officer was enclosed, which verified that the applicant had remained drug-free and cooperative. The applicant was married, with two Canadian children, and had moved from Toronto to Hamilton, apparently in part to separate himself from negative peer contact. The applicant had a full-time job; a letter from his employer stated in part:
"... He is a very respectable and presentable employee. He is very punctual and very well like [sic] by his co workers and customers. He is a very honest and hard working individual."
A newspaper clipping from the
Hamilton Mountain News
from September of 1995 highlighted the applicant's civic-mindedness and heroism in helping an elderly woman.
