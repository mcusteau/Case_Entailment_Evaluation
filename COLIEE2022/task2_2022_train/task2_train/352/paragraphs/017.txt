I am satisfied that a number of the Board's other negative credibility findings were not patently unreasonable. However, given the Board's statement that it was the cumulative effect of all of the negative findings that led to its conclusion that Mr. Qalawi's overall story was not credible, it is not possible to ascertain what effect the findings that I have found to have been made in error would have had on the Board's analysis and on its ultimate conclusion.
