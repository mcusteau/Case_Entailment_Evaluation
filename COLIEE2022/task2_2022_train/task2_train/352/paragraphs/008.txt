Mr. Qalawi purchased a plane ticket for his return to Jordan. He was scheduled to leave Canada for Jordan on June 28, 2005. However, shortly before his departure, two of Faten's brothers and a cousin announced that they were rejecting the agreement, telling Mr. Qalawi's father that they would kill his son if he were to return to Jordan. As a consequence, Mr. Qalawi decided to remain in Canada and seek refugee protection.
