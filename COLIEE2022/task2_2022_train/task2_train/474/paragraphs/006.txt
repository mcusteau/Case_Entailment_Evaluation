He was formally advised on the 8th of October, 1989, that the hearing before the Board would take place on February 15, 1990. He had been previously advised in September that the hearing would be some time in February. There are obviously not thirteen weeks left between the due date of presumptive release and the date orginally set for the hearing. It is undisputed that the date of February 15th was set in error and that as soon as the respondent became aware of the error, shortly after the 15th of February, the hearing was immediately rescheduled for the 19th of January, 1990. An earlier date was not set at the time, in order to ensure that the applicant would have sufficient time to prepare his case. When the present application was launched in the Federal Court, the hearing before the Parole Board was again rescheduled for the 6th of February in order to give the court time to rule as to whether or not the Parole Board still had jurisdiction in the matter.
