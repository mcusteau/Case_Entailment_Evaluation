  Justice de Montigny of this Court faced a similar situation in  
 Public Service Alliance of Canada v. Canada (Treasury Board) 
  (2005), 279 F.T.R. 242; 2005 FC 1297 where the investigator simply got the basic facts wrong, this was pointed out in the rebuttal but apparently ignored by the Commission who made a cryptic decision affirming the investigator's recommendations. At paragraph 50 of his Reasons Justice de Montigny said: 
 
 
 
 "50. I am of the view that this is a case where the omission was of such a fundamental character that the response filed by PSAC to the Investigator's Report could not rectify the problem. Not only was the Report extremely succinct on that issue, but it failed to provide sufficient information so that the rebuttal from PSAC could be meaningfully assessed. In any event, the Commission failed to address these issues and essentially ignored the position of PSAC."
