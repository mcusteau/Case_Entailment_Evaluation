  The Commission investigated the Applicant's complaint and, in a written decision dated February 9, 2007, determined that the CRA had accommodated the Applicant's disabilities in a reasonably timely manner. It is this decision which is the subject of this judicial review. For the reasons set out, I find that the decision of the Commission is to be set aside and sent back for redetermination.
