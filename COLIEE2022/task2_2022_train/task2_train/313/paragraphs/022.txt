The applicant contends NoÃ«l, J.'s (as he then was), rationale in
Canada (Treasury Board) v. Rinaldi
, [1997] F.C.J. No. 225; 127 F.T.R. 60 (T.D.), should be followed, and the only way to show the respondent's employment was
not
terminated under the
PSEA
would be to prove the conditions required to apply it were not present at the relevant time. In other words, the probationary employee (1) must prove he/she was not on probation; and (2) termination did not take place during the probationary period. The applicant further submits these are the only
two
operative conditions.
