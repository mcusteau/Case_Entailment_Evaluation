Counsel for the Attorney General submitted the Board must accept on its face that this is a rejection on probation in accordance with the
PSEA
, a matter over which an adjudicator appointed under the
PSSRA
has no jurisdiction. Accordingly, the burden of proof lies with the grievor to demonstrate bad faith. Counsel for the applicant noted the letter of rejection on probation speaks of "failure to meet the required standards" and this letter alone is sufficient to bar any Reference to Adjudication and establishes a presumption the employer has acted in good faith.
