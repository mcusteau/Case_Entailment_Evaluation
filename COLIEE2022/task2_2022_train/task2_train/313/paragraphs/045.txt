However, as I see it, the adjudicator required only that the employer demonstrate the rejection was for an employment-related reason, i.e. a dissatisfaction with the suitability of the employee and, as such, was acting in accordance with the provisions of the
PSEA
. He stated at page 11:
"To summarize, in my view it is incumbent upon the employer to demonstrate that section 28 of the
PSEA
, respecting rejection on probation for cause, has application.
Upon discharging that initial burden, the burden of proof then shifts to the grievor to demonstrate that the employer's actions are in fact a sham or a camouflage, and therefore not in accordance with section 28 of the
PSEA
. It is only upon the discharge of that burden that the adjudicator can take jurisdiction under section 92 of the
PSSRA
and consider the grievance on its merits."
