The case law clearly establishes that, absent special circumstances, judicial review does not lie from an administrative tribunal's interlocutory decisions. In
Szczecka v. Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration
(1993), 170 N.R. 58; 116 D.L.R.(4th) 333 (F.C.A.), LÃ©tourneau, J.A., held at page 335:
"This is why
unless there are special circumstances there should not be any appeal or immediate judicial review of an interlocutory judgment
. Similarly, there will not be any basis for judicial review, especially immediate review, when at the end of the proceedings some other appropriate remedy exists. These rules have been applied in several court decisions specifically in order to avoid breaking up cases and the resulting delays and expenses which interfere with the sound administration of justice and ultimately bring it into disrepute."
