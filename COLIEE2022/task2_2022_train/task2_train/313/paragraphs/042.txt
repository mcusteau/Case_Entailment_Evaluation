The respondent submits the employer must make a prima facie case that the grievor was terminated for just cause. This is not so. A distinction must be made between an employment related reason and "just cause". In
Canada (Attorney General) v. Penner
, [1989] 3 F.C. 429; 99 N.R. 213 (F.C.A.), a case involving the jurisdiction of the Board to hear a grievance of a probationary employee terminated for cause under section 28 of the
PSEA
. Marceau, J.A., stated at page 438:
"Other adjudicators have adopted quite a different attitude and accepted that
they had no jurisdiction to inquire into the adequacy and the merit of the decision to reject, as soon as they could satisfy themselves that indeed the decision was founded on a real cause for rejection, that is to say a bona fide dissatisfaction as to suitability
. In
Smith
(Board file 166-2-3017), adjudicator Norman is straightforward:
'
In effect, once credible evidence is tendered by the Employer to the adjudicator pointing to some cause for rejection, valid on its face, the discharge hearing on the merits comes shuddering to a halt. The adjudicator, at that moment, loses any authority to order the grievor reinstated on the footing that just cause for discharge has not been established by the Employer
