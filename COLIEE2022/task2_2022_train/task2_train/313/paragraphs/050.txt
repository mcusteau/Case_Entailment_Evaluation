Support for this procedure seems implicit in what Justice Marceau said about
Jacmain
in
Penner
at page 441:
"The basic conclusion of the
Jacmain
judgment, as I read it, is that an adjudicator appointed under the
P.S.S.R. Act
is not concerned with a rejection on probation,
as soon as there is evidence satisfactory to him
that the employer's representatives have acted, in good faith, on the ground that they were dissatisfied with the suitability of the employee for the position. And, to me, this conclusion follows inexorably from the legislation as it is." (emphasis mine)
