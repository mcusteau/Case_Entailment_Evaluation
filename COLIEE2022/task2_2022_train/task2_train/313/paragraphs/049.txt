I am also of the view that the procedure adopted by the adjudicator is an acceptable practice. In
Rinaldi
, supra, the employer lead with his objections: the grievor responded, and the employer replied. A review of the decision in
Michel Perreault (grievor) and Treasury Board (Transport Canada)
File 166-2-26094 also indicates the employer lead with his objections, to which the grievor responded. The same appears to be the case in the Board's decision in
Thomas Earle (grievor) and Treasury Board (Transport Canada)
File No. 166-2-27346.
