The Vice-Chairperson described the proceedings leading to the impugned decision in these terms at page 2:
"Counsel for the parties were invited to make submissions
respecting the burden of proof and the order of proceeding at this hearing
. The submissions were taken under advisement and the following day
I made my ruling on these issues which, in essence, directed the employer to provide some evidence as to the reasons for the purported rejection on probation
. The employer objected to this ruling and requested that it be issued in writing, and
that the hearing be adjourned in order to facilitate an application for review to the Federal Court
.
Counsel for the grievor indicated that she had no objection to the adjournment and to the issuance of a preliminary decision
. Accordingly, the hearing was adjourned sine die, and I undertook to issue this decision." (emphasis mine)
