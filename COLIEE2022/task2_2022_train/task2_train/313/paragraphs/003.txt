Transport Canada hired the respondent as an air traffic control trainee at the Toronto Area Control Centre at Lester B. Pearson International Airport. By letter dated February 9, 1996, Transport Canada offered Mr. Leonarduzzi an indeterminate appointment as an IFR trainee, subject to successful completion of the basic training programme at Transport Canada's Training Institute in Cornwall, Ontario. The third paragraph of that letter reads:
"Since you have been appointed
from outside the Public Service
you are
subject to a probationary period for the full duration of training
. As such, you are expected to meet the requirements of the Unit Qualification Training Program while at the Regional Training Unit (RTU) and in on-the-job training (OJT).
Failure to meet requirements will result in your being rejected while on probation
." (emphasis mine)
