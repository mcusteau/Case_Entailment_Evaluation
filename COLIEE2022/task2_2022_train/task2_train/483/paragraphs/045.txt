Turning first to the credibility issue, it is trite to say that decisions of the Board which are based on credibility findings are to be accorded a high level of deference given that the Board has the benefit of hearing the testimony of witnesses. As indicated in a number of decisions, credibility determinations lie within "the heartland of the discretion of triers of fact" and cannot be overturned unless they are perverse, capricious or based on erroneous findings of facts (Aguebor v. Minister of Employment & Immigration, [1993] F.C.J. no 732 (F.C.A.); Siad v. Canada (Secretary of State), [1997] 1 F.C. 608 (F.C.A.); Oyebade v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), [2001] F.C.J. no 1113; Sivanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. no 662 (F.C.).
