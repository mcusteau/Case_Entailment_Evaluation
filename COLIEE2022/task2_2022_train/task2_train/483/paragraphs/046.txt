Having said this, when a refugee claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there are reasons to doubt their truthfulness (Maldonado v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1980] 2 F.C. 302 (F.C.A.); Sathanandan v. Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration) (1991), 137 N.R. 13 (F.C.A.); Benoit v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. 923 (F.C.A.). As stated by Muldoon J. in Valtchev v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration), [2001] F.C.J. No. 1131 (FCTD), this presumption should not be cast aside lightly, and a tribunal must proceed with caution before relying on documentary evidence to disregard a sworn testimony. Muldoon J. notes at para 7:
A Board must be careful when rendering a decision based on lack of plausibility because refugee claimants come from diverse cultures, and actions which appear implausible when judges from Canadian standards might be plausible when considered from the claimant's milieu.
