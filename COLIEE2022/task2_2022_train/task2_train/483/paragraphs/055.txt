In its decision, the Board focused on the fact that the Applicant was previously raised in Colombo, was educated in English (which is still the language of commerce), could receive medical care, would be able to worship in her choice of religious facility, and receives a government pension.

It must be remembered that the Applicant is an elderly woman of 76, with no relatives in Colombo to protect her.
