  Under s. 19(1)(a) of the  
 Act 
  and s. 22 of the  
 Regulations 
 , it is the responsibility of two Medical Officers to form a medical opinion as to whether the child's medical condition would cause, or might reasonably be expected to cause, excessive demand on health or social services in Canada. The role of the Visa Officer, in this respect, is only to determine whether any obvious error was made in the formulation of the medical opinions, based upon the record before the Medical Officers (e.g. that they failed to consider all the medical reports available to them:  
 Lee v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1986), 4 F.T.R. 86 (T.D.)). In the absence of finding such an error, the Visa Officer will be bound by the medical opinions provided:  
 Gingiovenanu v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1995), 102 F.T.R. 76; 31 Imm. L.R.(2d) 55 (T.D.);  
 Ajanee v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
  (1996), 110 F.T.R. 172 (T.D.).
