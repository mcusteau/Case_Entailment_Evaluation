 [16] 
  The parties agreed only to ask for a question to be certified if my decision required an interpretation of the meaning of the term "excessive demand" in s. 22 of the  
 Regulations 
  which differed from existing interpretations found in other decisions of this court. As my decision did not turn directly on such an interpretation, no question shall be certified. 
 
 
 
 Application allowed.
