  The applicant submitted various letters and medical reports from Dr. Kerr Graham, Dr. R.B. Stillwater, and Dr. R.K. Watson, prepared on various dates between 1994 and 2003. The VRAB found that these letters and reports were credible, but they were nonetheless inadmissible as new evidence under the criteria enunciated in  
 MacKay v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1997), 129 F.T.R. 286 (T.D.). That case held that the criteria for admissibility of new evidence are: (1) the evidence should generally not be admitted if it could have been adduced earlier by due diligence; (2) the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial; (3) the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief; and (4) the evidence must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result. The VRAB found that the proffered evidence did not satisfy the second and fourth criteria.
