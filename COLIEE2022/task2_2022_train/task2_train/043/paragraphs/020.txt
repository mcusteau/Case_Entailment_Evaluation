  The respondent submitted that the  
 Pension Act 
  and Table of Disabilities, taken together, set out a generalized definition of a disability, the statutory mandate to create guidelines for determining the extent of disabilities, and objective criteria for that purpose. The respondent submitted that the hearing loss provisions in the Table of Disabilities can be read such that there is no conflict with its parent legislation. The respondent submitted that the Federal Court has previously found that the VRAB's reliance on the Table of Disabilities does not fetter the VRAB's discretion, as the Table of Disabilities are specifically authorized by legislation, namely subsection 35(2) of the  
 Pension Act 
  (see  
 Gavin v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1999), 170 F.T.R. 304 (T.D.), at paragraph 8).
