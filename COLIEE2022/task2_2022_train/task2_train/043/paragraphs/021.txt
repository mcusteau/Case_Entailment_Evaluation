  The respondent submitted that the standard of patent unreasonableness is applicable to decisions of the VRAB involving the interpretation of medical evidence (see  
 Caswell v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2004), 262 F.T.R. 58; 2004 FC 1364, at paragraph 17). The respondent submitted that the central and determinative piece of evidence before the VAB was an undated audiogram, taken at the time of the applicant's discharge in 1978, which showed a hearing loss of insufficient severity to constitute a disability. The respondent submitted that this evidence plainly contradicted all the subsequent medical evidence, and thus, the VRAB was entitled to reject the applicant's evidence (see  
 Caswell 
  at paragraph 26).
