  The applicant submitted that section 39 of the  
 Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act 
  mandates that a claimant is to be provided with the benefit of any reasonable doubt (see  
 Metcalfe v. Canada 
  (1999), 160 F.T.R. 281 (T.D.), at paragraph 17). This means that if the evidence is uncontradicted and is considered credible, the VRAB must accept it (see  
 Martel v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2004), 264 F.T.R. 89; 2004 FC 1287, at paragraph 41). The applicant submitted that in the present case, all of the medical evidence supported his contention that his hearing loss resulted from excessive exposure to loud noises during his years of military service, and no evidence was tendered with the VRAB to contradict this contention. The applicant submitted, therefore, that the VRAB committed a jurisdictional error when it failed to draw from the evidence every reasonable inference in favour of the applicant and failed to accept the uncontradicted medical evidence presented to it.
