  The applicant also referred to subsection 35(2) of the  
 Pension Act 
  which provides that "the assessment of the extent of a disability shall be based on the instructions and a table of disabilities to be made by the Minister for the guidance of persons making those assessments". The applicant submitted that the purpose of this provision is to provide a mechanism for quantifying the extent of a disability to promote a uniform standard of assessment (see  
 King v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2000), 182 F.T.R. 226 (T.D.)). The applicant submitted that rather than using the Minister's Table of Disabilities to quantify the extent of a disability, the VRAB effectively allowed the Table of Disabilities to supersede the definition of "disability" found in section 3 of the  
 Pension Act 
 . The applicant submitted that this is a reviewable error.
