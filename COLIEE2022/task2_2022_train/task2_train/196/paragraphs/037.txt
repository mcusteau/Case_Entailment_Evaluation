  The Board stated in its reasons that it recognized its obligation concerning the evidence under s. 39 of the  
 VRAA 
 . However, the reasons behind the Board's rejection of Dr. Sestier's opinion dealt with the medical consensus on that issue in "recognized medical literature" and "medical reference books." The Board did not identify which literature enabled it to reject Dr. Sestier's conclusion, where that literature is found, when it was published nor how the Board obtained it. The Board did not specifically refer to any study or medical text that could support its conclusion. It simply made a general statement without providing any details. What was obvious, however, was that the literature considered by the Board that allowed it to reject the applicant's evidence was not in the file.
