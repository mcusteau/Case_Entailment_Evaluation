  The Board effectively invoked other reasons to support its rejection of the applicant's application for a disability pension, such as the prior existence of other risk factors. Nonetheless, in my opinion, those other reasons could not be taken into account if the applicant's medical evidence had been rejected. In an application for a disability pension, the burden of proving the existence of a causal link between a pensioned condition and the condition for which a pension is sought lies with the applicant. By rejecting Dr. Sestier's opinion and by expressly stating that his theory was not part of the general medical consensus, the Board refused to accept that a link between chronic anxiety and coronary disease could objectively exist. From that moment, the Board could no longer acknowledge the existence of a causal link in the applicant's situation since it had just denied the objective existence of such a link. Therefore, the Board could not grant the applicant a pension in those circumstances since it had denied the existence of an objective causal link. That is why, in my opinion, the rejection of Dr. Sestier's opinion was a crucial error, notwithstanding the other reasons provided to reject the applicant's request.
