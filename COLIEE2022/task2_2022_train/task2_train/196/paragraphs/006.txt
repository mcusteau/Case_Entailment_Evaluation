  On June 2, 1997, the Minister of Veterans Affairs (the Minister) refused the applicant's request for a pension since, in his opinion, the applicant's coronary disease did not entitle him to a pension since it had not resulted from chronic anxiety. The Minister's conclusions in that regard were as follows:

 Coronary Disease 
 
 
 
 "You claim your coronary disease results from the chronic anxiety which already entitles you to a pension. 
 
 
 
 "Dr. Jacques Voyer suggested in his psychiatric report of March 31, 1997, that your coronary disease is most likely a result of your chronic anxiety. 
 
 
 
 "A medical advisor for the Department stated that no link between chronic anxiety and coronary disease existed. Here are some well-known risk factors of arteriosclerosis: hypertension, diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, smoking history, family history of heart disease, males generally over the age of 45, and lack of exercise. Psychiatric problems are not a risk factor of heart disease. 
 
 
 
 "The Department accepts Dr. Jacques Voyer's advice regarding the cause of your coronary disease but his observations on that matter are not corroborated by general medical books concerning its known causes and risk factors. 
 
 
 
 "Your request for a disability pension is therefore refused under paragraph 21(5) of the  
 Pension Act
