 [21] 
  In  
 MacDonald 
 , supra, Cullen, J., determined the following at paragraph 21 regarding the applicable standard of review when this court must review decisions made by the Board: 
 
 
 
 "On an application for judicial review, the court may not substitute its decision for that made by the board or tribunal which is under review. In light of the legislative framework which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Veterans Review and Appeal Board, as well as the privative clause which renders its decisions final and binding, the applicable standard of review is that of patent unreasonableness:  
 Weare v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (T-347-97, 11 August 1998). Thus, the reviewing court may interfere only in the event that the impugned decision was based on an error of law, or on an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it:  
 Hall v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (T-2267-97, June 22, 1998)." 
 
 
 
 Therefore, the applicable standard of review in this case is that of patent unreasonableness, as stated by the respondent.
