  In my view, the fact that s. 38 of the  
 VRAA 
  allows the Board to seek medical advice on any medical matter suggests that the Board has no particular medical expertise. That was acknowledged by jurisprudence, beginning with  
 Moar v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1995), 103 F.T.R. 314 (T.D.). Mr. Justice Heald's conclusion in  
 Moar 
 , supra, was cited in several cases, in particular in  
 Weare v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1998), 153 F.T.R. 75 (T.D.). MacKay, J.'s, comments at paragraphs 14 and 15 read: 
 
 
 
 "Under s. 38 of the  
 Act 
 , the Board may seek independent medical opinions regarding any matter before the Board. Mr. Justice Heald, in  
 Moar v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , (1995), 103 F.T.R. 314, at p. 316 commenting on a similar provision, s. 10(3) of the former, and now repealed  
 Veterans Appeal Board Act 
 , and its significance for the deference to be accorded by the court to the Board's decision, had this to say: 
 
 
 
 'The issue in this case clearly involves medical matters. Section 10(3) of the  
 Veterans Appeal Board Act 
  empowers the Board to obtain independent medical opinions relating to any matter before the Board. On this basis I conclude that the Board is not to be afforded the deference usually given to tribunals of a specialized nature because of their particular expertise.' 
 
 
 
 "That decision must be read in light of  
 Tonner v. Canada 
  (June 12, 1996), Court File No. A-263-95, [1996] F.C.J. No. 825 (F.C.A.), a decision of the Federal Court of Appeal, which held that the privative clause found in the former  
 Veterans Appeal Board Act 
  entitled that Board to deference. A similar clause is now found in s. 31 of the present  
 Act 
 . I conclude that the court is to defer to a decision of the VRAB, other than one concerning jurisdiction of the Board, unless it is patently unreasonable." (Notes omitted)
