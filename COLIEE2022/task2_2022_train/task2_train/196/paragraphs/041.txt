  In  
 Moar 
 , supra, Heald, J., concluded that the very existence of a provision similar to s. 38 of the  
 VRAA 
  suggested that the Board did not have any particular medical expertise and therefore could not be afforded deference from the courts. The Federal Court of Appeal later determined that the privative clause contained in the  
 VRAA 
  required deference from the court reviewing the Board's decision since that was the legislator's intent. That decision to give deference resulted solely from the existence of the privative clause and not from a reassessment of Heald, J.'s, reasons in  
 Moar 
 , supra, concerning the Board's medical expertise. In my view, the substance of Justice Heald's analysis concerning the Board's medical expertise still applies; the existence still today of s. 38 of the  
 VRAA 
  confirms that the Board does not have any specific medical expertise.
