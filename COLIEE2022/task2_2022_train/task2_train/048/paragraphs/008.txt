  Pursuant to s. 232(5) of the  
 Income Tax Act 
  I inspected the documents placed in the sealed package in order to determine whether they were covered by solicitor-client privilege, and if so, whether they fell within the statutory exemption for "an accounting record of a lawyer, including any supporting voucher or cheque" as provided by s. 232(1)(e).
