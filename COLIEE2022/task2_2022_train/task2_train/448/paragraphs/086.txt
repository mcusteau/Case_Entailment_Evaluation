Furthermore, based on the state of knowledge in 1985, I am satisfied that an average chemist would have been led directly to the conclusion, prior to such testing, that one enantiomer was likely to have more beneficial characteristics than the racemate, or the other optical isomer, in relation to the same beneficial qualities that had already been discovered, namely antimicrobial activity, solubility and toxicity. Therefore, in undertaking experimentation to verify which enantiomer possessed comparatively better qualities in these areas, no inventive step was involved.
