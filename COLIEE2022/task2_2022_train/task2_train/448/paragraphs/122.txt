[122]
Despite the fact that my determination on obviousness is sufficient to dismiss this application for a prohibition order, I will briefly address the issue of infringement. Both parties agree that the only claims at issue in relation to infringement are claims 2, 4, 7-9 and 17-19. As noted above, the process claims (1, 3, 5, 10 and 11) are not in issue. Claim 6 is also not in issue as it appears to claim a compound that is not levofloxacin due to the fact that "ethyl" is included in the formula rather than "methyl". Claims 12-16 are not at issue as the applicant conceded that they clearly relate to salts of levofloxacin.
