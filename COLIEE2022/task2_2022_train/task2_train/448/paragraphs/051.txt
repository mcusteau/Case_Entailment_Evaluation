What Fox and the jurisprudence suggest, in my view, when dealing with selection patents, is that in order to demonstrate sufficient inventive ingenuity, there must be discovered some
special
advantage or quality, previously unknown, or an advantage discovered for a new use, which constitutes a definite advance upon the knowledge already existing with regard to the original group or series. In
Pfizer Canada Inc. et al. v. Apotex Inc. et al.
(1997), 134 F.T.R. 201; 77 C.P.R.(3d) 547 (T.D.), Richard, J. (as he then was), found a selection patent valid that claimed the pharmaceutical preparation of fluconazole, the originating patent having claimed "an enormous class of compounds".
