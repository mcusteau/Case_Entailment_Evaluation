To understand the invention claimed in the patent at issue, certain chemistry terms and relationships must be understood. I have had the benefit of counsel's assistance and the expert affidavits filed by both sides. Janssen-Ortho's primary expert, Dr. Klibanov, is a Professor of Chemistry and Bioengineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Novopharm's expert, Dr. Caldwell, is the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Liverpool. Both experts have extensive credentials and background in pharmacology and organic chemistry. For convenience, definitions of the terms employed in these reasons, based on my understanding of the evidence, are set out in Annex "A" .
