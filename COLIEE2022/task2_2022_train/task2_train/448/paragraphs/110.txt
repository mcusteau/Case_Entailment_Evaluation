The applicants submit that certain "limiting" words are not required because the language that is employed in the '080 patent is sufficient to demonstrate that a chemist of ordinary skill in the art would never use the "S" or (-) symbol to designate a racemate. The S(-) designation indicates, instead, to an ordinary person skilled in the art that "practically all" of the molecules in the compound are of this configuration and "substantially free" of the molecules that have a "R" configuration. A chemist would also know that the solid wedge symbol indicates that "practically all" of the molecules have a "S" configuration. The claims of the '080 patent, according to Janssen, would be interpreted as covering an "optically pure form" of levofloxacin, since to achieve the invention's beneficial pharmacological effects one must use a pharmaceutical composition made of principally the S(-) enantiomer.
