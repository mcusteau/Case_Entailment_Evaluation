Dr. Caldwell also refers to the simplicity of the experiment to test for the solubility characteristics of a racemate. Again, Dr. Klibanov has not addressed the issue of whether the testing to confirm the properties of each enantiomer was routine, but rather focussed on the fact that in order to know with certainty the exact comparative nature of the enantiomers with the racemate, experimentation was required.
