Dr. Klibanov attested that the teachings of the '840 patent and the '892 patent can only result in racemic ofloxacin. At paragraphs 67 and 68 of his affidavit he continues:
"There are special techniques that must be used to make an optical isomer, and these techniques are usually compound-specific. In the early 1980s, making an optical isomer with high optical purity was extremely difficult. While there were various techniques known at that time, their successful application to a specific compound, especially that as complex [as] ofloxacin, was impossible to predict.
"Moreover, in many situations a specific methodology was required to be developed to obtain an optical isomer. Indeed, much of the '080 Patent is dedicated to describing processes used to obtain the novel ofloxacin optical isomers. For these reasons, I can unequivocally state that a person skilled in the art following the teachings of the '840 and '8[9]2 Patents would never obtain the optical isomers of ofloxacin because the processes set out in these patents result only in racemic ofloxacin."
He maintained this position on cross-examination. Dr. Klibanov also attested that any particular properties of either optical isomer of ofloxacin over and above the other isomer or the racemate were not disclosed in any piece of prior art referenced by Novopharm.
