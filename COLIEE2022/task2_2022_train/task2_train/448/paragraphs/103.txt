Dr. Caldwell and Dr. Klibanov both agree that the '840 patent would suggest, to an ordinary chemist skilled in the art, that ofloxacin was a chiral compound and possessed optically active isomers. Where they disagree is whether this understanding inevitably includes a recognition of the benefits of one enantiomer over the other enantiomer, and over the racemate, and whether a useful process for isolating and making one enantiomer is "so clearly" disclosed from the teaching of a piece of prior art that it is anticipated.
