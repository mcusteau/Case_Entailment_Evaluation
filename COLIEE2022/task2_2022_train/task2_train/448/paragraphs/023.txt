As held by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Whirlpool et al. v. Camco Inc. et al.
, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1067; 263 N.R. 88, and
Free World Trust v. Electro Sant√© Inc. et al.
, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 1024; 263 N.R. 150, a patent claim is to be construed in a "purposive" way, which involves a realistic construction of the language of the claims through the eyes, and with the learning, of a person skilled in the art (para. 44
Whirlpool
, supra). Moreover, the Court may look at the entire specification of the patent in order to understand the words as stated in any disputed claim, provided this does not enlarge or contract the scope of the actual patent claims.
