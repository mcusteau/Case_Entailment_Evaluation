At the heart of the dispute between the parties as to the construction of the '080 patent is whether it claims the levorotatory optical isomer, as found or already disclosed within racemic ofloxacin (Novopharm's position) or claims such enantiomer as a separate, inventive compound (Janssen's position). Related to that question is the issue of whether "S(-)" as used to describe the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin can be construed to mean the S(-) isomer in a substantially pure form.
