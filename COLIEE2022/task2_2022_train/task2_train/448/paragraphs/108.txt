In my opinion, neither the '840 patent, the US '892 patent, nor the Osada reference, considered separately, provide all the information that a person of ordinary skill in the art would require in order to be led to the '080 patent. It is therefore novel and the claims set out in the '080 patent were not anticipated by the three pieces of prior art cited by Novopharm. Janssen has demonstrated that the allegation of invalidity on this ground is not justified.
Other Grounds of alleged invalidity
Alleged Ambiguity and allegation that claims broader than disclosed invention
