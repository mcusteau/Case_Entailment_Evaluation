[125]
Dr. Klibanov's affidavit evidence is that claim 17 cannot be limited to hydrates of a salt of levofloxacin and that Novopharm's product, as a hemihydrate of levofloxacin, will literally be within the scope of claims 2 and 17, as well as claims 4, 7-9, 18 and 19. Since Novopharm admits it will make tablets that contain levofloxacin hemihydrate together with a carrier, its product will also infringe claim 18 of the patent.
