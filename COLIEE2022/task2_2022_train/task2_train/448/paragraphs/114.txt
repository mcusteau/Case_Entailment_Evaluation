In my opinion, the '080 patent is not invalid on this ground. A person skilled in the art, reading the claims in the '080 patent, would understand that the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin in an optically pure form is described, as it is only when a substantial optical purity is present that the S(-) enantiomer becomes distinguishable from the racemate and the R(+) optical isomer. Janssen has satisfied me, on a balance of probabilities, that Novopharm's allegation of invalidity on the basis of ambiguity, because the patent lacks a definition or specification of optical purity, is not justified.
