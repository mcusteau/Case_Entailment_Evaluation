The applicant argues that it is clear that Novopharm's product, described in the NOA as levofloxacin hemihydrate made using "the free acid form" of the compound rather than a salt of the compound, will infringe claims 2 and 17 of the '080 patent. These, it asserts, are interdependent and both include the hemihydrate form of levofloxacin. The formula in claim 2, together with a 1/2 mole of water constitutes levofloxacin hemihydrate. Claim 17 relies on claim 2 where the compound is a hydrate.
