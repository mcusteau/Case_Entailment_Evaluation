In
Sharp & Dohme Inc. v. Boots Pure Drug Co.
(1928), 45 R.P.C. 153 (C.A.), Lawrence, L.J., of the English Court of Appeal stated as follows at 191-92:
"In my opinion, the ascertainment of the valuable properties of a chemical substance (important as it may be from the point of view of utility, where it is desired to obtain a patent for an entirely new substance) is not of itself, especially when such substance is one which anybody is entitled to make, a patentable invention, but at most a discovery. The Plaintiffs, when they obtained their four alkyl bodies by [published art] method, no doubt put them through the usual well-known tests to establish their identity and their respective therapeutic value."
