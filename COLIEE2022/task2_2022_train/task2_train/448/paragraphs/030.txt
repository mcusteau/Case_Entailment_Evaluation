With respect to the question of whether "S(-)" - as used to describe the levo-enantiomer of ofloxacin in the '080 patent - can be construed to mean S(-) in a substantially pure form, I accept that proposition. A chemist skilled in the art when reading "S(-)-pyridobenzoxazine compound" as described in a particular formula would, in my opinion, accept that such compound is principally made up of the S(-) enantiomer of a racemic compound, wherein the optical activity of the S(-) enantiomer is not only detectable, but dominant. The lack of numeric quantification of the purity level of the S(-) enantiomer is not fatal to distinguishing this compound from either the racemic compound or the R(+) enantiomer.
