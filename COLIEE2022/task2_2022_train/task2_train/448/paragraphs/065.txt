Dr. Caldwell determined that the testing employed in the '080 patent for solubility, antimicrobial activity and toxicity levels of the enantiomers was done using simple, analytical procedures that did not involve any inventiveness. Dr. Klibanov did not address whether the experiments that were performed to determine the properties of the levorotatory isomer of ofloxacin were relatively simple ones. He only addressed the issue, as I read his affidavit and cross-examination, of the isolation of the distinct S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin, finding that this was difficult to do and not disclosed by any previous ofloxacin patent.
