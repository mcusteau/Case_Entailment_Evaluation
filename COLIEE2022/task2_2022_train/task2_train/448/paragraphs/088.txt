[88]
While my conclusion above concerning obviousness is enough to determine this application, I will address the remaining issues in this proceeding. Paragraphs 27(1)(b) and 61(1)(a) of the pre-1989
Patent Act
are applicable with respect to anticipation. The application for the '080 patent was filed on June 19, 1986, therefore any prior art referenced by Novopharm must be either a patent issued two years before this filing date, that is June 19, 1984, or a published paper or article made available to the public before June 19, 1984. Any document that was not published and available to the public before June 19, 1984 cannot be relied upon for anticipation.
