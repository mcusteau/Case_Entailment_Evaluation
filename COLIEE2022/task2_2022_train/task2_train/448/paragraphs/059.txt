Dr. Klibanov, Janssen's expert, does not address these U.S. patents in his affidavit but instead only refers to another piece of prior art cited by Novopharm in its NOA, the Japanese patent application No. 59-219293. He stated that the optical isomer disclosed in that application is a compound that is very different from ofloxacin and that this reference does not indicate any advantages of one optical isomer over the other isomer or the racemate.
