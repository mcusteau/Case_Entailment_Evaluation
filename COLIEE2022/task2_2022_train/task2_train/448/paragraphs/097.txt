Janssen's expert, Dr. Klibanov, agrees that even though the '840 patent does not expressly indicate that ofloxacin is a chiral compound, "this would be apparent to an ordinary chemist based on the chemical structure of ofloxacin" (para. 64 of his affidavit). Novopharm points to Klibanov's cross-examination where he acknowledges that a chemist having read through the '840 patent would understand that the structure therein shown was a racemate.
