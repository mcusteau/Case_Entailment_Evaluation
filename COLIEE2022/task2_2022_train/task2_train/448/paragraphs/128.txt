In my opinion, Novopharm's interpretation cannot be accepted. As Janssen has pointed out, Novopharm's expert Dr. Caldwell in fact acknowledged in cross-examination that levofloxacin hemihydrate is within claim 17. Novopharm has described its product in the NOA as levofloxacin hemihydrate. Further, Novopharm's interpretation ignores the final words of claim 17: "wherein said compound is a hydrate." The proper construction of claim 17 covers levofloxacin, in any hydrate form, including pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, but is not necessarily limited to the salts. However, I do not accept Janssen's contention that "S(-)" - meaning principally S(-) or the S(-) optical isomer of ofloxacin in a substantially pure form - means water cannot exist in the compound form. The '080 patent expressly states that the compound when it is a hydrate is included within claim 17.
