Another term for describing optical isomers is "enantiomer" . An enantiomer is one of a pair of non-superimposable mirror images; by analogy, one's hands. Compounds that exhibit this quality are called "chiral". They possess a chiral centre and in carbon compounds, such as ofloxacin, the chiral centre is a carbon atom that is bound to four different atoms or groups of atoms, where all four groups are different. Chirality confers a specific three-dimensional shape on a molecule.
