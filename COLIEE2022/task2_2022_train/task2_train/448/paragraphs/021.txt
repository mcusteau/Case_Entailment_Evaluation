The applicant's reliance on the Supreme Court's reasoning in the
Schmeiser
and
Wellcome
decisions, with regard to the burden of proof, is not helpful in my view, as both were patent actions for declarations of invalidity and infringement. I do not agree that such reasoning is directly applicable in a NOC proceeding, which has been held to be akin to a summary proceeding by way of an application, involving its own unique set of principles and regulations, and where any finding regarding infringement or validity is not determinative of that matter in any subsequent patent action. As held in
Merck Frosst
, supra, at 319 [C.P.R.], a NOC proceeding is not an action and its object is "solely to prohibit the issuance of a notice of compliance under the
Food and Drug Regulations
."
