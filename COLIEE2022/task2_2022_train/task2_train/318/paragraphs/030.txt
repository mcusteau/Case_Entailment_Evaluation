What is required is to define the nature of the remedy available in the circumstances where a legitimate expectation is claimed. Nevertheless, it is clear that the principle of legitimate expectation is nothing more than a restatement of the fundamental duty to act fairly. In the case at bar the plaintiff is not asking to be given an opportunity to submit comments on the nonrenewal of his contract but is instead arguing that he has acquired a fundamental right to a permanent position. He relies not only on the promise made to him but also on the administrative policy that a contract employee with more than five years of continuous service should automatically be given a permanent position: in his submission, this practice should have been applied to his situation.
