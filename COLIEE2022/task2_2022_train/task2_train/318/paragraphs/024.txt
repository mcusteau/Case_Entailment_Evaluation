He stated that the plaintiff was hired on a term basis and that this term was generally renewed annually. However, when the Department of Agriculture realized in March 1985 that certain problems would shortly arise in the management of its employees it decided to extend Mr. Girard's term for a six-month period, to September 30, 1985. He was sent a letter to this effect clearly indicating that his employment was on a term basis and he should not expect to have a permanent position in the Public Service. Subsequently this term was cautiously renewed again to December 31, 1985. Counsel referred to Mr. Bérubé's testimony stating that he had renewed Mr. Girard's term from September 30 to December 31, 1985, only because he had to hold a competition to determine who would be moved from Rimouski to Saint-Charles. Mr. Bérubé also testified that the Department was entirely satisfied with Mr. Girard's services and that if he had had the power to keep him he would willingly have done so, but he had no choice since he had to reassign a permanent employee. Further, as Miss Pasteris stated in her testimony, only the Public Service Commission in Ottawa had the power to appoint someone to a higher position without a competition.
