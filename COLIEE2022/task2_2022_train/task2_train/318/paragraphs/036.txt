Martineau and Butters v. Matsqui Institution Inmate Disciplinary Board
, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 118; 14 N.R. 285, the Supreme Court had to consider the nature and consequences that might result from a directive creating certain rules of procedure intended to apply to the imposition of penalties by disciplinary boards at the Matsqui Institution. As Pigeon, J., speaking for a majority of five judges, explained at p. 129:
"I have no doubt that the regulations are law. The statute provides for sanction by fine or imprisonment ...
"I do not think the same can be said of the directives. It is significant that there is no provision for penalty and, while they are authorized by statute, they are clearly of an administrative, not a legislative nature."
