The Department of Agriculture terminated the plaintiff's contract for the following three reasons. First, the federal Department of Agriculture in the Québec region in March 1985 had to undertake a reorganization of its permanent staff on account of the closure of an abattoir and a surplus of two person-years in the fields of poultry farming and dairy products. Second, in November 1985 the Department notified its Québec managers that 11.75 person-years would have to be deducted from staff in the Agricultural Inspection Division for the fiscal year beginning on April 1, 1986. Third, the reorganization of staff occasioned both by the strike and by departmental constraints as well as the person-years reduction affected certain permanent employees who had to take a transfer to a location some distance away. In accordance with collective agreements and various internal policies, it is customary in the Public Service Commission to protect permanent employees.
