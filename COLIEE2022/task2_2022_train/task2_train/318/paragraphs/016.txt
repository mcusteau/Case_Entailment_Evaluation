By a letter dated October 6, 1987, Mr. François Planté notified Mr. Jean Benoît, investigations chief for the Public Service Commission, that there had been an interruption in the plaintiff's service due to the cuts and to the strike which began at Saint-Henri on December 8, 1985. He explained that the Department had to protect its permanent employees who had become vulnerable and that it had been decided to abolish two positions, namely that of the plaintiff in Saint-Charles and that of Miss Drouin at Vallée-Jonction, and replace them by a single position.
