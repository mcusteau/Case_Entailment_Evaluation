A legitimate expectation may exist as a consequence of a promise made by a public authority or as the result of a current practice which should be applied if it is reasonable to do so. Lord Diplock explained the concept as follows at p. 408:
"To qualify as a subject for judicial review the [challenged] decision must ... affect [a] person ... by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either (i) he had in the past been permitted by the decision-maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment; or (ii) he has received assurance from the decision-maker that he will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn."
