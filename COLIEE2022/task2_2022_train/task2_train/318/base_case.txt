Summary:
This case is unedited, therefore contains no summary.
[1]
Tremblay-Lamer, J.
: The Defendant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, seeks to quash the Plaintiff's action on the basis of paragraph 221(1)a) of the Federal Court Rules, 1998, SOR/98-106 ("the Rules") because the Plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action.
[2]
The Plaintiff's action is based on the Defendant's failure to follow its Policy on Claims and Ex Gratia Payments. According to the Plaintiff, this policy binds the Defendant and damages result from its failure to comply with it.
[3]
Contrary to a statute or a regulation, a policy does not have the force of law. This is confirmed by the jurisprudence of this Court which makes it clear that a policy is administrative in nature and as such, it is not enforceable. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
[4]
In the case at bar, the Plaintiff seeks to have the Defendant's policy enforced, which it cannot do in light of the above-mentioned jurisprudence. Thus, as the Plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action, his action is quashed pursuant to paragraph 221(1)a) of the Rules.
ORDER
[5]
The Plaintiff's action is quashed pursuant to paragraph 221(1)a) of the Federal Court Rules, 1998.
