  The absence of fairness and natural justice, which the applicant alleges in her Notice of Application, would seem to be ongoing. This is one of the reasons why the plaintiff wishes to convert this judicial review proceeding into action and to proceed through the complete array of procedure leading to the trial of this matter as an action. Given the views of Mr. Justice Lemieux this matter ought to be settled. I would also observe that only a small percentage of actions commenced actually conclude with a trial before a judge, but rather are settled and that the vast majority of settlements occur once each side has examined and has been examined for discovery, for then there may be full assessments by counsel and clients. Now this excursion into settlement while not a direct benefit in the sense of showing that affidavit evidence is inadequate, is certainly an overall benefit to the Court which has finite judicial resources: affidavit evidence and cross-examination on affidavits may be inadequate in order to bring about a settlement.
