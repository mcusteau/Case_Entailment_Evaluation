  In the present instance a major concern is the existence of two letters, both written after this judicial review proceeding was commenced. The first is dated 5 April 2003 and is signed by Members of the Kitasoo-Xaixais Police Board. It is directed to someone at the Kitasoo Community School, raising concerns about Ms. Edgar being in attendance at the School and the immediate area during school hours, Ms. Edgar having been asked to attend at the Community School to assist with an event. That letter refers to Ms. Edgar presently being before the courts for trafficking in a narcotic. In effect the letter bans Ms. Edgar from attending at the School or in the immediate area during school hours. Counsel for Ms. Edgar tenders the letter as evidence of ongoing harassment.
