  The Court of Appeal in  
 Drapeau v. Canada (Minister of National Defence) 
  (1995), 179 N.R. 398 (F.C.A.), did add to  
 MacInnis 
  by pointing out that s. 18.4(2) "places no limits on the considerations which may properly be taken into account in deciding whether or not to allow a judicial review application to be converted into an action." (page 399). There, among the factors which the trial judge had properly taken into account, included the desirability of facilitating access to justice and also in converting judicial review, which could deal with only one decision, into an action. which might deal with a series of decisions which caused damage to the plaintiff, thus allowing the plaintiff to proceed by way of one action, instead of by way of a multiplicity of judicial review proceedings. In the present instance, while the Band Council and the Kitasoo-Xaixais Police Board appear to have made subsequent unilateral decisions prejudicial to Ms. Edgar, she raises only one issue for judicial review.
