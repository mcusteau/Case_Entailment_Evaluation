  Though the Court has sympathy for the Applicant's situation, it was his responsibility to submit to the visa officer in New Delhi conclusive proof of the fact his brother was living in Canada that met the objective evidentiary criteria as laid out by the visa officer in New Delhi. The Applicant has failed to do so both in his application and in his request for reconsideration, and consequently his application for judicial review is denied.
