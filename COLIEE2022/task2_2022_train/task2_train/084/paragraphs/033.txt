  An administrative decision maker cannot fetter the exercise of its statutory discretion unless authorized to do so under legislative authority. However, it is not inappropriate for administrative decision makers to take into account guidelines and policies which can enhance the quality of administrative decision making by reducing inconsistencies in the treatment of applications. If the administrative decision maker treats the guidelines or policy as immutable without the need to consider any other factors which may apply to the particular circumstances of a given case, then it may be found that the decision maker fettered discretion:
