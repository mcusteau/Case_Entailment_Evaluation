  If any duty of fairness applied here, it had been met by the clear notice of May 15, 2008 informing the Applicant of the type of documentation which would be considered for establishing his brother's residence in Canada. The Applicant was thus treated fairly and the visa officer was under no supplemental duty to send the Applicant a second notice when he had disregarded the first.
