  With respect to judicial review of decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Jerome, A.C.J., held in  
 Lukian v. Canadian National Railway Co. 
  (1994), 80 F.T.R. 38 (T.D.): 
 
 
 
 "Generally, when Courts are called upon to review the exercise of an administrative tribunal's discretionary power, they will be reluctant to interfere since tribunals, by virtue of their training, experience, knowledge and expertise, are better suited than the judiciary to exercise those powers. Provided the Commission's decision is within the discretion given to it, the Court will not interfere with the manner in which it was exercised, unless it can be shown the discretion was exercised contrary to law. What the law requires is the Commission to consider each individual case before it, to act in good faith,  
 to have regard to all relevant considerations 
  and not be swayed by irrelevant ones, and to refrain from acting for a purpose contrary to the spirit of its enabling legislation or in an arbitrary or capricious manner." (emphasis mine)
