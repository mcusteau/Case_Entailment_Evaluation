  Counsel takes the position that even if the Commission's decision to close the file was wrong, it was not so unreasonable or perverse or based on irrelevant or improper facts as to warrant the intervention of this court. Counsel points to  
 Bull v. Kingston Prison for Women Disciplinary Tribunal (Chairwoman)  
 (1986), 7 F.T.R. 278 (T.D.), and  
 Martineau v. Canada 
  (1989), 31 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.), for the proposition that the purpose of judicial review in this context is not to question the wisdom of the decision below or to reweigh the evidence and substitute its view for that of the Commission; rather, it is to verify whether the process by which the decision was reached and the factors taken into account were fair and reasonable. Counsel notes in this respect that the applicant had every opportunity to make submissions to the Commission and she exercised that opportunity. Further, there is no suggestion that the investigation report is incomplete, inaccurate or misleading.
