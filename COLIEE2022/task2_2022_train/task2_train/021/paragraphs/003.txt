  On January 22, 1990 [see footnote 1], the applicant made a formal complaint to the Commission, alleging that the Mint discriminated against her because of her sex by not providing her with a harassment free workplace and by treating her differently in the course of her employment, in contravention of ss. 7 and 14 of the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 . The complaint [see footnote 2], written by Ms. Bougie and signed by the applicant, outlines the circumstances of her alleged sexual harassment at the Mint, the internal complaint procedures that she allegedly followed to no avail, and the alleged harm to her career as a result of the harassment, including an alleged denial of promotion and a poor performance evaluation which the applicant claims amounted to constructive dismissal. The applicant submitted in her complaint that, because of the stress related to the alleged harassment, she had been unable to work since April 3, 1989, and has been off on sick leave. In her affidavit of March, 1994 [see footnote 3], the applicant claimed that she was still unable to work; it appears that since her sick leave ran out, she has received long-term disability insurance payments. In the spring of 1990, the Mint filled the applicant's position on a permanent basis.
