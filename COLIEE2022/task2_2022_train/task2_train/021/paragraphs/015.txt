  Nadon, J., in  
 Slattery  
 v. Canadian Human Rights Commission 
  (1994), 73 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.) and Teitelbaum, J., in  
 Boahene-Agbo v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al. 
  (1994), 86 F.T.R. 101 (T.D.), cases that involved decisions of the Canadian Human Rights Commission regarding whether to proceed with complaints, both quoted from McIntyre, J., in

 "It is, as well, a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. Where the statutory discretion had been exercised in good faith and, where required, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the courts should not interfere." 
 
 
 
 Teitelbaum, J., noted that the jurisprudence is also clear that courts may review the exercise of discretionary powers where such power has been exercised in a discriminatory, unfair, capricious or unreasonable manner.
