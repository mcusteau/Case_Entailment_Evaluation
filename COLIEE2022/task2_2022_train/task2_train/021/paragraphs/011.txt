  According to counsel, it was proper for the Commission to take into account the decision of Mr. Justice Chadwick. That judgment revealed facts relevant to the complaint before the Commission, including admissions by the applicant. The judgment was before the Commission when it made its determination. Not to have taken the judgment into account would have been a reviewable error, as the judgment was a comprehensive judicial inquiry into the very issues raised in the complaint, wherein the applicant was represented by experienced counsel. In any event, the Commission did not defer or abdicate its decision-making responsibility to the Ontario court. The Commission conducted an independent investigation and interviewed witnesses.
