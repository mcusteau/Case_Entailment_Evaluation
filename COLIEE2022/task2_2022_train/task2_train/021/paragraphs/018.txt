  In  
 Slattery 
 , supra, at 20 to 23, Nadon, J., required the elements of neutrality and thoroughness to be present in the Commission's investigation as these elements are necessary to provide a fair basis on which the Commission evaluates whether a tribunal should be appointed pursuant to s. 44(3)(a) of the  
 Act 
 . With regard to neutrality, it has been held that if the Commission simply adopts an investigator's conclusions without giving reasons, and those conclusions were made in a biased manner, a reviewable error occurs:  
 Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al. 
  (1993), 71 F.T.R. 214 (T.D.). The requirement of thoroughness of investigation is discussed in  
 Slattery 
  and stems from the essential role that investigators play in determining the merits of particular complaints. In determining the degree of thoroughness of investigation required to be in accordance with the rules of procedural fairness, the interests of the complainant and the respondent must be balanced with the Commission's interest in maintaining an administratively workable system. Deference must be given to administrative decision-makers to assess the probative value of evidence and to decide whether to further investigate accordingly. Only where unreasonable omissions have been made, such as the failure to investigate crucial evidence, is judicial review warranted. In instances where parties have the legal right to make submissions in response to an investigator's report, parties may be able to compensate for minor omissions by bringing them to the attention of the decision-maker. Therefore, only where complainants are unable to rectify such omissions should judicial review be considered.
