  The case before me has a long history. Throughout its various chapters, the subjective elements are certainly of a kind to provoke human understanding and compassion, no matter how otherwise objective and dispassionate must be the judicial determination of any human rights issue. Parliament, in adopting the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , delegated to the Commission the duty to investigate any complaint made to it. In my view, the Commission fully respected its mandate in dealing with the applicant's case and in deciding, in the exercise of its own discretion, not to deal with it any further. There might be some other means available to the applicant to provide her with some measure of comfort, assurance or reparation to which she feels entitled. Regretfully, judicial review is not one of them.
