  As regards the thoroughness of the Commission's investigation, I need only quote what was said by Teitelbaum, J., in  
 Boahene-Agbo 
 , supra, in describing the process by which the Commission makes its decision as to whether to pursue a complaint: 
 
 
 
 "When coming to its decision under section 44(3), the Commission is entitled to consider the investigator's report, such other underlying material as it, in its discretion, considers necessary and the representations of the parties. The Commission is then obliged to make its own decision based on this information. By doing so, it 'weighs' the evidence before it."
