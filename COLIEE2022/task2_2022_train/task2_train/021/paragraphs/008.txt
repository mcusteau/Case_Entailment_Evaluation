 [8] 
  In a letter dated November 18, 1993, the Commission advised the applicant that it would not be proceeding with her complaint against the Mint. The applicant applies to this court for judicial review of that decision. 
 
 
 
 Issues: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the Commission err in its consideration of the decision of Chadwick, J., in the case before the Ontario Court (General Division)? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Commission err in law by dismissing the complaint without taking it to a tribunal or to conciliation? 
 
 
 
 3. Was the Commission's failure to give reasons for its decision to close the complainant's file a reviewable error?
