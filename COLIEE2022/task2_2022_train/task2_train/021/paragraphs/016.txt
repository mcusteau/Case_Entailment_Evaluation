  Nadon, J., also held in  
 Slattery 
  that: 
 
 
 
 "In the spirit of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Mossop 
  [see footnote 8], deference must prevail over interventionism insofar as the CHRC deals with matters of fact-finding and adjudication, particularly with respect to matters over which the CHRC has been vested with such wide discretion, as in the case of the decision whether or not to dismiss a complaint pursuant to subparagraph 44(3)." 
 
 
 
 Nadon, J., concluded: 
 
 
 
 "There is no evidence before me indicating that the CHRC failed to consider the material that was contained in the applicant's submission of February 6, 1992, nor am I convinced that the CHRC's decision to dismiss the complaint was the result of bad faith, irrelevant considerations or improper purposes. I am furthermore not convinced that the decision was unreasonable in light of all the material that was before the CHRC. The CHRC simply exercised its discretion and made a decision that was open to it to make based on the evidence before it."
