  The  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
  confers discretion on the Commission, both in terms of decisions as to whether to pursue a complaint and in terms of decisions as to the appointment of a conciliator. The relevant provisions read as follows: 
 
 
 
 "44(1) An investigator shall, as soon as possible after the conclusion of an investigation, submit to the Commission a report of the findings of the investigation. 
 
 
 
 "(3) On receipt of a report referred to in subsection (1), the Commission 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 (b) shall dismiss the complaint to which the report relates if it is satisfied  
 
 
 
 (i) that, having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint, an inquiry into the complaint is not warranted, or 
 
 
 
 (ii) that the complaint should be dismissed on any ground mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e). 
 
 
 
 "41. Subject to section 40, the Commission shall deal with any complaint filed with it unless in respect of that complaint it appears to the Commission that 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 (d) the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith; 
 
 
 
 "47(1) Subject to subsection (2), the Commission may, on the filing of a complaint, or if the complaint has not been 
 
 
 
 (a) settled in the course of investigation by an investigator, 
 
 
 
 (b) referred or dismissed under subsection 44(2) or (3) or paragraph 45(2)(a) or 46(2)(a), or 
 
 
 
 (c) settled after receipt by the parties of the notice referred to in subsection 44(4), 
 
 
 
  	appoint a person, in this Part referred to as a 'conciliator', for the purpose of attempting to bring about a settlement of the complaint."
