The panel is entitled to prefer documentary evidence to a refugee claimant’s testimony. Mr. Justice Edmond P. Blanchard, in Meyer v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 F.C. 878, states at paragraph 20:
. . . The applicant essentially argued that the Board afforded far too much importance to the documentary evidence and failed to properly consider the applicant’s evidence. I reject the applicant’s argument. There is nothing before me to support the contention that the Board has failed to have regard to the evidence before it. The applicant may not accept the Board’s findings, but it is not the role of the Court on judicial review to re-weigh the evidence. It is also well established that the Board, an expert tribunal, is at liberty in assessing evidence to prefer documentary evidence over the testimony of an applicant. [Zhou v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1994] F.C.J. No. 1087 (QL)]. Based on the evidence before the Board, I do not find its credibility and plausibility assessments to be patently unreasonable.
