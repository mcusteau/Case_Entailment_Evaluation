I find some support for this view in the following passage from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass et al.
, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 391; 218 N.R. 81:
"56. Although the issue does not arise here, there is a great deal of force to the argument that s. 18(1) of the
Citizenship
Act
encompasses not only the ultimate decision as to whether citizenship was obtained by false pretences, but also those decisions made during the course of a s. 18 reference which are related to this determination. This would encompass all the interlocutory decisions which the court is empowered to make in the context of a s. 18 reference (see, for instance, s. 46 of the
Federal Court Act
and Rules 5, 450-455, 461, 477, 900-920, 1714 and 1715 of the
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C., c. 663)."
