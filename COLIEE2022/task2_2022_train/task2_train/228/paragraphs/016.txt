This brings me to the assertion, made by each party, that they enjoyed success on the reference before Justice MacKay and therefore should benefit from an award of costs against the other. Mr. Oberlander says that he was successful because he had to defend himself from an accusation of being a war criminal and was found by Justice MacKay not to be one. I do not agree. The extracts quoted earlier from Justice MacKay's decision are enough to show first, that there was no direct allegation of war crimes against which Mr. Oberlander had to defend himself, and second, that there was no evidence of such criminality. Mr. Oberlander's further submission that proceedings on the reference were rendered unnecessarily lengthy by allegations which the government could not prove is also without merit. Most of the allegations were in fact found proven by Justice MacKay and since Mr. Oberlander had put the government to the strict proof even of allegations which he could easily have admitted he cannot now complain that the trial was longer than it should have been.
