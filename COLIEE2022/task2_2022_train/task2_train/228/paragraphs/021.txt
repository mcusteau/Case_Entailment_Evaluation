These are legal fees paid and other expenses incurred by Mr. Oberlander for services rendered in the period from the issuance of Justice MacKay's decision down to and including the order of the Governor in Council to revoke citizenship based on that decision. They include such matters as the making of representations to the government as to why his personal situation and interests should militate against the revocation of his citizenship. No authority has been cited for a power for me to order the payment of such fees and I know of none. I would not allow anything under this head.
