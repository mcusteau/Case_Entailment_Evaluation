McGillis, J.
: The National Parole Board terminated the day parole of the applicant, a convicted sex offender, on the basis that he was being investigated as a suspect in the commission of other alleged sexual assaults. The Board conducted a review of the case and ordered the applicant detained in custody until the expiration of his sentence or until otherwise directed on the basis that there was a likelihood that, if released, he would "... commit an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person ...". The applicant has challenged this decision, arguing that the Board breached the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
or the rules of natural justice in its review of his case by failing to give timely disclosure of a psychiatric assessment, by failing to disclose a letter from a police force and by failing to provide a transcript of the detention review proceedings. The applicant has further argued that the Board infringed his right under s. 11(d) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
to be presumed innocent by considering in its review outstanding criminal charges involving a sexual assault alleged to have been committed by him in 1984.
