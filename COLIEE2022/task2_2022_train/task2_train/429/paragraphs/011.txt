The facts of this case establish that the psychiatric assessment in which the applicant had refused to participate was not disclosed to him at least 15 days before his detention review in compliance with s. 141(1) of the
Act
. However, a request that the psychiatric assessment be prepared "on an extremely urgent basis" was made at the earliest available opportunity on January 14, 1994, the date of the interim detention review hearing. The Board received this information, which consisted of a relatively brief, succinct and straightforward memorandum prepared by the psychiatrist, the day before the scheduled detention review hearing and immediately provided a copy of it to the legal assistant of the applicant. In the circumstances, I am of the opinion that the Board disclosed the information to the applicant "as soon as was practicable" within the meaning of s. 141(2) of the
Act
and thereby acted in accordance with the law.
