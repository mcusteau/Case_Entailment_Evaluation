The Board conducted an interim detention review hearing for the applicant on January 14, 1994 and determined that the information presented was sufficient to justify his interim detention. It scheduled a full detention review hearing for February 4, 1994 and requested a psychiatric assessment of the applicant. The case management officer of the applicant at the Kingston Penitentiary wrote to Psychiatric Services on the same date seeking to arrange a psychiatric assessment "on an extremely urgent basis". He stated in his memorandum that the hearing "must occur before February 12, 1994" and requested that the psychiatric assessment be completed before that date.
