With respect, the court disagrees with the applicant's argument that this is a flagrant breach of natural justice. As indicated by the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, the
Correctional and Conditional Release Regulations
and the Directives cited above, a detailed procedure exists for the redress of inmate complaints and grievances. This procedure offers adequate redress in the instant case, where there has not been any flagrant denial of natural justice. The applicant here has not exhausted the necessary alternative remedies. The instant application for judicial review is thus premature and inadmissible. The applicant should instead have taken his complaint through the inmate grievance procedure. For these reasons, the court need not consider the second issue, namely whether the Warden of the Donnacona Institution exceeded his jurisdiction by rendering a decision based on a mistaken finding of fact, without taking into account the evidence before him.
