While he was detained at Donnacona, the applicant made an application for day parole and full parole. On July 16, 1996 the National Parole Board (hereinafter "NPB") dismissed his application (Exhibit R-2). Among various reasons given for its refusal the NPB mentioned the fact that the applicant introduced contraband, including two pagers, to Leclerc. In its reasons the NPB also referred to a letter from the Leclerc Warden dated May 12, 1995, exempting (sic) the applicant from participation in the conspiracy to import a firearm. At the same time, the writer of the letter continued to believe that the applicant had brought in two pagers.
