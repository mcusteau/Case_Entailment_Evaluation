The decision to make a transfer of an inmate is a purely administrative one: see
Faulkner v. Canada (Solicitor General) et al.
(1992), 62 F.T.R. 19 (T.D.), at p. 24. The CSC must nonetheless observe the rules of procedural equity and natural justice in arriving at such a decision:
Camphaug v. Canada et al.
(1990), 34 F.T.R. 165 (T.D.) (hereinafter "
Camphaug
"). In spite of this the courts have many times taken the penitentiary situation into account and limited their intervention to cases of flagrant abuse:
Kelly v. Canada
(1987), 12 F.T.R. 296 (T.D.). Furthermore, the nature of the decision must be considered in the
internal
context of the prison. As Marceau, J.A., noted in
Gallant v. Correctional Services of Canada (Pacific Region)
, [1989] 3 F.C. 329; 92 N.R. 292 (F.C.A.), at p. 342: "It seems to me that, to appreciate the practical requirements of the 'audi alteram partem' principle, it is wrong to put on the same level all administrative decisions involving inmates in penitentiaries ..." Here the court is dealing with a
voluntary
transfer. The court notes that Directive No. 540 creates more procedural requirements in the case of an involuntary than a voluntary transfer. For example, ss. 13 and 14 of the Directive provide that "When an involuntary transfer is proposed ... the inmate shall be advised of his or her right to retain and instruct counsel". The Federal Court of Appeal has many times had occasion to consider the scope of reasons in an
involuntary
transfer of an inmate.
