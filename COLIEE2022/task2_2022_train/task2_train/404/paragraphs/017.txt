As a breach of natural justice and of the rules of fundamental justice protected by s. 7 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, the applicant submitted that the CSC is required to supply him with more information on the allegations of an escape conspiracy so he can present a complete defence. He alleged that the grounds for refusing the transfer, namely information to the effect that the applicant was involved in two escape conspiracies, was false and too ambiguous or vague to enable him to present a complete and intelligent defence. Accordingly, the next step for the court is to determine whether the respondent's decision was really vitiated by a denial of procedural equity. Were the reasons given for refusing to transfer the applicant so feeble that natural justice was infringed? Even if the court concludes that there was a breach of natural justice it could continue to regard the statutory remedy as adequate if that remedy could have corrected the injustice complained of by the applicant. There are thus two questions to be determined in the case at bar as to whether judicial review is admissible: (1) the existence of a breach of natural justice; and (2) if so, the remedial effect of the statutory remedy.
