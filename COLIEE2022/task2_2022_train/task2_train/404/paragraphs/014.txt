Further, ss. 4 and 19 of Commissioner's Directive No. 540, dealing with the transfer of inmates, state the following:
"Section 4.
"The head of the sending institution is authorized to approve voluntary intra-regional transfers to an institution of the same or reduced security level where agreement has been reached with the head of the proposed receiving institution. The head of the institution where an inmate is accommodated may deny requests for voluntary intra- and inter-regional transfers, without consulting the head of the proposed receiving institution, if in his/her opinion, the transfer should not occur, having due regard for the reasons for transfer as outlined in this directive.
"Section 19
REDRESS
"Inmates have the right to seek redress regarding transfer decisions using the inmate grievance procedure. Inmates grieving inter-regional transfer decisions shall have their grievances referred directly to the National Headquarters level,
except in those cases where the institutional head has denied a request for a voluntary transfer. In these cases, the grievance shall be forwarded to the Regional Headquarters level.
Inmates grieving intra-regional decisions shall have their grievances referred directly to the Regional Headquarters level except in those cases where the original decision was made by the Regional Deputy Commissioner. In such instances, the grievances shall be referred directly to the National Headquarters level. Inmates shall be advised of the applicable grievance procedure available, in writing, in the case of an unfavourable transfer decision, along with the reasons for the decision as described in paragraph 18."
