Natural justice, or the duty to act fairly, requires that inmates have the right to
know the gist of the allegations made
against them so they will be able to give a coherent response:
Demaria v. Regional Classification Board
, [1987] 1 F.C. 74; 69 N.R. 135 (F.C.A.) (hereinafter "
Demaria
"). In
Demaria
Hugessen, J.A., held at pp. 77-78:
"There is, of course, no doubt that the authorities were entitled to protect confidential sources of information. A penitentiary is not a choir school and, if informers were involved (the record here does not reveal whether they were or not), it is important that they not be put at risk. But even if that were the case it should always be possible to give the substance of the information while protecting the identity of the informant. The burden is always on the authorities to demonstrate that they have withheld only such information as is strictly necessary for that purpose ... In the final analysis, the test must be not whether there exist good grounds for withholding information but rather whether enough information has been revealed to allow the person concerned to answer the case against him."
