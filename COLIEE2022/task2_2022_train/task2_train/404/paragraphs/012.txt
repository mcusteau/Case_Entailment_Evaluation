As the respondent maintained in the case at bar, an inmate grievance procedure exists which the applicant could have used. The respondent's memorandum informed the applicant of his right to challenge the decision: [TRANSLATION] "Please note that C.D. 540, section 19, authorizes inmates to challenge a transfer decision using the inmate grievance procedure provided. Such a grievance will be referred to the Deputy Commissioner, Quebec Region." It is thus necessary to consider certain grievance procedure provisions to determine whether they provide an adequate remedy, especially in the case at bar where the applicant is alleging a breach of natural justice in the respondent's decision. Section 90 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
, S.C. 1992, s. 20 (hereinafter "the
Act
"), ss. 74 to 82 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations
, SOR/92-620 (hereinafter "the
Regulations
") and Commissioner's Directives Nos. 540 and 81 provide an inmate grievance procedure applicable here.
