[22]
In light of this affidavit, the court finds that the applicant was able to put forward a defence to the respondent's decision. He could have challenged the procedure and sources of information used by the respondent, as he did in the affidavit. The PSR dated August 14, 1995 supplied to the applicant referred very precisely to the PSR of January 31, 1995, which describes the conspiracy and suspicions against the applicant in detail. In view of the applicant's affidavit it is quite clear that the had access to these documents. Further, by referring to the PSR of January 31 the applicant could have challenged the notice of decision indicating that he was involved in two escape conspiracy cases instead of one.
