  In this case, the Judge determined that the Applicant had failed to demonstrate that he had resided in Canada for the required 1,095 days. In my view, this determination was reasonably open to the Judge. In her decision, the Judge listed a series of problems with the evidence (or lack of evidence) provided by the Applicant. Nothing was ignored. The evidence, as found by the Judge, was replete with inconsistencies and problems. Moreover, the Applicant's explanations of his absences became a moving target. On his application form, he declared 194 days of absence. On his residency questionnaire that became 33 days. An additional six undeclared absences were subsequently discovered. Based on the many problems with the evidence, it was not unreasonable for the Judge to conclude that the Applicant had not met his burden. Quite simply, the Judge was unable to establish  
 any 
  number of days of residence. In the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for the Judge to conclude that the Applicant had not met the requirement of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 . There is no reviewable error.
