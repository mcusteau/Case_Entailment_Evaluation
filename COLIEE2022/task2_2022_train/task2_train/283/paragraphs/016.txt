The panel relied on two more substantive reasons in finding that the Hezbollah document was fabricated:
I also prefer the foregoing documentary evidence, that members of Hizbollah do not conduct arrests of suspected Israeli collaborators, to the evidence of the claimant as it comes from independent sources with no interest in this refugee protection claim. In addition, I noted that the Police Clearance Certificate issued by the Lebanese Department of Internal Security Forces Judicial Police Headquarters in Beirut on September 23, 2000, referred to above, indicates that the claimant has never been charged with, or convicted of, any crime or offence in Lebanon. I find it implausible that, had Hizbollah called for his arrest by Lebanese security forces; the Judicial Police in Beirut would have not issued such a Police Clearance Certificate. [unedited]
While the Police Clearance Certificate refers only to the absence of convictions, the applicant described the document as one "... stating that I have no charges against me in Lebanon."
