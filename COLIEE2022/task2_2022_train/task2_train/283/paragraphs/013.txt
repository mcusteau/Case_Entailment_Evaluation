Counsel for the applicant argued that it was irrational for the decision-maker to expect the applicant to obtain an original copy of the arrest warrant from Hezbollah, the agent of persecution. In my view, this argument has no merit. According to the applicant's personal information form, the document in question is a letter obtained by his friend Ali Hattoum. If the applicant had chosen to do so, it would have been a simple matter to obtain the original letter from Mr. Hattoum. Also, production of the original would have been consistent with Rule 36 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR/2002-228. In his closing submissions at the refugee hearing, the applicant's counsel himself acknowledged "... all we have is a fax of that document." In my opinion, the panel's interest in the original of the Hezbollah letter was neither unreasonable nor capricious.
