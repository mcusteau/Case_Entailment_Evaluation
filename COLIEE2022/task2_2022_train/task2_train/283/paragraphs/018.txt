Upon my review of the transcript of the refugee hearing and the relevant documentary evidence, I am satisfied that the panel's error concerning the filing date of the Hezbollah document is neither central nor material to its reasons for decision and its negative determination: Rohm & Haas Co. of Canada v. Canada (Anti Dumping Tribunal), [1978] F.C.J. No. 522 (QL) (C.A.), at paragraph 9; Owusu v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1988] F.C.J. No. 434 (QL) (C.A.); Miranda v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 437 (QL) (T.D.); and Stelco Inc. v. British Steel Canada Inc., [2000] 3 F.C. 282, at paragraph 22. The decision in Owusu Ansah v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] F.C.J. No. 442 (QL) (C.A.), relied upon by the applicant, can easily be distinguished on the facts in this proceeding.
