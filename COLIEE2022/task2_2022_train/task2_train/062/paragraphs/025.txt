 [25] 
  This application raises several issues, including: the role of the RAD on appeal and the standard of review it should apply to a decision of the RPD; whether the RAD breached a duty of procedural fairness to the applicant by reviewing findings of credibility without providing the applicant an opportunity to address those findings and without holding an oral hearing; whether the RAD erred in rejecting new evidence; and, whether the RAD's approach to this appeal could be perceived as demonstrating a reasonable apprehension of bias.
