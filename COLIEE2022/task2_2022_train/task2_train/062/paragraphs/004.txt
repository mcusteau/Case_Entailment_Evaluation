 [4] 
  This application for judicial review is allowed with respect to the section 97 claim only. The RAD erred in applying judicial review principles and the reasonableness standard of review to the appeal of the RPD decision and failed to observe principles of procedural fairness by reviewing positive credibility findings of the RPD without providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond to the RAD's concerns about the RPD's credibility findings. Other aspects of the RAD decision are also problematic and arise from the RAD's approach to its appellate role.
