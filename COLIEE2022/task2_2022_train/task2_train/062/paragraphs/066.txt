  In  
 R v Mian 
 , 2014 SCC 54, [2014] 2 SCR 689 [ 
 Mian 
 ], the Supreme Court of Canada addressed the scope of an appellate court's jurisdiction to raise new issues, what constitutes a new issue, when such jurisdiction should be exercised and the procedures to be followed. Although  
 Mian 
  was a criminal case, the principles have been applied in other proceedings, including the administrative context.
