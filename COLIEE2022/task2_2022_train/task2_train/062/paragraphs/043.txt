 Huruglica v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 799 at paras 25-34, [2014] FCJ No 845, Justice Phelan provided a comprehensive analysis leading to the conclusion that this Court should review the RAD's choice of standard of review on the correctness standard. Other decisions followed the same approach including
