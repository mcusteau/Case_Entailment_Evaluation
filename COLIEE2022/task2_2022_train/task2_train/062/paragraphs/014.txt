  The RAD considered the applicant's request to submit five articles as new evidence. The RAD referred to each article and found that the articles were not relevant or material to the facts that underpin the claim. The RAD noted with respect to subsection 110(4) and Rule 3(3)(g)(iii) of the  
 Refugee Appeal Division Rules 
 , SOR/2012-257 [RAD Rules] that the applicant had provided a blanket statement that the documents met the requirements of the Act but did not indicate how, as directed by the Rule. The RAD also found the evidence was not admissible because it did "not pass the requirements of  
 Raza" 
  (this refers to  
 Raza v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FCA 385, [2007] FCJ No 1632 [ 
 Raza 
 ]).
