  On the appeal, the applicant argued: 
 
 
 
 • The RPD erred in finding that he had not rebutted the presumption of state protection; 
 
 
 
 • The RPD erred in not fully assessing his personalized risk pursuant to section 97; and, 
 
 
 
 • That new evidence should be accepted in accordance with subsection 110(4) of the Act to establish an objective basis for his fear of dying in the National Service.
