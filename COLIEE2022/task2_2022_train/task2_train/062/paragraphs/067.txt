 [67] 
  The Court defined a "new issue" at para 30: 
 
 
 
 An issue is new when it raises a new basis for potentially finding error in the decision under appeal beyond the grounds of appeal as framed by the parties. Genuinely new issues are legally and factually distinct from the grounds of appeal raised by the parties (see  
 Quan v. Cusson 
 , 2009 SCC 62, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 712, at para. 39) and cannot reasonably be said to stem from the issues as framed by the parties.  
 It follows from this definition that a new issue will require notifying the parties in advance so that they are able to address it adequately 
 . [Emphasis added]
