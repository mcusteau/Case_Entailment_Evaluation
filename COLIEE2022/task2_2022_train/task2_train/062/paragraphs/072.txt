  In conducting a full fact based appeal, the RAD would not be precluded from considering new issues not raised on the appeal. In the present case, the applicant raised three issues. The RAD indicated it would focus on four issues, but only one was related to one of the issues raised by the applicant regarding his fear of National Service. If the principles in  
 Mian 
  are adapted and applied to appeals conducted by the RAD, at minimum, the RAD should have considered whether the credibility findings were new issues and whether it was essential to address these findings to avoid an injustice. If so, the applicant should have had an opportunity to make submissions on the issue.
