On April 8, 2000, Caldwell band members were scheduled to vote on whether to ratify the terms of the proposed Settlement. The government had agreed to pay $23,400,000 in settlement of the Caldwells' claims relating to their eviction from their lands without a proper surrender. The Settlement was characterized by the Band Council as the single most important event in the history of the Caldwells. The Claimants, however, had serious concerns regarding the propriety of the actions of the Band Council with respect to the negotiation of the Settlement, and the manner in which the ratification vote was being conducted. They therefore brought an application for judicial review in T-850-99 and moved for an interim and interlocutory injunction restraining the Band Councillors and Chief from conducting the ratification vote.
