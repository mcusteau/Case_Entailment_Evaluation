Although I agree with the Band Council that the Claimants at times overreached their case by making broad and unfocussed allegations, I am not satisfied that their complaints about the membership list and ratification process were wholly without merit. Granted, the Claimants could have run their litigation in more efficient and effective manner. In addition, their claim did contain numerous personal allegations against members of the Caldwell First Nation Band council. However, the focus of their claim was on the electoral process, the accountability of the Band Council, and the propriety and the manner in which the Settlement had been negotiated.
