In fact, from the Claimantsâ€™ perspective, success, if any, was theirs. They ultimately succeeded in delaying the settlement ratification vote by four years, by which time the Band membership had been sufficiently apprised of all the issues underlying the vote; and that they were able to influence changes to the Band electoral process through the CEC. As eloquently stated by Lonnie Dodge, one of the Plaintiffs in T-850-99 and the Applicant in T-1702-2, in his affidavit filed in response to the motion, at paragraphs 42, 45:
Since the commencement of our action, the settlement agreement which was a significant part of our actions, was voted down; Chief Larry Johnson has been found in contempt of court, an election process has been used with regards to the settlement agreement vote, whereby a membership list was made available to us prior to the election, a third party without conflict oversaw the settlement agreement votes, the efforts of the Chief to locate the Band in the Chatham-Kent area has been turned down by the Band and at least we have some semblance of an election code being put forward for the Band to vote on.

If anyone is entitled to costs, it would be us and in the interest of creating harmony in the Band and trying to bring matters back together, we believe that no costs should be awarded in this case, and we should move forward with the development of the election code and with a fair and proper election for Chief and council. We believe that should take place as soon as possible. We signed the agreement in principle and in good faith, on the understanding that the next election will be open, transparent and fair and will occur soon after the Band approves a new code.
