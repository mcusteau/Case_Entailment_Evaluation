The Settlement ratification vote took place on August 8, 2003 and was defeated. On the basis of this vote, the Claimants withdrew the bulk of their allegations at a pre-trial conference held January 14, 2004. The remaining allegations were settled at a mediation conducted with the parties on November 19, 2004. The Minutes of Settlement provided, among other things, that a custom election code (“CEC”) for the Caldwell First Nation would be drafted and presented to the membership on or before June 30, 2005, and that ratification of the CEC would be sought by December 31, 2005. The parties were unable to agree on the issue of costs, however, and therefore expressly reserved the right to bring a motion for costs.
