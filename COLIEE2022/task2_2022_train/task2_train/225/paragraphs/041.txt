  The tribunal rejected the applicant's testimony why he had not fled Bangladesh before the August, 2004 attack. The applicant had explained it was because during this incident the BNP Goons threatened to kill him. The tribunal stated "this explanation is hardly reasonable since, according to his story he was attacked several times before, threatened and injured. He was also detained in April 2004. The claimant explained that the previous incidents were not serious enough for him to stop his political activities".
