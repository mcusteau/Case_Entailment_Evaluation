  The tribunal mentioned the applicant was asked why was it he decided to stop his political activities and go into hiding on August 25, 2004 and not before. According to the tribunal, the applicant explained it was because during this incident for the first time Monir Hajee and the BNP goons threatened to kill him. The tribunal concluded "this explanation is hardly reasonable since, according to his story he was attacked several times before, threatened and injured. He was also detained in April 2004. The claimant explained the previous incidents were not serious enough for him to stop his political activities. This explanation makes little sense".
