  The tribunal described another facet of the applicant's testimony regarding his arrest in April, 2004. The applicant was asked if before August 27, 2004 he had any problems with the authorities. At first the applicant answered he never had any problem with the police. The tribunal noted "it is only after the Presiding Member repeated the question that the claimant realised he was in trouble. He modified his testimony and justified his previous answer by explaining that before August 27, 2004 he had been arrested by the police, but they had not come to his house. For the above reasons, the tribunal concludes that the claimant was not arrested by the police, contrary to his allegations".
