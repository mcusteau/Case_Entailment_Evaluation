  The overall impression I have of the tribunal's decision is that it was impermissibly overzealous in seeking to find the applicant not credible leading it to fail to consider the substance of his claim which was his fear of returning to Bangladesh because of the death threat he had received from political opponents of the Awami League in his district which is headed by an elected representative of the BNP who was also apparently a Cabinet Minister and was supported in his endeavours by his close associate Monir Hajee with the collaboration of the police who were looking for him.
