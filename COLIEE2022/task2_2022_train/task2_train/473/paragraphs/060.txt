I do not think that the presumption in s. 21(3) requires the Court to prefer Mr. Lunn's subjective beliefs regarding the quality of the testing over the evidence in the medical records. It requires only that the Court believe his assertions of significant back and hearing injuries (since no lack of credibility was found), provided his assertions are uncontradicted. However, these assertions are contradicted by both the in-service audiograms and the audiogram conducted at the time of his release from the military, both of which said that his back and hearing were "normal."
