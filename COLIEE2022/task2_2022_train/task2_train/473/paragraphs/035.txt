Although the Applicant consulted a military doctor about the running and snow-shovelling incident in 1991 when he was stationed in Cold Lake, Alberta, the Applicant observes that there is "next to no information" on his medical file regarding his back injury. It appears that, around the time of this incident, the Applicant was facing a court martial. The Applicant seems to suggest that, given those circumstances, the military focused "first and foremost" on the Applicant's psychiatric condition at the expense of maintaining a complete record of his physical condition.
