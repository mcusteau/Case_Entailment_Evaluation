This finding was supported by evidence which showed that:
a. The Applicant did not report the 1990 injury;
b. He did complain in 1991 when he re-injured his back shovelling snow, but this injury was resolved with treatment;
c. The Applicant made no further complaints regarding his back until he made his pension claim in 2008 and his 1994 Medical Examination for Release from the Canadian Forces indicates that his spine was considered "normal."
