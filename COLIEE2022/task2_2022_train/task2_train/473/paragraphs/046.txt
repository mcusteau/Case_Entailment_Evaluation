[46]
The Respondent acknowledges that the Applicant suffers from degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine. However, for reasons similar to those canvassed above, the Applicant is not entitled to a disability pension. The Applicant failed to meet the two conditions under subsection 21(2)(a) of the
Pension Act
discussed above. In the absence of sufficient evidence which proves on a balance of probabilities that there is a causal connection between the Applicant's degenerative disc disease and his military service, the Board acted reasonably in finding that the Applicant's pension claim should be denied.
