  On January 8, 2002, Ms. Lusina contacted the CHRC and advised that her lawyer was satisfied with Bell's final offer and had recommended that she withdraw her complaint before it was mailed to Bell. She again spoke with Ms. Harrington and Ms. Lusina's file was pulled. Ms. Harrington informed Ms. Lusina that she (Ms. Harrington) did not know whether withdrawal of the complaint required the approval of the CHRC and that she would have to speak with her manager. Ms. Lusina told Ms. Harrington that her lawyer wanted the settlement offer accepted "today" and that he believed that service of a human rights complaint might affect the settlement. Ms. Lusina preferred to have more time to think about it. Ms. Harrington advised that she (Ms. Harrington) would keep the file with her until Ms. Lusina made a decision, that Ms. Lusina had one year from the date of the alleged conduct within which to file a complaint and, that if and when she decided to pursue it, the complaint could be amended to explain the settlement and the reasons for pursuing the human rights aspect. In the meantime, Ms. Harrington would make the inquiry regarding whether CHRC approval was required to close the file.
