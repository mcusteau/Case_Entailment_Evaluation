  It is common ground that the termination was without cause. Bell maintains that Ms. Lusina's position had been eliminated. Ms. Lusina claims that it was due to discrimination based on age and a perceived disability -health as a result of a previous heart attack -in contravention of sections 7 and 10 of the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6 ( 
 CHRA 
 ). By correspondence dated December 15, 2003, Ms. Lusina and Bell were informed that, on December 1, 2003, the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC) dismissed Ms. Lusina's complaint of discrimination. Ms. Lusina seeks judicial review and asks that I quash the decision and order the CHRC to investigate her complaint.
