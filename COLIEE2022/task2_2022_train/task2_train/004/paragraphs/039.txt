  The record, on this application, discloses further communications between the investigator and Bell. The content of those communications has been reviewed earlier in these reasons. There is no indication of further communication between the investigator and Ms. Lusina. To state the obvious, the investigator's report, which was based solely on the grounds enumerated in paragraph 41(1)(d) of the  
 CHRA 
 , was completed without the benefit of Ms. Lusina's position on that issue. To overstate the obvious, that is, in my view, an omission of a fundamental nature.
