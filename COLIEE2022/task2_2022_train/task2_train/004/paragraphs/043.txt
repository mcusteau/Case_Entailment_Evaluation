  I conclude that Ms. Lusina's opportunity to respond was compromised at both levels - the investigation level and the CHRC level. This constitutes a breach of procedural fairness that vitiates the decision. As a result, the application for judicial review will be allowed and the matter will be remitted to the Canadian Human Rights Commission for redetermination. An order will so provide. I emphasize that my conclusion is confined to the unique circumstances of this matter. It is not my intent to usurp the function of the CHRC to determine which complaints it will accept. It is not, in my opinion, open to me to order the CHRC to do anything other than redetermine the matter. This decision is founded upon the concept of procedural fairness in the process in relation to this particular complaint.
