  By correspondence dated January 11th, the CHRC informed Bell of the complaint. There is conflicting evidence as to whether Bell received this correspondence on January 17th or 18th, but it was not later than January 18th, the day that it executed the agreement. By correspondence to Ms. Lusina, dated February 28th, Bell insisted that the human rights complaint be withdrawn and advised that processing of the settlement package would be finalized upon receipt of confirmation in this respect. The manager of alternative dispute resolution at the CHRC subsequently attempted to mediate the humans rights issues. On April 23rd, Bell, without prejudice to its position in relation to the human rights complaint, paid Ms. Lusina her salary for the months of April through December, 2001. The mediation, held in June, 2002, was unsuccessful.
