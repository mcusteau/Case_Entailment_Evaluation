  On November 20th, Ms. Lusina responded to the investigator's summary of Bell's position. She attached various supporting documents and included a list of suggested witnesses. She amended her witness list in a further letter dated April 16, 2003. Bell, on December 6th, provided its response to the October 30th questions of the CHRC. Although it is not clear at what point the CHRC subsequently asked Bell for further documents, it is evident from Bell's correspondence dated February 27, 2003, that it responded to a further request for additional documentation associated with Ms. Lusina's complaint.
