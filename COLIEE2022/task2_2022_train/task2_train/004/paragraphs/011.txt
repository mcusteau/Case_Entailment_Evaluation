  Also on October 30th, the investigator requested that Bell respond to additional questions concerning Bell's separation program and, specifically, the non-voluntary phase. The investigator explained that because of the allegation that Bell had discriminated in contravention of section 10 of the  
 CHRA 
 , a thorough analysis of its policy was required. To that end, the investigator requested a "full and complete response to each of the following questions": 
 
 
 
 "1. What is the purpose of the Voluntary Separation Program? What is the objective requirement(s) of the position of Call Centre Manager? Please explain whether there is a rational connection between the purpose of the VSP and the objective requirements of the job. 
 
 
 
 "2. Was the adoption of the VSP done with an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the accomplishment of its purpose? Please explain. 
 
 
 
 "3. Is the VSP policy reasonably necessary for Bell Canada to accomplish its purpose? Specifically, what other alternatives were explored when the complainant's position was eliminated? Could she have been offered another position elsewhere with the company? Why was this option not explored? Was forcing the complainant into an involuntary retirement the least discriminatory means of addressing the situation? Please fully explain."
