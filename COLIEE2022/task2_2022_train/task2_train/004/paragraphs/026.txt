  The role and function of the CHRC is to accept, manage and process complaints of discriminatory practices. It is an administrative and screening body with no appreciable adjudicative role. Its function is not to decide if a complaint is made out but to determine if, under the provisions of the  
 CHRA 
 , an inquiry is warranted having regard to all of the facts:
