  The decision of the CHRC does not refer to paragraph 41(1)(d) of the  
 CHRA 
 . However, the investigator's report recommends "pursuant to paragraph 41(1)(d) of the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , that the Commission not deal with the complaint". Although the parties did not address the issue, it appears to me that subparagraph 44(3)(b)(ii) is the operative provision. Once the CHRC designates an investigator to investigate a complaint, it is the role of the investigator to create a record for the CHRC, based on which - along with the responses of the parties - the CHRC will decide either to dismiss the complaint or to ask the tribunal to institute an inquiry into the complaint. Subparagraph 44(3)(b)(ii) mandates that the CHRC shall dismiss a complaint to which the (investigator's) report relates if it is satisfied that the complaint should be dismissed on any grounds mentioned in paragraphs 41(c) to (e).
