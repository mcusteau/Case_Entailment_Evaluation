Counsel for the applicants argues that the Board's decision is in error on four grounds. First, the Board applied the wrong burden of proof when assessing the reasonableness of an internal flight alternative ("IFA") to Colombo. Second, the Board exhibited prejudgment of the applicant's case because the presiding member expressed the opinion, before the end of the applicant's evidence, that he could not imagine anyone perceiving her to be a LTTE supporter and that her fears, concerning what might happen to her if she went back to Sri Lanka, appeared to be "frankly, outrageous". Third, the Board relied on the applicant's circumstances and particularly her age (41) when assessing the likelihood of persecution without also taking account of the situation of her two children. Fourth, the Board made reference to factors, from which it concluded that Colombo was a reasonable IFA, for which there is no support on the record.
