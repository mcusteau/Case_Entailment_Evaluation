Reed, J.
: The applicants seek an order quashing a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Board"). The applicants are mother and daughter. Only the mother appeared at the hearing and when the word applicant is used in the singular in these reasons it refers to her. The Board's decision found the applicants not to be Convention refugees.
