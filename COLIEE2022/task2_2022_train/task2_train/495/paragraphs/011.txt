In addition to assessing whether or not there is a serious possibility of persecution in a location which has been identified as a possible IFA, a decision maker must also determine whether it is reasonable to expect the applicants to take refuge there. In this regard, while the Board referred to the factors identified in the UNHCR letter (with which we are now all familiar), it dismissed the fact that not one of those factors existed in the applicant's case. That letter cautions governments against sending individuals back to Sri Lanka on the ground that there is a valid IFA to some parts of the country, including Colombo. The letter indicates that a reasonable IFA may exist when an individual has had a history of residence in the relevant area, or has close relatives in the area or has a history of past employment in the area. The Board indicated that the factors, identified by the UNHCR, were preferences and not requirements. The Board went on to state that Colombo was a reasonable alternative for the applicant, despite the fact that none of the three circumstances, identified by the UNHCR, existed in her case. The Board found Colombo to be a reasonable alternative because of the applicant's age, social status and the financial support from relatives who lived elsewhere.
