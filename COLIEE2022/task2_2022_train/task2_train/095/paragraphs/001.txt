 Layden-Stevenson, J. 
 : The applicant, North of Smokey Fishermen's Association (NOSFA), is an incorporated society that represents the interests of its fish harvester members in Nova Scotia. On December 27, 2002, NOSFA commenced an application for judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Fisheries and Oceans to approve a 4Vn winter cod fishery. NOSFA asks that the decision be quashed and that the Minister be prohibited from making a decision to open a 4Vn winter fishery on the basis that such decision exceeds the Minister's authority and/or constitutes an abuse of the Minister's discretion.
