  The concern with respect to the long-term future viability of fish stocks in Atlantic Canada, while real, is, on the basis of the evidence before me, speculative and based on opinion. Moreover, there is no allegation of harm to the applicant directly. The situation is not dissimilar to that in  
 Esquimalt 
  wherein the second element of the test was not satisfied because the association had not established irreparable harm as far as the (applicant) was concerned.  
 RJR-MacDonald 
  also cautions that it is the applicant's  
 own 
  interests that must be adversely affected. There is no evidence as to how NOSFA will be directly affected if the relief is not granted. Further, and despite the expressed concerns, neither is there evidence that a permanent loss of natural resources will be the result if the challenged activity is not enjoined. NOSFA has not met the onus of establishing that irreparable harm will result.
