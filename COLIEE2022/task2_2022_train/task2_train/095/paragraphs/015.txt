  The applicant here, as in  
 Glenview Corp. 
 , has not presented, in evidence or argument, any serious challenge to the legal capacity of the Minister or his officials to open the 4Vn cod winter fishery. Accordingly, the application for an interlocutory injunction must fail on this basis. Alternatively, the elements of the test for the granting of an interlocutory injunction have not been met in any event.
