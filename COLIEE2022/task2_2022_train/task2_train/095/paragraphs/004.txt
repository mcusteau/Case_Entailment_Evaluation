  The Minister announced the Gulf of Saint Lawrence Groundfish Management Plan (the Plan) on June 17, 2002. The Plan set the total allowable catch for the southern Gulf cod stock at 6,000 tonnes. This stock spends part of the year (May to October) in the NAFO 4T area and the remainder of the year in the 4Vn area. The stock is identified in the Plan as the 4TVn (November to April) cod stock. The applicant was advised of the Plan by correspondence from the Regional Director dated December 3, 2002. The fishing season for this stock extends from June 1, 2002 to May 31, 2003. The Plan specifies that at least 83.3% of the total allowable catch must be caught while the stock is in the 4T area. The remaining amount, up to 16.7% (860 tonnes this year) can be taken while the stock is in the 4Vn area, during the overwintering period from November to April. The 4Vn portion of the fishery has been traditionally allocated to the inshore (less than 65 feet) Scotia Fundy fleets and Atlantic wide offshore companies. Activity reported under the approved plan for the 2002-2003 fishery as of January 2, 2003 indicates that 5,127 tonnes of the 6,000 tonnes total allowable catch has been caught in 4T, primarily by inshore fleets. Some of the catch was made by Scotia Fundy fleets that opted to fish their 4Vn share of the quota in 4T. As a result, 452 tonnes of quota remain to be fished in the 4Vn area this winter.
