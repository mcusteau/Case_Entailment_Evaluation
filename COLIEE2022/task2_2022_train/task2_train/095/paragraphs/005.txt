  In 1993, the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council (FRCC) was created to form a partnership between scientific and academic expertise and all sectors of the fishing industry. The FRCC makes public recommendations on matters such as allowable catch rates and conservation measures. When the fishery re-opened in 1999, on the recommendation of the FRCC, no fishing was authorized in the 4Vn area during the winter period because of concerns over the resident 4Vn cod stock. The FRCC advised that "fishing on the 4TVn cod during its over-wintering in 4Vn (November - April) should only take place to the extent that there is high confidence that catch for 4Vn (resident) cod be minimal".
