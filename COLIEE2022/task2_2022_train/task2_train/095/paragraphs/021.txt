  Regarding irreparable harm, the applicant argues that it is the nature or quality, as opposed to the quantity, of the harm that is of concern. NOSFA maintains that not only can the harm not be compensated by way of damages, but it is substantial. The difficulty, it contends, is that as yet, it is unknown whether the stock is above, near to or below a critical biomass level. Additionally, other Scotian shelf cod stocks and other species, specifically white hake, could be negatively impacted by this fishery. If any of these stocks are at levels where their recovery is in doubt, the winter 4Vn cod fishery could push them beyond the point where recovery is possible.
