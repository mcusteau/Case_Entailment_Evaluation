  The Minister approved a 2003 winter opening in the 4Vn area for the balance of the 4TVn quotas assigned (452 tonnes) subject to conservation harvesting plans with stringent monitoring controls. The conservation harvesting plans establish fishing area restrictions and require mandatory dockside monitoring as well as third-party observer coverage at sea at all times. The 4Vn is open to direct for cod from December 15, 2002 to March 31, 2003. The 2003 scientific reviews of the status of the cod stocks in the Gulf (containing data on the minimal biomass level of the resident stocks in 4Vn) are due to be released by the end of March, 2003.
