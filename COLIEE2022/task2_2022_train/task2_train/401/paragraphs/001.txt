Stinson, J.
: This action, asserting misconduct by the Defendant associated with challenges to certain income tax assessments, was struck out with costs for disclosing no cause of action. I issued a timetable for written disposition of the assessment of the Defendant's bill of costs. The Plaintiff's materials took the form of a complaint against the Court, alleging malicious prosecution, for submission to Parliament. They included a statement of opposition to the bill of costs.
