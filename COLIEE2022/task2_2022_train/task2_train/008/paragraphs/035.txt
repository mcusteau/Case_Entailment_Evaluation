 [35] 
  The notion that rape can be merely motivated by common criminal intent or desire, without regard to gender or the status of females in a society is wrong according to Canadian law (see also  
 R. v. Lavallee 
 , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852; 108 N.R. 321; 67 Man.R.(2d) 1). In addition, rape is referred to as a "gender-specific" crime in the Gender Guidelines.
