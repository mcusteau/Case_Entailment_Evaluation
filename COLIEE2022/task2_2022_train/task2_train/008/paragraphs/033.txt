  There was evidence before the Board that contradicted its finding that risk of rape is generalized: 
 
 
 
 - In "U.S. Department of State: 2008 Human Rights Report: Haiti" the authors suggest that Haitian women are specifically targeted for rape and this is violence that exists in the context of pervasive discrimination against women (sexual harassment, domestic violence, indifference by the judiciary and the police to the violence which is directed to them). This document discusses the ineffectiveness of the legal prohibition of rape. 
 
 
 
 - An update provided by the "Amnesty International Report 2007: Haiti" identified the risk of rape as specific to women: "women and girls continued to be tortured, raped and killed by illegal armed groups and individuals". 
 
 
 
 - A news report authored by Andrew Buncombe, "Police and political groups linked to Haiti sex attacks", September 2006, reports on a survey of sexual violence published by the Lancet. It correlates the existence of civil unrest in the two years following Aristide's forced exile from Haiti with high incidence of rape. Between February 2004 and December 2005, 35,000 women were sexually assaulted in Haiti's capital and 90% of those assaults were rape: 
 
 
 
 "both the report's authors and other human rights workers said they believe the level of rape is directly linked to a high level of general violence and lawlessness - conditions that existed in abundance during the interim government period." 
 
 
 
 This evidence supports a finding that women are targeted for rape in the capital city and the event of political instability coincided with a heightened risk of rape. This information does not undermine a finding that rape is a gender-related crime. It can be interpreted as supporting the assertion that rape is a weapon used to gain social control. 
 
 
 
 - In an update from Doctors Without Borders, "Treating Sexual Violence in Haiti: Doctors Without Borders", October 30, 2007, it is clear that the incidence of rape remains high, although self-reporting rates to either hospitals or the police is low. Specialized medical facilities are required to deal with the trauma of rape.
