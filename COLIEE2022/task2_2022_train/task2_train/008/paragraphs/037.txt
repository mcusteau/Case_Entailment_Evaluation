  In July 1994, Human Rights Watch, National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, produced a report documenting harrowing stories of rape and the purpose of rape. This document explicitly connects the violence of rape to oppression of women in Haiti's recent history: 
 
 
 
 "... Like men, women have been killed, arrested for their actual or imputed political views, beaten while in detention, forced into internal hiding (called  
 marronage 
 ), disappeared, and denied the most basic civil and political rights to political expression, humane treatment and due process. 
 
 
 
 " 
 Reports from women's rights groups in Haiti reveal that women also are targeted for abuse in ways and for reasons that men are not 
 . Uniformed military personnel and their civilian allies have threatened and attacked women's organizations for their work in defense of women's rights and have subjected women to sex-specific abuse ranging from bludgeoning women's breasts to rape. Rape also is a part of apparently random violence committed by bands of zenglendos.  
 Social unrest, which is both fostered and exploited by the military authorities in order to repress opposition to their rule, has contributed to increased levels of seemingly random violence
