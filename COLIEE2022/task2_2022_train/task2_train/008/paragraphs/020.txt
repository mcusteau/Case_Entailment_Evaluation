  In  
 Bastien 
 , supra, the Court overturned a decision of the Board because the member failed to consider the applicant's claim in light of her membership in a particular group, namely, "her status as a Haitian woman and as an individual returning to Haiti from abroad". The Board had ended the inquiry after determining that the applicant's allegation of past persecution was not credible. The Court analyzed the Board's reasons as follows: 
 
 
 
 "[11] Given that there is no dispute about the fact that Ms. Bastien is indeed a Haitian woman, or that she would in fact be returning from abroad if she went back to Haiti, the question for the Board at this juncture in its analysis was not whether her story of past persecution was credible. 
 
 
 
 "[12] Rather, the questions that the Board ought to have addressed in relation to this aspect of Ms. Bastien's claim included determining whether there was documentary or other evidence before it as to the generalized persecution of women in Haiti. In addition, the Board ought to have considered whether women in Haiti generally, as well as those returning to Haiti from abroad, constituted particular social groups."
