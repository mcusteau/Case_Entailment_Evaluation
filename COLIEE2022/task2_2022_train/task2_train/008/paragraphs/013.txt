  This affidavit was not before the Board. I agree with the respondent that it should, therefore, not be considered by this Court. This is in keeping with the Court's role as a court of review and not a forum for a de novo appeal. The scope of evidence on an application for judicial review is restricted to the material that was before the decision-maker ( 
 Lemiecha et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1993), 72 F.T.R. 49 (T.D.) at 51; see also,  
 Walker v. Randall et al. 
  (1999), 173 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.)). Additional evidence may be submitted on issues of procedural fairness and jurisdiction according to  
 Ontario Association of Architects v. Association of Architectural Technologists of Ontario 
 , [2003] 1 F.C. 331; 291 N.R. 61; 2002 FCA 218, leave to appeal refused (2003), 313 N.R. 195 (S.C.C.).
