  The issue in the case at bar is not whether the Board was reasonable in determining that the applicant is not a member of a particular social group; in fact, as I read the decision, the Board seems to have accepted that the applicant was a member of a social group. Rather, the question in the case at bar is whether the Board's finding that the applicant faced a risk of general criminality such that there is no nexus between her risk and her social group is defensible in law or in fact. It is also noteworthy that the Board considered the documentary evidence and did not rely on its credibility finding as in the case cited by the applicant. In light of the foregoing therefore, neither of the cases cited by the parties is directly on point.
