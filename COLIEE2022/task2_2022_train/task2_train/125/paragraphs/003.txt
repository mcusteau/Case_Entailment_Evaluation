  For some years Treasury Board had in place policies designed to avoid departments using a succession of term appointments to avoid the permanent employment of staff whose need was demonstrably required on a continuing basis. The policy in operation when the applicant was first employed was the Long Term Specified Period Employment Policy, 1999, made effective on June 10 of that year. It directed departments, in respect of employees who had worked under term appointments for a cumulative working period of at least five years without a break in service longer than sixty days, to appoint such employees to indeterminate appointments. It also required that where any term appointee was not to be renewed he or she should be given "formal notification" of that fact, the period of notice varying with the number of years he or she had been employed already. In the case of those employed from three to five years they were to be given a notice of at least five weeks. It will be noted in the present case that the applicant, who had served over three years, was given written notice of only one month that his term appointment would not be renewed, such notice being four days less than the five weeks required for "formal notification".
