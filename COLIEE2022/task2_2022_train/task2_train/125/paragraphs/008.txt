  By virtue of s. 96(3) of the  
 Public Service Staff Relations Act 
  it is provided that, in a grievance under s. 91, 
 
 
 
 "... the decision on the grievance taken at the final level in the grievance process is final and binding for all purposes of this Act and no further action under this Act may be taken thereon." 
 
 
 
                                                                                                      
 
 
 
 "... la décision rendue au dernier palier de la procédure applicable en la matière est finale et obligatoire, et aucune autre mesure ne peut être prise sous le régime de la présente loi à l'égard du grief ainsi tranché." 
 
 
 
 It appears to me, however, that this does not preclude judicial review under the  
 Federal Court Act 
 . In  
 Vaughan v. Canada 
 , [2003] F.C.J. No. 241; 306 N.R. 366 (F.C.A.) (appeal heard in the Supreme Court of Canada May 17, 2004, rehearing there ordered October 5, 2004) it was held that s. 91 provides a complete regime for disposing of matters coming within that section and a claim that may be asserted through a grievance under s. 91 cannot be entertained as a cause of action in this Court. In that case all three judges of the Federal Court of Appeal agreed in obiter that this did not oust the supervisory jurisdiction of the Federal Court over a s. 91 decision on judicial review. Evans, J.A., in a separate set of reasons said that the Court could be asked to review "the fairness of the administrative process, the rationality of material findings of fact, and the lawfulness of the decision or action in question." (Para. 136). I respectfully adopt that as the description of the scope of review in such a matter.
