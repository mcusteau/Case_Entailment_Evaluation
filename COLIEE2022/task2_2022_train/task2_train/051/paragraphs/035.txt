  It follows that, having subjected the Director's decision to a somewhat probing examination, I conclude that he: 
 
 
 
 1. placed reliance on the failure to formally wind up or dissolve PGL when this is not a requirement of the legislation; 
 
 
 
 2. drew an inference adverse to the taxpayer from the payment of filing fees and the filing of annual returns when the failure to do so would not have led to the dissolution of the corporation; 
 
 
 
 3. failed to consider as of December 31, 1993 whether, after the resolution of the contemplated lawsuit, it was reasonable to expect that PGL would be dissolved or wound up and that it would not carry on business; 
 
 
 
 4. for an irrelevant reason gave no weight to the fact that the consulting business was transferred out of PGL; and 
 
 
 
 5. placed reliance upon the operation of a bank account and the making of GST credit claims when these facts were equally consistent with the orderly winding up of PGL.
