  First, the wording of subparagraph 50(1)(b)(iii) of the  
 Act 
  reflects Parliament's intent that of concern is not whether the formalities of dissolution or winding up have occurred. Rather, the concern is whether the corporation has ceased to carry on business, and it is reasonable to believe that the corporation will not thereafter begin to carry on business but, in due course, will be dissolved or wound up. This was the view of the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Turner 
 , cited above. It follows, in my view, that the fact that no formal process to dissolve or wind up the corporation was, or had been, taken could not be determinative of the ultimate expectation as of December 31, 1993 with respect to the formal dissolution or winding up of PGL.
