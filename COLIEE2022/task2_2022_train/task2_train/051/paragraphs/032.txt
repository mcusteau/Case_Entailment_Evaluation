  In my view, so long as on December 31, 1993 PGL was insolvent, it was not carrying on business, the fair market value of its shares was nil and it was objectively reasonable to expect that upon resolution of the lawsuit PGL would be dissolved or wound up and that it would not then begin to carry on business, the requirements of clause 50(1)(b)(iii)(A) of the  
 Act 
  would be met. In my opinion, this interpretation of the legislation is consistent with the ordinary and grammatical meaning of the words used by Parliament, with the decisions of the Tax Court of Canada in  
 St-Onge 
  and  
 Roy 
 , and with the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Turner 
 . There, as Justice Robertson wrote for the Court, at paragraph 2, "in short, it was not reasonably open to conclude that as of 1984 the taxpayer's company would be dissolved  
 and would never carry on business in future 
 ". (Underlining added).
