  The applicable standard of review to be applied to the Director's decision is to be determined pursuant to the pragmatic and functional analysis. Having considered the nature of the question to be decided by the Director, I find the following factors, discussed by Madam Justice Sharlow in  
 Lanno v. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
  (2005), 334 N.R. 348; 2005 FCA 153, at paragraph 6 to be equally apposite: 
 
 
 
 1. The fairness package was enacted because Parliament recognized the need for relief from certain provisions of the  
 Act 
  that can result in undue hardship due to the complexity of the tax laws and procedural issues entailed in challenging tax assessments. Any relief granted is discretionary, and cannot be claimed as of right. Accordingly, this factor points to a standard of review that is more deferential than correctness. 
 
 
 
 2. The fairness decision cannot be appealed, but it is subject to judicial review by this Court. It is not protected by a privative clause. This points to a reasonableness standard. 
 
 
 
 3. The decision under review combines fact-finding with a consideration of the policy of tax administration, and requires a proper interpretation of the relevant provision of the  
 Act 
 . The expertise of the Director is undoubtedly higher than that of the Court in relation to matters of the policy of tax administration. However, the expertise of the Director is not higher than that of the Court in relation to questions of law or findings of fact. This also points to a reasonableness standard of review.
