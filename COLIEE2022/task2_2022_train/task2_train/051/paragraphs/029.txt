  As for the effect of the facts that PGL continued to file annual returns and pay fees, this is consistent with maintaining the status of PGL until it was dissolved or wound up at the conclusion of the lawsuit. Moreover, until an amendment was made to section 208 of the  
 Canada Business Corporations Act 
 , R.S., 1985, c. C-44, am. 2001, c. 14, s. 101 (made effective November 24, 2001) an insolvent corporation, such as PGL, could not be dissolved because of any failure to file annual returns. Given that the failure to file returns and pay fees would not lead to dissolution, it is difficult, in my view, to infer that the payment of fees and the filing of annual returns were acts done to avoid dissolution.
