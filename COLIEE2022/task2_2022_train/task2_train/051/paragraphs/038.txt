  It is correct that subsection 18.1(3) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 allows the Court on an application for judicial review to set aside a decision and to refer the matter back for determination in accordance with such directions as the Court considers appropriate. The jurisprudence shows that on occasion the Court has remitted applications back to decision-makers with specific directions that, in effect, direct a specific decision. However, the jurisprudence cautions that this remedy should only be granted in extraordinary circumstances. Madam Justice Reed, in  
 Ali v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1994] 3 F.C. 73; 76 F.T.R. 182 (T.D.), at paragraphs 17 and 18, found the following factors to be relevant to the consideration of whether specific directions respecting a decision should be issued: 
 
 
 
 - whether the evidence on the record is so clearly conclusive that there is only one possible conclusion; 
 
 
 
 - whether the sole issue to be decided is a pure question of law which will be dispositive of the case; 
 
 
 
 - whether such question of law is based on uncontroverted evidence and accepted facts; and 
 
 
 
 - whether there is a factual issue which involves conflicting evidence which is central to the claim.
