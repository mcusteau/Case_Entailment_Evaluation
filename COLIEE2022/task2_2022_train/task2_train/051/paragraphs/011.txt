  The letter went on to explain that the following 10 factors were taken into consideration in arriving at the above decision: 
 
 
 
 1. No formal process was taken in 1993, or subsequently, to formally dissolve or wind up PGL. In 1994, PGL remedied a default in the filing of its 1993 annual return, and subsequently all annual returns were filed and fees paid. This was said to be "an indication of a lack of intent for PGL to be dissolved or wound up". 
 
 
 
 2. PGL was incorporated in 1987 to be a holding company, and at the end of 1993 it continued to hold its primary investment (that is, one-third of the outstanding shares of PDGL). It would not be reasonable to expect PGL to be wound up or dissolved as long as it continued to serve its primary purpose and thereby benefit from PDGL's consulting business or litigation. 
 
 
 
 3. With respect to the transfer of PGL's consulting business to PDGL, it would have been more reasonable for Mr. Simmonds to continue to use PGL as the home of his consulting business, since he owned 100% of PGL, but only indirectly owned one-third of PDGL. As well, there would have been no risk of PDGL's creditors gaining access to the consulting income. 
 
 
 
 4. A Notice of Intent dated April 25, 1991, served notice that legal proceedings would be commenced against the government of Prince Edward Island on behalf of Mr. Simmonds, his father and PDGL. When the suit was ultimately filed on September 10, 1996 PGL was one of the plaintiffs. The notes to financial statements for PGL as at December 31, 1993 (prepared after the commencement of the suit in 1996) disclosed that it was a party to the lawsuit and disclosed fees paid to the law firm that prepared the lawsuit. This was said to evidence PGL's 1993 participation in the preparation of the lawsuit. 
 
 
 
 5. Mr. Simmonds' linkage to the major plaintiffs in the lawsuit (PDGL and PFL) was through his personal holding company, PGL. This represented a sound reason not to wind up or dissolve PGL in 1993. Rather, any dissolution or wind up would be expected to await until either the settlement of the lawsuit or a change in the corporate structure. 
 
 
 
 6. The jurisprudence that Mr. Simmonds relied upon,  
 Jacques St-Onge Inc. v. Canada 
 , 2003 D.T.C. 153 (T.C.C.), was distinguishable because in that case it was a subsidiary corporation that was threatened with legal action that never materialized. In the present case, PGL is the parent corporation. Moreover, PGL was the plaintiff. Thus, it would not be reasonable to conclude that PGL would be wound up or dissolved because that would preclude it from commencing or continuing with the legal action. 
 
 
 
 7. PGL registered for the goods and services tax ("GST") in April of 1994, with an effective date back to 1991, and filed credit returns for reporting periods from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 1997. Also, PGL maintained a bank account after 1993. Neither fact was consistent with the behavior of an inactive company about to be wound up or dissolved. 
 
 
 
 8. Since the PGL shares were individually owned, and therefore governed by subsection 88(2) of the  
 Act 
 , any non-capital losses it had incurred would not be available to be utilized against future taxable income. As of December 31, 1993 PGL's potential taxable income included a damage award from the lawsuit and management fees earned from PDGL. A reasonable person would consider this as a factor against dissolving or winding up PGL. 
 
 
 
 9. The circumstances of the case were similar to the circumstances before the Court in  
 Turner v. Minister of National Revenue 
  (2000), 259 N.R. 92; 2000 D.T.C. 6442 (F.C.A.). There, the Federal Court of Appeal found that where a corporation commences a lawsuit, it is not reasonable to conclude that the corporation will be dissolved or wound up until such time as the lawsuit is settled. 
 
 
 
 10. PGL failed to meet all four of the conditions referred to in paragraph 5 of Interpretation Bulletin 126R2. Further, IT-126R2 was published for the purpose of subsections 88(1) and (2) of the  
 Act 
 . The position set out in the bulletin had not been extended to apply for the purpose of subparagraph 50(1)(b)(iii) of the  
 Act 
 .
