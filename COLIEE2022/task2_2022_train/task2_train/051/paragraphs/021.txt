The Minister argued that either the Director decided not to grant the extension or, (contrary to his affidavit) he overlooked the requirement to grant the extension, in which case the "best case scenario" from the point of view of the taxpayer would be that the matter should be remitted for decision as to whether to allow the election to be filed out of time.
