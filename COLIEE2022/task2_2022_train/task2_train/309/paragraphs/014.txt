When a claimant testifies under oath to the truth of certain allegations, there is a presumption that the allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness (
Maldonado v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1980] 2 F.C. 302; 31 N.R. 34 (F.C.A.), at paragraph 5). Therefore, the Board cannot arbitrarily doubt a claimant's allegations without valid reason. If the Board doubts the credibility of a claimant, it must state its reasons for doing so in clear and unmistakable terms (
Hilo v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1991] F.C.J. No. 228; 130 N.R. 236 (F.C.A.)). This enables the claimant to respond to the Board's doubts and questions regarding his or her claim.
