Later in his decision, the Adjudicator came to the following conclusions:
"[124] The totality of the evidence setting out the allegation is a pr√©cis or summary of a police report from a Crown counsel, along with a copy of the charge contained in the sworn information. ... What I have at best is a brief description from Crown counsel, which is second hand or double hearsay because it is the Crown counsel's view of a police report. ...
"[126] ... Mr. Brown seems to be under the impression that an accused person has a duty to cooperate with the police and to plead guilty. He seems to have been under the mistaken impression that Mr. Basra misled the police. Mr. Basra faces a charge of sexual assault and not obstruction of justice or public mischief.
. . . . .
"[129] ... There is no evidence that Mr. Basra deceived the police in their investigation. There is no duty on him to 'take responsibility', if in fact he is innocent of the offence, and he is presumed innocent until proven guilty. At best, the respondent's case is that it is a serious charge and it looks bad for the CSC to allow a correctional officer with a serious charge against him to continue working. ..."
