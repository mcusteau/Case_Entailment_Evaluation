According to the applicant, the Adjudicator erred in concluding that he had jurisdiction over the respondent's grievance, because the suspension of the respondent was administrative and not disciplinary in nature. However, the respondent points out that this was not argued before the Adjudicator, and submits that the applicant is therefore estopped from raising the issue in this application for judicial review. Furthermore, the respondent submits that, if the applicant's argument was accepted, this would mean that federal employees could be suspended indefinitely with no repercussions so long as there is no disciplinary "decision".
