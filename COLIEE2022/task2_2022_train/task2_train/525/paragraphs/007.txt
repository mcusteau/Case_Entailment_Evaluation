The Adjudicator concluded that the CSC was not justified in continuing the respondent's suspension without pay. According to the Adjudicator, one month was a sufficient timeframe in which to investigate the case, after which the suspension became a disciplinary suspension. Therefore, the Adjudicator concluded that the respondent was entitled to his pay, retroactive to May 3, 2006, one month after his suspension had begun, and to be reinstated to his position.
