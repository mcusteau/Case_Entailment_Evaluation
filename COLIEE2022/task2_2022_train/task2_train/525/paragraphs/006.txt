After summarizing the evidence and the arguments, the Adjudicator began by addressing his jurisdiction over the matter, concluding that he did have jurisdiction by virtue of his conclusion that the decision to suspend Mr. Basra was part of a disciplinary process, and was therefore caught by paragraph 209(1)(b) of the
PSLRA
. The Adjudicator stated the following:
"[98] The respondent submitted that the suspension was an appropriate administrative measure. Although the respondent did not directly argue the point, in order for me to have jurisdiction over this grievance I must conclude that there is a disciplinary component to the decision. In this case, the respondent claims that it has yet to make a disciplinary decision concerning Mr. Basra.
"[99] I note that paragraph 209(1)(b) of the
Act
uses the words 'disciplinary action' and not 'disciplinary decision.' The word 'action' is broader than 'decision' and is a word capable of embracing the CSC's decision to appoint investigators and indefinitely suspend an employee as part of that investigation. The CSC has suspended Mr. Basra indefinitely based on an allegation of a serious wrongdoing that the CSC determined must be investigated. Clearly, the decision to suspend was part of a disciplinary process, although the CSC has not yet convened a disciplinary hearing or reached a final conclusion on discipline. The respondent's documents establish that an investigator was appointed to convene a disciplinary investigation (Exhibit E-8).
"[100] Also, an indefinite suspension prevents an employee from working. It is an interruption of the employee's right to work. In this case the disruption of work, as well as the loss of wages, are penalties; they are disciplinary actions that flow directly from the CSC's decision to convene an investigation and suspend Mr. Basra without pay:
