The details of the charge are set out in a letter from P.A. Insley, Information and Privacy Coordinator/Crown Counsel with the Criminal Justice Branch of the British Columbia Ministry of Attorney General:
"According to the Police report, Mr. Basra first had contact with the complainant through a chat line. They eventually met for an evening of drinking and clubbing. On the second meeting the couple were at Mr. Basra's house having a few drinks before going out for dinner. After a few sips of the third drink which Mr. Basra made for her, the complainant began to fade, feeling unfocused and hazy. She awoke the next morning naked on Mr. Basra's bed. She was unable to remember most of the previous evening after the point of sipping the third drink.
"Reportedly, Mr. Basra gave the complainant a false name; however, the police were able to locate him from the complainant's cell phone records. When questioned by the police, Mr. Basra denied having had sex with the complainant or even knowing her and refused to give a DNA sample. A DNA warrant was obtained and Mr. Basra's DNA was found to match an exhibit taken from the complainant."
