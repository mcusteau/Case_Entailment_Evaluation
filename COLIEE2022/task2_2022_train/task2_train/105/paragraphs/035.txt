 [35] 
  In my opinion, the evidence brought forward by the Applicant on this ground remains in the realm of speculation. The Applicant's argument is, essentially, that disclosure of the key terms of the Crown Leases could subject the Applicant to a much more competitive environment concerning the Jasper Park Lodge than it has had to contend with in the past. In my view, however, a more competitive environment does not give rise to a reasonable expectation of a material financial loss or a prejudice to the Applicant's competitive position within the meaning of s. 20(1)(c) and its interpretive jurisprudence. The connection is too tenuous and not sufficiently proven in this case.
