 [33] 
  The grounds advanced on this issue are as follows: 
 
 
 
 a. if the terms of the Crown Leases are disclosed, a competitor could approach the landlord with more advantageous terms and attempt to acquire the lease on expiry or adversely affect renewal negotiations; 
 
 
 
 b. the Crown Leases deal with property located within Jasper National Park. The Park is subject to extremely tight restrictions on growth and there are limited opportunities for development; 
 
 
 
 c. the Crown Leases contain commercially sensitive terms, including the term, renewal provisions, rental amounts and default conditions. If this information is disclosed it will provide a competitive advantage to competitors and suppliers to the detriment of the Applicant.
