The applicant argues that the judge did not provide adequate reasons. In
VIA Rail Canada Inc. v. National Transportation Agency et al.
, [see footnote 17] the Federal Court of Appeal explained the basis upon which adequate reasons are formulated; the Court stated:
"The obligation to provide adequate reasons is not satisfied by merely reciting the submissions and evidence of the parties and stating a conclusion. Rather, the decision maker must set out its findings of fact and the principal evidence upon which those findings were based. The reasons must address the major points in issue. The reasoning process followed by the decision maker must be set out and must reflect consideration of the main relevant factors." [see footnote 18]
In the case at bar, the judge certainly needed to explain the criteria he used to find that the applicant had an insufficient knowledge of Canada and what percentage would have sufficed to satisfy the requirement of paragraph 5(1)(c). The judge erred by failing to provide adequate reasons.
