The finding that there were inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence presented by the applicant is problematic. The applicant submits that there are no inconsistencies between her application for citizenship and her proof of residence. In her citizenship application, the applicant said she was absent from Canada for 152 days and not 150 days as the immigration officer found, or 126 days as the judge found. The applicant travelled abroad after she had filled out the citizenship application, but before she had completed her proof of residence. [see footnote 8] This explains why there is a difference between the two forms. This argument is persuasive.
