Although the Court agrees with the applicant that the judge erred, the Court bases itself on reasons that differ from those presented by the applicant. The Court finds that, Alfonso is distinguishable from the case at bar. In
Alfonso
, Blais, J., noted that the judge erred in asking the applicant questions about the four topics identified in paragraph 15(1)(c) of the
Citizenship Regulations, 1993
, [see footnote 15] because paragraph 15(1)(c) prescribes that the judge ask questions solely on one of the topics identified in that paragraph. [see footnote 16] The Court is not persuaded that, absent that circumstance, Blais, J., would have found that the other four defects in the decision were sufficient to make the judge's decision erroneous in its formulation.
