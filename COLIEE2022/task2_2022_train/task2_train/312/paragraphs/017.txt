The immigration officer also erred in stating that there were several inconsistencies between the dates on which the applicant said she was absent from Canada and the travel date stamps in her passport. The immigration officer found that there were eight trips reported in the application for citizenship that she could not reconcile with the stamps and the dates in the applicant's passport. [see footnote 9] However, in reviewing the record, the Court reconciled four travel dates that are marked in the application for citizenship and the passport. [see footnote 10] Three dates in the application for citizenship are not in her passport. One date, which was stamped in the passport, "23 JN 1998", [see footnote 11] is not written in the application for citizenship. Yet the applicant stated in her application for citizenship that she was in Iran from January 2, 1998 to January 23, 1998, [see footnote 12] and there is no stamp for that date in her passport. It is possible, therefore, that the applicant wrote January instead of June by mistake.
