The judge found that the applicant did not satisfy paragraphs 5(1)(c) and (e) of the
Act
. In his decision, the judge said:
"The applicant has 1460 material days. She admits that she was out of Canada 126 days. This grants her 1334 days of physical presence in Canada.
"I have serious doubts as to the veracity of her dates and figures." [see footnote 3]
He examined her tax returns, her work outside the home, whether she is a member of any associations or organizations, her bank account and her purchase receipts. He noted that she did not have a Quebec driver's licence but still had one in Iran. He found that this evidence did not show that the applicant had resided in Canada for 1,095 days. [see footnote 4]
