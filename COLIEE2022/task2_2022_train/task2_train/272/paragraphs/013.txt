It was not perverse or patently wrong for the Board to find that Mr. Islam would be given a measure of state protection in Bangladesh. There is no clear evidence that the police themselves would still have an interest in persecuting him. As was held by the Court of Appeal in Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Villafranca (1992), 150 N.R. 232, the burden of showing that one is not able to avail oneself of the protection of one's own state is not easily satisfied. It is an objective test and it is not enough for a claimant to show that his or her government has not always been effective at protecting its citizens.
