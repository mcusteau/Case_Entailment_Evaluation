Mr. Islam's counsel led the Court through a detailed analysis of the evidence and pointed out that for every finding of the Board there was evidence or documentation which could have justified an opposite finding. He may be right. It may well be that I might have placed less weight on some of the documentary evidence and would have given more weight, or not have cast aside, some of the evidence which corroborated Mr. Islam's concerns should he be returned to Bangladesh.
