Similarly, as a general rule, the deemed member and the other member must dispose of the matter within the eight weeks stipulated in s. 63(1). As stated in
Weerasinge
, recourse to s. 63(2) is a serious matter which denies a claimant the right to a decision signed by two members. It was clear in
Weerasinge
that the member who did not sign the decision had been out of office for more than eight weeks. To repeat the words of the Court of Appeal, the departed member had "... been out of office for more than eight weeks and was disqualified from participating in the decision". If the Court of Appeal had thought that one member being out of office for more than eight weeks was sufficient in and of itself for relying upon s. 63(2), it would not have required "a complete statement of the material circumstances".
