DÃ©cary, J.A., in
IBM Canada Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue,
[1992] 1 F.C. 663; 129 N.R. 369 (F.C.A.), summarized the importance that the courts have traditionally placed on the strict compliance with quorum requirements at pages 673-4:
"... in setting a quorum and requiring that a minimum number of persons participate in a decision, Parliament reposes its faith in collective wisdom, does so for the benefit of the public as well as for the benefit of those who might be affected by the decision, and expects those who participate in the decision either as members of the majority or as dissenting members to act together up to the very last moment which is the making of one united, though not necessarily unanimous decision [footnote omitted]. Having the proper quorum at all relevant times, from the beginning up to the very last moment is a question of principle, or public policy and of sound and fair administration of justice."
