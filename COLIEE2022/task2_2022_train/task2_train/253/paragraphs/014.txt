This appears to be a different application and interpretation of s. 63 than in
Weerasinge
, supra. According to
Odameh
, supra, s. 63(1) is discretionary. If the Chairperson does not request the departing member to participate in the decision or if the request is made and that member does not do so within eight weeks, the remaining member shall, by simply so stating these facts, be deemed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with s. 63(2). This interpretation does not appear to give sufficient importance to s. 63(1) and greatly facilitates recourse to s. 63(2). The Court of Appeal in
Weerasinge
, supra, may not have intended the outcome in
Odameh
, supra, when it stated that recourse to s. 63(2) "... is a serious matter which denies the claimant a right accorded by the
Act
".
