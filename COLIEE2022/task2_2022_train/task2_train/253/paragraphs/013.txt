In reasons delivered orally by the Court of Appeal in
Odameh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1995), 185 N.R. 9 (F.C.A.), a decision appears to have been reached which may not be consistent with my interpretation of
Weerasinge
, supra. In
Odameh
, supra, the Court of Appeal confirmed a decision signed by only one member because the other had ceased to hold office. At page 10:
"Although it would not be undesirable for details to be provided by the continuing Board member, we believe it is not strictly necessary. If s. 63(2) is invoked by that member, with the explanation that the other member has ceased to hold office as a member, that invocation carries with it the clear implication that the departed member was not requested by the chairman to participate in the decision of the matter within eight weeks of departure and did not in fact participate in the decision either then or earlier. In our view, this is a sufficiently complete statement of the material circumstances in accordance with the
Weerasinge
rule. [see footnote 8]"
