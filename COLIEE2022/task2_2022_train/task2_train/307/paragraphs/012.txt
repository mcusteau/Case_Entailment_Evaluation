In conclusion, I find that there is nothing about the applicants' case which takes it beyond the usual results of deportation (Melo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 188 F.T.R. 39 at para. 21). Under such circumstances, the balance of convenience is in favour of the respondent as public interest requires that the removal order be executed as soon as is reasonably practicable (Celis v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 1679, 2002 FCT 1231 at para. 4).
