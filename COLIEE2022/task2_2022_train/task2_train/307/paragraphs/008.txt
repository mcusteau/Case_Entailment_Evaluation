Third, the Court notes that the risk to the applicants upon their return to Turkey has been assessed
twice
- once by the Refugee Division, and a second time by the PRRA officer. Both administrative tribunals made findings of fact that the applicants would
not be at risk
. In the case at bar, the Refugee Division clearly called into question the applicants' credibility as it found, based on the applicants' behaviour over a prolonged period, that they lacked the subjective fear of persecution that was the very basis of their claim. This Court has held that where an applicant's account was found not to be credible by the Refugee Division, this account cannot serve as a basis for an argument supporting irreparable harm in a stay application: Saibu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 151, 2002 FCT 103 at para. 11; Hussain v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 751 at para. 12; and Ahmed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] 1 F.C. 483 at 492-93 (T.D.).
