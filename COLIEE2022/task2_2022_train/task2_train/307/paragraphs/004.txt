The applicants made virtually the same allegations in their PRRA application as they did before the Refugee Division. The applicants' PRRA application was also rejected. In a decision dated June 6, 2003, the PRRA officer considered the applicants' allegations of risk based on their Kurdish identity, their religious beliefs as Sunni Muslims and followers of Fetullah Gulen (including the female applicants' claim concerning their wearing of the hijab), and, with regards to the military obligations of the principal applicant and his eldest son. The PRRA officer concluded that the applicants were not Convention refugees, and were not persons in need of protection pursuant to section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 ("IRPA"). It is the PRRA decision that is the subject of the within application for leave and for judicial review.
