Pelletier, J.
: On May 18, 2001 an adjudicator ordered that Ai-Ming Zhang and Zu Fa Zhang could be released from detention upon posting of a security deposit by "anyone" in the amount of $5,000 in the case of Zu Fa Zhang and $10,000 in the case of Ai-Ming Zhang. The Minister gave notice same day of an intention to apply for a stay of the adjudicator's order noting that the situation was urgent because the next detention review was scheduled for May 23, 2001 but nothing occurred until May 22, 2001. On May 22, counsel for the Minister and counsel for the respondents appeared. Counsel for the Minister advised the court that since the next detention review was scheduled to take place the next day, the court should hear the stay application, the leave application and the judicial review application since there was no other possibility of concluding the proceedings before the next day's detention review made them moot. Counsel for the respondents agreed to proceed in that fashion.
