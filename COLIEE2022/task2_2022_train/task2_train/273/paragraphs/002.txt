It is apparent that where the Minister seeks a stay of an adjudicator's decision to release an individual from detention at the 48 hour detention review provided in s. 103(6) of the
Immigration Act
("the
Act
"), the stay and the judicial review application itself will have to be heard within a 7 day period. This is so because another detention review must be held within 7 days of the first review. Once that review occurs, the order made after the 48 hour review is without effect and a judicial review of that order is moot. In those circumstances it would be helpful to the court if counsel filing the Notice of Application would advise the court that a hearing date for the judicial review will be required within the 7-day period.
