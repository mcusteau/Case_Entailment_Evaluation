In my view, the effect of a security deposit must be considered as part of the consideration of the question as to whether the detainee is likely to appear for removal. This in turn requires consideration of the character of the person posting the security since it is possible that the posting of security by certain elements will reduce the likelihood of the detainee appearing for removal. Consequently it was unreasonable for the adjudicator to order that the security deposit in this case could be posted by anyone. If he thought that security was required to ensure the appearance of the respondents for removal, he was required to direct his mind to the issue of the circumstances of the person putting up the deposit and their relationship to the respondent. If the Minister's representative had previously satisfied himself that the proposed surety was legitimate, the Adjudicator would be entitled to rely upon the Minister's representative's assurances. But if the Minister's representative put the matter in issue, then the Adjudicator was bound to deal with it.
