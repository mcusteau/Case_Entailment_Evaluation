The grounds of review which were urged upon me were that the form of order which was completed by adjudicator contained an error of law because at the place in the form which called for the name of the person posting the security deposit "anyone" was entered. Secondly, the decision amounted to a denial of natural justice because the Minister's representative had not been allowed to cross-examine the persons posting the bonds. And finally, it was suggested that the decision was unreasonable because it ignored the evidence of the respondents' links to the United States in favour of very tenuous links to Canada, it ignored evidence suggesting a significant likelihood of failure to appear for removal and it ignored evidence of attempts at deception which had been noted by the Immigration Officer who interviewed them.
