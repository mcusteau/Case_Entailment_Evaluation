 Harrington, J. 
  [Translation]: This motion is made in connection with an application for judicial review. The motion is seeking an order directing the defendant (respondent) to provide the plaintiffs (applicants) with additional documents. Pursuant to Rule 317, the applicants are seeking the filing of two documents and any changes to the said documents in the possession of the federal entity which took the impugned decision. The respondent maintained that the documents are not relevant since they were not before the decision-maker. Further, he noted that these documents were created only after the decision was rendered.
