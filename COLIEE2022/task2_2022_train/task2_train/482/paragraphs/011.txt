In her application for citizenship, Mrs. Mindich indicated that the reason for her absences from Canada over the winters of 1994-95, 1995-96 and 1996-97 was to visit her children in Israel. In her residence questionnaire, Mrs. Mindich indicated that "... the only reason I go to Israel is because my husband is ill and in hospital in Israel and I am unable to move him". There is an inconsistency as to the reason for Mrs. Mindich's absences from Canada.
