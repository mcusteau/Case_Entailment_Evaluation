While this comes before this court as an appeal from the decision of the Citizenship Judge, it is not necessarily a case where the court can simply substitute its opinion for that of the Citizenship Judge. As was pointed out by my brother Lutfy, J., in
Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] F.C.J. 410; 164 F.T.R. 177 (T.D.), the Citizenship Court is a specialized tribunal and its decisions ought to be accorded a certain deference given the special expertise of the Citizenship Court in its subject matter. This is reflected in the comments of Teitelbaum, J., in
Kerho, Re
(1988), 21 F.T.R. 180 (T.D.), at p. 184:
"... although the appeal is effectively a trial de novo, it is incumbent upon the appellant to show that the Citizenship Judge exercised her discretion on a wrong principle, or on a complete misapprehension of the facts or for some other compelling reason requiring my interference in her decision."
Teitelbaum, J., made his comments at a time when citizenship appeals were by trial de novo. His remarks are all the more apt in the context of an appeal on the record.
