  With regard to the applicant's section 97 claim, the Board did not believe that the applicant established the existence of a well-founded fear. The Board stated that there was a question of the claimant's credibility and overall behaviour. Certain facts were noted including the fact that the incident occurred in 1992, when the applicant was nine. The Board noted that the applicant's mother was also raped and continues to live in Haiti. The Board stated that the agent of persecution could not be identified. The Board noted that the applicant made a refugee claim in Canada, fifteen years after leaving Haiti. The applicant lived in the US and was over the age of majority for the final five years of her stay. The Board noted that a document had been produced indicating that immigration hearings had been undertaken in the US; however, it was noted that the outcome of her claim is unclear. For these reasons, the Board did not believe that the applicant's behaviour was commensurate with someone fleeing persecution.
