  The applicant argues that the Board erred by failing to examine the issue of gender-based persecution, despite the fact that it was explicitly raised by counsel at the hearing. The applicant submits that she is a member of the social group "women in Haiti", and more particularly, "women in Haiti who have been raped", not a victim of generalized crime. The applicant further asserts that the Board made a boiler-plate statement that it considered the  
 Gender Guidelines 
 , but that the reasons demonstrate that the Board did not consider that the applicant faced persecution on the basis of gender.
