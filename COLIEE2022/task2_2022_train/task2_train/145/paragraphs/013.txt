  The applicant argues that the applicable standard is that of correctness. This standard was applied in my recent decision in  
 Cius v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 1, at paragraph 13, [2008] F.C.J. No. 9. However, the question under review in the case at bar is not whether the social group alleged by the applicant indeed exists, as was the case in  
 Cius 
 ; as such the standard of correctness does not apply. Rather, the applicant argues that the Board failed to consider the central ground of her claim. The failure to consider the claim as it is put forward by the applicant constitutes a misapprehension of the facts and the evidence. As such the decision is reviewable on the standard of reasonableness ( 
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9).
