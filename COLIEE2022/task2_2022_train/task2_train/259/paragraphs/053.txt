There can be no doubt that the
PMNOC Regulations
are in their pith and substance regulations dealing with patents. An innovator (first party) can only come within the
Regulations
if it has filed a new drug submissions (NDS) or supplement to that (SNDS)
and
lists a patent claiming a medicinal ingredient, formulation, dosage or use (section 4(1) and (2) of the
Regulations
) on a particular list supervised by the Minister of Health. A first person makes a choice, it may list or not list a patent, it is not compelled to list a patent. If a patent is listed and a generic seeks the shortcut of an abbreviated new drug submissions (ANDS) by referencing the first party's NDS or SNDS then it must make allegations sent by a notice to the first party as to invalidity, non-infringement of the patent and/or other matters as set out in section 5. The generic must then wait since the innovator again has a choice, it may do nothing in which case, after 45 days, the generic's application for an NOC proceeds or, the innovator may launch a court application to prohibit the Minister from issuing an NOC to the generic, in which case the generic's application for an NOC is put on hold for up to 24 months until the disposition of the application. One way of disposition is by Order of Prohibition directed to the Minister in which case the generic must wait until the patent expires before getting its NOC. Disposition by way of a dismissal or withdrawal is another way, in which case the generic proceeds to get its NOC almost immediately. Merck points out that if an innovator loses at the trial level, the Court of Appeal rarely entertains an appeal since the Minister issues an NOC almost immediately, making an appeal moot. Section 8 of the
Regulations
, the provision now under scrutiny, provides that a generic may commence an action for compensation for being kept off the market by the stay afforded by the filing of the application by the innovator, if the innovator's application is dismissed, discontinued or withdrawn.
