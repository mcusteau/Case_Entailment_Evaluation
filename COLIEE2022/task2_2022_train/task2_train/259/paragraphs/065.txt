The Supreme Court of Canada has dealt with similar provisions on at least two occasions. In
R. v. Singer
, [1941] S.C.R. 111, Rinfret, J., for the majority at pages 115 and 116 reviewed provisions in several federal statutes which gave the
Regulations
made under these statutes the effect of the statute itself. He clearly appears to have approved of such a technique since he criticized the
Regulations
that he was considering in that case for not having such provision made in the enabling statute.
