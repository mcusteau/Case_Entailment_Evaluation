[81]
The right to take an action created by section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
is of limited scope. It only arises if an innovator chooses to commence an action under those
Regulations
in respect of a patent which it has chosen to list under those
Regulations
and is ultimately unsuccessful. The action is part of the overall scheme of the
Regulations
so as to create a balance, similar to an undertaking given by one seeking an interlocutory injunction. Section 8 is well integrated into the regulatory process.
