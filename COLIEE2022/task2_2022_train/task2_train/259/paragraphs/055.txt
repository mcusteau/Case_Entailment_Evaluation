Merck characterizes section 8 as providing a civil remedy without a wrong having been committed. Merck argues that the simple institution of a section 6 application and being subsequently unsuccessful cannot be said to be a "wrong" for which liability is created. This is a mischaracterization of the circumstances. Merck and others in its position have choices, a patent may be listed or not, an application may be instituted or not. Just like the institution of proceedings and seeking an interlocutory injunction, choices are made. Section 8 is a consequence of such choices. Merck and any other patentee has available to it all the remedies afforded to any patentee under the
Patent
Act
, it is deprived of nothing in that regard. In seeking the advantage of section 6, it must be presumed to have done so mindfully of section 8.
