The pharmaceutical of interest in this action is a drug commonly known as alendronate which is used primarily in the treatment of osteoporosis. Merck has an interest in a patent, Canadian Patent 2,294,595 ('595) which, among other things, includes claims directed to a particular dosage regimen for the use of that known drug, alendronate, in the treatment of osteoporosis, a known use. Merck listed the '595 patent with the Minister of Health under the provisions of the
PMNOC Regulations
which meant that any generic seeking approval to sell a generic version of alendronate in Canada for the patented dosage regimen for the treatment of osteoporosis and wanting to take advantage of simply referencing approvals already given to Merck for that drug could file an Abbreviated New Drug Submission (ANDS). In so doing a generic is required to send a notice to Merck alleging, among other things, that the '595 patent would not be infringed or was invalid, thereby permitting Merck to commence an application in this Court to prohibit the generic from marketing its generic version of alendronate in Canada in the dosage regimen claimed in the '595 patent.
