[74]
The
PMNOC Regulations
must be considered as a whole. Section 8 provides, just as in any ordinary court proceeding, a disincentive for seeking what is in effect an interlocutory injunction. It is like an undertaking given by a person seeking such injunction. It is part of a "
balance
" to use the words of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Biolyse
, supra, of the
Regulations
. It is a normal and expected balance having regard to undertakings given in Court proceedings such as those for patent infringement when interlocutory injunctions are sought. Subsection 55.2(4)(d) specifically provides for regulations respecting remedies and procedures in respect of disputes under subsection (c) as to when the NOC may issue. This includes the 24 month stay on any issuance of the NOC provided by section 7(1)(e) of the
PMNOC Regulations
and disincentives for seeking such a stay.
