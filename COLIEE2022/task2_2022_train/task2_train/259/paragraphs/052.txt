Merck has raised three issues: jurisdiction, enablement and constitutionality; all three issues are directed only at section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
. The result, should Merck prevail on any of these, is that at least this Court, and perhaps any court, cannot entertain an action as contemplated by section 8 of the
Regulations
. Apotex points out that, in directing its challenge only to section 8, Merck is content to institute applications under section 6 in the Federal Court, enjoy the 24 month stay afforded simply by instituting such application and, possibly gain an Order prohibiting the Minister from ever issuing an NOC to a generic so long as the patent in question remains in place.
