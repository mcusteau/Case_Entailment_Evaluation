A number of other issues were raised in the pleadings of each of the parties but have been resolved or dropped. Merck & Co. Inc. (Merck US) is a named defendant and several issues were raised by Apotex as to the nature and degree of its participation in the events under consideration. By consent Order, this action as against Merck US was dismissed. The two remaining defendants, Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. and Merck Frosst Canada & Co. are Canadian entities only the first of which was in existence at the time that the earlier NOC proceedings decided by Mosley, J., were initiated. The second of those two entities came into existence subsequent to the institution of the NOC proceedings (T-884-03). It appears that there was a transfer of assets from the first to the second of these entities. The pleadings take issue as to this transfer and the effect thereof however, these matters are no longer of concern.
