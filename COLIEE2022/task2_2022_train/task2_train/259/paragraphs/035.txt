One of the early concerns as to the
PMNOC Regulations
was directed to process. Section 6 provided that an innovative drug company that had listed a patent under those
Regulations
could, under subsection (1), "
apply to the court
", the balance of section 6 refers to an "
application
". The Federal Court of Appeal, in 1993, in
Bayer AG v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare)
(1993), 51 C.P.R.(3d) 329 determined that the most appropriate procedure to be followed was that provided by section 18.1 of the
Federal Courts
Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 and the
Rules
governing applications. Mahoney, J.A., for the Court said at page 336:
"What is authorized by s. 6(1) of the
Regulations
is an application 'to a court of an order prohibiting the Minister from issuing' a NOC. That seems clearly to be an application within the contemplation of s. 18(1)(b) of the
Federal Courts Act
. The application is required by s. 18(3) to be made under s. 18.1 and the prescribed procedures are to be found in Part V.1 of the rules. The learned trial judge did not err in determining that the proceedings are governed by the Part V.1 rules."
