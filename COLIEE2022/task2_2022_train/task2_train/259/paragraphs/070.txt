As its second argument, Merck argues that section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
is not enabled by an express grant of power in subsection 55.2(4) of the
Patent

necessary for the preventing of the infringement of a patent
" are words of constraint and that any regulation passed under that provision must be directed to such prevention and not otherwise. Merck argues that section 8 creates a new cause of action not directed to patent infringement but to punishment of an unsuccessful innovator in an NOC application.
