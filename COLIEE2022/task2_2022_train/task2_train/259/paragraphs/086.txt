[86]
The object of the
PMNOC Regulations
has been reviewed earlier in these reasons with reference to cases such as
Biolyse
and the expression of intent of Parliament has been given in the words of Minister Blais, as he then was, cited earlier. It is to create a kind of "
balance
" between the rights of patentees and access by the Canadian public to affordable drugs. It is not said that the balance is exact or perfectly even, but a sense of balance must exist. A person having certain kinds of patents relating to medicines is given a right to delay and possibly preclude a generic from getting rather easy access to the market by copying and referencing a patentee's innovations and testing, the generic is given a right, section 8, to compensation if the delay is unwarranted.
