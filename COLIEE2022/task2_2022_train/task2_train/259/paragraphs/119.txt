Excerpts from the discovery of Apotex were put in evidence at trial (Exhibit 4) in which there was the following exchange between counsel (Tab 1, pages 21 & 22), Markwell for Merck and Crowfoot for Apotex:
"Mr. Markwell: Sorry, to clarify your last statement. The damages that flow from those losses at law, what do you mean by that?
Mr. Crowfoot: Well, the damages that flow from that period because they were kept off the market during that period. The damages may incorporate things like lost market share which is a present value calculation.
Mr. Markwell: So it's not correct, then that your loss is restricted to the 16-month period, that it could be for the longer period of time?
Mr. Crowfoot: No, the losses in respect of the 16-month period being off the market. The calculation of that loss may involve the present value calculation of a lesser market share than Apotex otherwise would have had.
Mr. Markwell: During those 16 months or beyond those 16 months?
Mr. Crowfoot: The loss of market share occurs once they enter the market, and they only have an X percent market share instead of a Y percent market share. That loss is incurred as of the date that they entered the market because they cannot acquire the market share they should have. So the losses still occurred within the period, but calculating it may involve looking forward.
Mr. Markwell: So what would be the time frame for those future losses?
Mr. Crowfoot: The loss of market share would be perpetual, but it's the present value calculation that are the further out you get, the less financial impact it has. It's all a matter of expert evidence. I don't know how long it would be.
Mr. Markwell: So it's Apotex's position that there may, in fact, be a perpetual loss that would be calculated as of the date of the Notice of Compliance taking into account factors that will be subject of expert evidence?
Mr. Crowfoot: Yes."
