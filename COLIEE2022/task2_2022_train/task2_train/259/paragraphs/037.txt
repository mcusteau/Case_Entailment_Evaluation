The manner in which section 55.2(2) of the
Patent
Act
fits with the
PMNOC Regulations
as contemplated by section 55(2)(4) was considered by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)
(2000), 6 C.P.R.(4th) 165. Evans, J.A., in his minority decision in that case, canvassed the situation and determined that subsection 55.2(4) should be construed broadly. He said at paragraphs 40 and 46:
"40. Since the words of the statutory text do not point ineluctably to one conclusion, does the statutory context resolve the ambiguity? In my opinion, the nature and subjective definition of the purpose for which the power may be exercised supports a broad interpretation: '... such regulations as the Governor in Council considers necessary for preventing the infringement of a patent ...'.
. . . . .
"46. For these reasons, and in accordance with the general directive of section 12 of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985 c. I-21, I have concluded that subsection 55.2(4) should be construed broadly, so that its application is not limited to those who have availed themselves of the benefits conferred by subsection (1) or (2) in connection with the particular medicine in dispute."
