Merck received an NOC approving for sale its version of alendronate in Canada on February 4, 2002. Apotex filed an ANDS for alendronate on February 7, 2003 and sent a Notice of Allegation to Merck on April 14, 2003 alleging that the '595 patent was invalid for a number of reasons. On May 29, 2003, Merck & Co. Inc. and Merck Frosst Canada & Co. commenced proceedings in this Court, T-884-03, to prohibit the Minister of Health from issuing a Notice of Compliance to Apotex which otherwise would permit Apotex to sell a generic version of the alendronate drug in Canada. On February 3, 2004 the Minister send a letter to Apotex advising it that its application was approved but would be held in abeyance subject to the Court proceedings. On May 26, 2005, Mosley, J., of this Court gave Reasons and an Order in T-884-03, dismissing Merck's application, finding that Apotex's allegations as to invalidity, on some but not all grounds, were justified. These Reasons are cited as 2005 FC 755. No appeal was taken. On May 27, 2005, the Minister issued a Notice of Compliance to Apotex permitting it to sell its generic version of alendronate, Apo-alendronate, in Canada.
