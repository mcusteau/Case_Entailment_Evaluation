[96]
Thus,
where a patent has been infringed
, a patentee is entitled to seek, by way of remedy
an account
(meaning disgorgement of an infringer's profit) as an equitable remedy,
or damages
as a legal remedy. If damages are selected, one way of measuring damages, if the patentee makes or sells the patented product, is to determine the patentee's lost profit.
