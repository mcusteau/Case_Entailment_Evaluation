As I understand Apotex's claim, it is saying that during the period from February 3, 2004 to May 26, 2005, the marketplace for this particular product became distorted because two other generics entered the marketplace in that period. Apotex claims that, were it not for Merck's NOC application against Apotex, Apotex could have been first in the marketplace or at least entered the marketplace at about the same time that the other generics did and that Apotex's market share would, thereby, have been larger that it now is. Apotex argues that such lesser market share is a matter that permanently endures and is a matter of permanent loss. The loss, says Apotex, may be quantified by experts at the later trial.
