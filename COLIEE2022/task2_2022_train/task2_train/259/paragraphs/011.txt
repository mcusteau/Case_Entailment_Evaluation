In its earlier Statement of Claim, Apotex made a claim for unjust enrichment which claim was dropped at trial. By its counsel at trial, Apotex acknowledged that while during discovery some other grounds of damages were suggested none of such grounds are being pursued. Amended pleadings were filed at trial and are contained in a Trial Record (Exhibit 5). Apotex's counsel stated at trial that Apotex does not seek any relief other than that specifically claimed in the prayer for relief in its Further Amended Statement of Claim dated October 6, 2008.
