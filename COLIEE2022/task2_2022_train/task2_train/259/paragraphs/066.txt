, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 3; 177 N.R. 325; 122 D.L.R.(4th) 129, the Supreme Court dealt with provisions in the
Indian Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, section 83(3) which permitted an Indian Band to make by-laws providing for an appeal procedure as to tax assessments on lands in an Indian reserve. The by-law as passed by the Band provided for an appeal to the Federal Court - Trial Division.

Federal Courts
Act
the Federal Court has jurisdiction in respect of "
all cases ... in which a remedy is sought under authority of an Act of Parliament ... respecting any patent of invention ...
