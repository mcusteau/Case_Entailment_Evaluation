The
PMNOC Regulations
confer a benefit on a particular class of persons who own or have rights in respect of patents pertaining to medicines, their formulation, dosages and uses. Such a benefit is not available to anyone else. The benefited innovator person may choose to list its patents under the
Regulations
and, if notified by a generic that it is seeking an NOC possibly impacted by such a patent, the innovator may choose to launch an application to prohibit the grant of an NOC to the generic. In this way, the innovator having such a patent and electing to make such choices has an advantage in being given the right to commence a particular application, the mere commencement of which puts the generic application in a 24 month "
deep freeze
". If successful, an innovator will preclude the generic from getting an NOC at all which of course precludes the risk of patent infringement. Thus the regulations are directed to "
patent infringement
".
