[109]
The discretion that I am given in respect of that period is only with respect to the first date, February 3, 2004, the date that, to use the vernacular, the Minister has written to the generic to say that its application for an NOC is approved subject to "patent hold". I can only exercise my discretion under subsection 8(4)(a) if I am satisfied
on the evidence
that another date is more appropriate.
