The Courts have spoken more generally as to the
PMNOC Regulations
commenting upon the unhappy union created by dealing with both Food and Drug and Patent legislation (Hugessen, J.A., in
Merck Frosst Canada Inc. et al. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(1994), 169 N.R. 342; 55 C.P.R.(3d) 302 (F.C.A.) at page 304), and that it has created a minefield for litigants and counsel (my remarks in
Pfizer Canada Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Health)
(2008), 326 F.T.R. 88; 2008 FC 500 at paragraph 19 and
Searle (G.D.) & Co. et al. v. Novopharm Ltd. et al.
(2007), 296 F.T.R. 254; 56 C.P.R.(4th) 1 (F.C.) at paragraph 33).
