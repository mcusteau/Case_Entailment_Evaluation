Later at pages 167 and 168, Professor Sullivan reviews the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in the
Biolyse
, supra, approving of the majority decision. At page 168, she criticized the minority's approach to the
PMNOC Regulations
and concluded that "reading down" is a legitimate interpretive technique. She said:
"The dissent's failure to distinguish words of limitation from words of expansion invites confusion - as evidenced by the following:
Contextual interpretation does not justify departures from ordinary rules of statutory interpretation; in particular, reading in words cannot be justified in the absence of a demonstrable ambiguity.
"Insofar as this passage suggests that adding qualifying words to a text is inappropriate save in cases of demonstrable ambiguity, it is inconsistent with Driedger's modern principle. Contextual interpretation is the very tool required to determine whether reading down is permissible, that is, to determine whether it can be justified as interpretation or must be condemned as amendment. Furthermore, insofar as the passage suggests that reading in (as defined here) is permissible given a demonstrable ambiguity, it is seriously misleading.
"To summarize, while reading in may on occasion be justified as a constitutional remedy, it is not a legitimate interpretive technique. It amounts to amendment rather than paraphrase. Reading down, on the other hand, is a legitimate interpretive technique provided the reasons for narrowing the scope of the legislation can be justified in terms of ordinary interpretive techniques."
