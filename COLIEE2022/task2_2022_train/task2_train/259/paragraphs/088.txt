[88]
It is clear from the context of the whole of section 8 that what is provided for is that the Court may make an Order compensating
a generic for loss
in the prescribed circumstances. The Order may provide for "
relief by way of damages or profits
" as set out in subsection 8(4). There is no mention anywhere, except as is argued by Apotex, of any remedy in section 8 of disgorgement of any profit made by the first party such as Merck. The entire context of section 8 is focused on compensation for loss suffered by the generic. A reasonable, if not perfect, "balance" has been achieved. Here, the generic was, as it turns out, wrongfully delayed from entering the marketplace; it is compensated for loss occasioned by that delay. It is a reasonable balance.
