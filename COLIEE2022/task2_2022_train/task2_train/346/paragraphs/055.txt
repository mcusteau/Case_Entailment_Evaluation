[55]
In the present case, the alleged errors are the misapplication of the
Election Regulations
and breaches of procedural fairness. The appellate body under the
Election Regulations
, the Election Appeal Committee, does not have any specific ability to deal with errors of this nature. The remedies available through the Committee are limited to calling a new election, a by-election or a run-off election. The Committee does not have the power to reverse the removal of the Councillors or to reinstate them. Thus, the nature of the error and the nature of the appellate body suggest that the appeals process in the
Elections Regulations
is not an adequate alternate remedy, and that judicial review is the more appropriate remedy in this case.
