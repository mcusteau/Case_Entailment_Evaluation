The applicants argue that section 15.5 of the
Election Regulations
does not provide an adequate remedy. The procedure for an appeal under section 15.5 is the same procedure followed in appealing an election result under section 12.8 of the

. The remedies available all result in a by-election. There is no remedy under the
Election Regulations
to reverse the decision to remove the applicants and to reinstate them in their position as Councillors.
