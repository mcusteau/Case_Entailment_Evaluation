Finally, the respondents submit that both the
Election Regulations
and the Band's draft
Code
of Ethics
give the Council the power to sanction or suspend its members. The
Election Regulations
provide that council has the authority to take actions and decisions "for the proper governance of the Sucker Creek First Nation." The only authority expressly provided to the Council to deal with misconduct by Councillors under the
Election Regulations
is the authority to remove Councillors upon receipt of a petition signed by 50% plus one of the Band members. The respondents argue that not only customary practice, but also common sense and "the general law recognizing the power of a legislative body to sanction or control its own members" give the Council the authority to discipline Councillors short of removing them from office.
