The Court agrees that the Council has powers through custom which are not codified in the
Election Regulations
or elsewhere. The Council has the authority through customary practice to discipline or sanction Council members short of removal. For example, the Council had the authority to suspend the applicants' duties with respect to the ATCO contract, and I upheld this aspect of the applicants' suspension while granting the interlocutory injunction reinstating the applicants from their suspension. However, the indefinite suspension of Councillors who are elected for three year terms is effectively a removal, with serious consequences. Not only does it deprive Councillors of the ability to fulfill their duties before any allegations against them have been proven, it also leaves the constituents who elected them unrepresented. To achieve such an outcome, the Council must follow the removal procedure outlined in the
Election Regulations
. Further, as discussed below, the process used in suspending the applicants was lacking in procedural fairness. Even if there exists a general consensus that the Council has the power to suspend Councillors, a suspension carried out in this manner is a breach of procedural fairness and cannot be protected as a customary practice.
