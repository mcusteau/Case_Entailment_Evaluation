[56]
For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes:
a. the first application to set aside the decision to suspend the applicants is allowed. While the Sucker Creek First Nation Chief and Council have the power through custom to suspend or discipline the Chief or Council Members, the indefinite suspension of the two Councillors in this case is effectively a removal. The clear procedure for removal was not followed. In any event, the meeting called to suspend the two Councillors was not a "duly convened meeting". Moreover, the meeting lacked fairness in that the Councillors affected were not given notice or an opportunity to respond to the allegations against them which led to their suspension; and
b. the second application to set aside the decision to remove the two Councillors is also allowed. The decision removing the two Councillors is set aside. The
Election Regulations
were not followed in that there was no petition from 50% plus one of the electors seeking the removal of the two Councillors for one or more of the grounds set fourth in section 15.1 and 15.2 of the
Election Regulations
.
No Judgment on the merits of the alleged conflict of interest
