In reviewing the 53-page transcript, it is clear that the meeting was completely consumed by legal wrangling about "legal" objections raised by the lawyers including the allegation that Chief Jaret Cardinal could not rule on the removal of the applicants since he had commenced an action against the applicants in the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta for defamation. The meeting was adjourned with the agreement of all counsel that "once legal counsel has provided direction" the meeting will be resumed. (Ms. Kennedy agreed to that at page 52 of the transcript she said "o.k.".) Ms. Crook, also counsel for the respondent agreed to that. Ms. Crook said at page 52 "thank you". (Counsel for the respondents Ms. Kennedy and Ms. Crook agreed at page 52 of the transcript.)
