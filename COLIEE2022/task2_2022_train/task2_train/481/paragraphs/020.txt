Having placed s. 6(7) of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
in its proper legislative context, the interpretation urged by the Minister must now be considered. As indicated previously, the Minister advanced two propositions with respect to the interpretation to be accorded to s. 6(7): first, the making of an order against the Minister under s. 6(7)(b) is an "additional or supplementary remedy" that should not necessarily be made following the making of an order for production under s. 6(7)(a); and, second, the applicant must establish that "material differences may exist" between the information produced and the information in the submission for a notice of compliance before the court requires verification by the Minister.
