By letter dated June 17, 1999, Apotex sent SmithKline a notice of allegation under s. 5(3) of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
. In its notice of allegation, Apotex stated, in part, as follows:
"This is a Notice of Allegation pursuant to the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Com­pliance) Regulations
('
Regulations
').
"With respect to Canadian Patent Nos. 2168829 and 2210023, we allege that the relevant claims of the patents are invalid, and if valid, that no claim for the medicine itself and no claim for the use of the medi­cine would be infringed by the making, constructing, using or selling by us of tablets for oral administration containing paroxetine hydrochloride 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg.
"The legal and factual bases for these allegations are as follows:
"The claims of Canadian Patent Nos. 2168829 and 2210023 relevant to the
Regulations
are limited to particular forms of paroxetine hydrochloride, namely, paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate as defined in these patents.
"Canadian Patent No. 1038390, issued September 12, 1978, contains claims, inter alia, to paroxetine hydrochloride when prepared by the processes described within the claims.
"If valid, Canadian Patent Nos. 2168829 and 2210023, and the claims therein, do not include and cover therein paroxetine hydrochloride in the form disclosed and claimed in Canadian Patent No. 1038390.
"Until expiration of Canadian Patent Nos. 2168829 and 2210023, we will use and our tablets will contain only paroxetine hydrochloride in the form according to the disclosure and claims of Patent No. 1038390 and we hereby so undertake. Details of our paroxetine hydrochloride have previously been disclosed to you in connection with Court File Nos. T-2660-96 and T-2230-97, as exhibits to the cross-ex­amination of Jan Sedgeworth. More specially, Exhibit 1 was part 2 of volume 2 of our ANDS, and Exhibit 2 was the (drug master file) of our supplier. We hereby authorize you to refer to those materials for the purpose of dealing with this Notice of Allegation.
"In light of the foregoing, our paroxetine hydrochloride tablets will not infringe the claims of Canadian Patent Nos. 2168829 and 2210023. ..."
