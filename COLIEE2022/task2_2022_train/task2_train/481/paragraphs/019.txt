In 1998, the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
were amended in response to the April 1997 report of the Standing Committee on Industry reviewing the
Patent Act Amendment Act, 1992
. In that report, changes were recommended "... to the regulatory framework to address stakeholder concerns regarding fairness, effectiveness, and reduction of unnecessary litigation". In particular, several changes were made to the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
in an attempt "... to reduce unnecessary litigation and streamline the litigation process". (See Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement, SOR/98-166,
Canada Gazette Part II
, vol. 132, No. 7 at pp. 1057-1058). One of the changes specifically referred to in the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement as constituting a mechanism for reducing unnecessary litigation was the enactment of the provision, in s. 6(7)(a), permitting the court to order disclosure of any portion of the submission for a notice of compliance, if relevant to the disposition of the issues in the proceeding. A review of the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement therefore confirms unequivocally that, in enacting s. 6(7)(a), Parliament intended to reduce and streamline litigation. However, there is no specific evidence in the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement or otherwise concerning the legislative intent underlying the enactment of s. 6(7)(b).
