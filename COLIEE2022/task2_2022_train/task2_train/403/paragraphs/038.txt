In its reasons, the panel expressly states that it cannot accept Dr. Esmail's opinion as credible because it is based on a history as reported by the applicant. In his report, Dr. Esmail states at the outset,
"[The applicant] informs me that in a high speed chase that occurred on April 27, 1968, he sustained significant injuries to his neck and to his lower back. The patient can describe the chase very well and he has some photographs to prove his point. In essence, this happened in a field whereby he was jolted from side to side, up and down and finally the police vehicle he was driving hit a ditch. He sustained significant injuries to his neck and to his lower back." [see footnote 10]
