[34]
With regard to the medical evidence tendered by the applicant, the panel can properly reject such evidence when it has before it contradictory medical evidence. Sections 3 and 39 of the
VRAB Act
do not mean that any submission made by an applicant must automatically be accepted by the panel. The evidence must also be both credible and reasonable. If the panel rejects evidence based on a finding of a lack of credibility or reasonableness, the panel must state so and provide reasons.
