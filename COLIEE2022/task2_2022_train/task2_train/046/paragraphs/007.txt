 [7] 
  The Applicant attests that the situation in Jamaica for homosexuals continued to deteriorate following his departure from that country with the result that he determined he could not return. In the result, in August of 2007, he came to Canada and initiated a refugee claim here. The hearing of his refugee claim took place on the 29th of April, 2009. By decision dated the 7th of May, 2009, his claim was denied. While the presiding member of the Refugee Protection Division (the "RPD") found that the Applicant had testified in a credible and forthright fashion, that he had not embellished his claim and that he was in fact a homosexual, he found that the Applicant had only suffered discrimination in Jamaica and not persecution and further, that there were no objective grounds to support the Applicant's fear of persecution if he were required to return to Jamaica.
