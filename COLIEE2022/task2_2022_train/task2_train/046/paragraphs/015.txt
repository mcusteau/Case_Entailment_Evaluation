  The standard of review of a decision such as that here under review is, in respect of a pure question of law, or a breach of procedural fairness or natural justice, "correctness". In all other respects, the appropriate standard of review is "reasonableness". Where the "reasonableness" standard applies, the analysis will be concerned with: 
 
 
 
 "... the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law ..." [see footnote 2] 
 
 
 
 I am satisfied that the first issue raised on behalf of the Applicant is reviewable on a standard of correctness while the second and third issues raised on behalf of the Applicant are reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
