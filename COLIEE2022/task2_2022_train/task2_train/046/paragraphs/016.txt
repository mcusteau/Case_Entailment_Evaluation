  Counsel for the Applicant urged that the Applicant's marriage, occurring as it did after the RPD's decision in respect of the Applicant's refugee claim, was new evidence and represented a new risk factor if he were required to return to Jamaica. The marriage was highlighted in the Applicant's affidavit that was before the Officer and was referred to in the submissions that were before the Officer in the following terms: 
 
 
 
 "Since Jamaican law punishes any sexual intimacy between two men, whether in public  
 or in private 
 , Marlon's marriage exposes him to the risk of an immediate sentence of ten years of imprisonment with hard labour if he is forced to return to Jamaica. Marriage is not a crime and treating it as such is clearly persecutory. Moreover, sentencing someone to ten years of hard labour for exercising the fundamental human right to love and cherish one's spouse also clearly constitutes cruel and unusual treatment and punishment. 
 
 
 
 "Evidence of Marlon's marriage is therefore material to the determination of whether Marlon is a person in need of protection. Moreover, since the marriage took place after Marlon's refugee hearing, and Marlon was not living common law before the hearing, it is submitted that evidence of Marlon's marriage constitutes new evidence warranting the acceptance of this PRRA application."
