  In contrast, evidence  
 of a generalized risk precludes a finding of particularized risk 
  as required by section 97 of the  
 Act

 , [2009] F.T.R. Uned. 755; 2009 FC 1170, discusses this requirement in more detail. It is of note that the Board's analysis is with respect to section 96; the Board did not conduct a separate section 97 analysis.
