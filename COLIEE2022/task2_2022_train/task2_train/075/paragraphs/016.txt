  I agree with the applicant that the Board ought to have engaged in a meaningful discussion of the weight it was giving to the medical reports and ought not to have dismissed them. The problems with the applicant's spontaneous recall could have been explained by the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder ("PTSD"). The medical finding of PTSD is not "exclusively" based on her narrative of past persecution. Therefore, the report cannot be dismissed for the reasons stated by the Board member.
