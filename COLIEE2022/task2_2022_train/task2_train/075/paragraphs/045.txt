 [45] 
  At the request of counsel for the applicants, the following question is certified: 
 
 
 
 Can an assumption that rape is not a crime predicated on gender and reflecting gender imbalances be applied in an evidentiary vacuum, without regard to evidence demonstrating the contrary with respect to conditions in a refugee claimant's country of nationality? 
 
 
 
 Application allowed.
