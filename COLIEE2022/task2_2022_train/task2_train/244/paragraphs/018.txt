With respect to Mr. Keqaj's fear of persecution, on the basis of an alleged blood feud between his family and the Lenaj family, the Board found that there was no persuasive evidence before it of a serious violation of any of Mr. Keqaj's basic human rights or of a serious possibility that he would face persecution in the future. Moreover, the Board found Mr. Keqaj failed to establish that, on a balance of probabilities, the core events of the blood feud, had, in fact, occurred in 2004 or 2005, after the elders had settled the blood feud, in 1995. The Board also found it unlikely that Mr. Keqaj is being sought in Albania.
