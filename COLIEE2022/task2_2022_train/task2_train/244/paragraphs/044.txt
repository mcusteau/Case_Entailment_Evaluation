During the hearing, Mr. Keqaj testified that his father was still living in hiding at the maternal uncle's home, in Verrith, Albania. He also noted that the reason for his father having remained in Albania was that the family did not have the financial resources to do otherwise. Mr. Keqaj also explained that no further attacks had been perpetrated or any attempts made to reconcile the conflict as all of his male family members were in hiding because of the blood feud.
