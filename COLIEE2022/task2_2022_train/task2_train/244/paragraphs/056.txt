The country documents also address the availability of protection given by the police to targeted persons. Although the documents indicate that protection is available, those targeted are reluctant to avail themselves of this protection as they reportedly fear greater repercussions:
Although police officers have been known to assist in the reconciliation processes between feuding parties on occasion ... police intervention in such conflicts tends to aggravate the situation and can put a police officer's life at risk. ... [P] olice officers prefer to abstain from addressing blood feud cases out of fear of becoming targets themselves ... In some cases, police reportedly advised targeted persons to temporarily leave an area ... although further information on this approach or its effectiveness could not be found among the sources consulted by the Research Directorate.
