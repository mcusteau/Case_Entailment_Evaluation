  There is no assertion of a want of jurisdiction or of procedural unfairness on the part of the PRRA officer in these proceedings. The applicant submits that the Court has recognized that a broader range of exceptions should be accepted for the reception of new evidence and relies upon two decisions in support of that proposition: Omar v. Canada (Solicitor General) (2004), 23 Admin. L.R. (4th) 56, 2004 FC 1740 [Omar]; Salem v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (11 October 2005), Ottawa IMM-2494-05 (F.C.) [Salem].
