  What is missing is any explanation for the distinction between the incidents of common criminality and those of harassment/discrimination. I am unable to discern (from the reasons) how the stolen cattle in 2001 and the break-in of 2004 constitute “acts of common criminality”, while incidents of the stabbing of the applicant’s husband, the robberies in 2002 and 2003, the break-in of 2003 and the theft of the crops and damage inflicted on the property in 2000 amount to “incidents of harassment”. It seems to me that where the cumulative effect of a number of discriminating acts has the potential to result in a finding of persecution, it is not open to the RPD to place some acts of one side of the line and other acts on the other side of the line, without providing some rationale for having done so. Its failure in this regard leaves the distinct impression that the incidents were dealt with in an arbitrary manner. To complicate matters further, the RPD failed to have regard to all of the incidents delineated by the applicant. Again, counsel for the respondent acknowledged the evident deficiency in the RPD’s reasoning.
