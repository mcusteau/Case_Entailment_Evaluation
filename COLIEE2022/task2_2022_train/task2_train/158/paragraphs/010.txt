  The RPD (again at page 2 of its reasons) quoted from the DOS Report regarding the problem of land tenure. In so doing, the RPD cited a passage that described the difficulty associated with the alleged illegal evictions of Indo Fijians from farm lands and the reoccupations of those lands by native Fijian landowners. The RPD stopped short of referencing the passage in its entirety. The last sentence of the paragraph stating that “almost none of these violations were prosecuted” was omitted from the quotation. Similarly, the next paragraph indicating that Parliament had taken no action in this respect was also excluded.
