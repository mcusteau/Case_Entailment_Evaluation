  In my view, the RPD engaged in a selective analysis of the documentary evidence. Counsel for the respondent, appropriately, acknowledged that on the face of the RPD’s reasons, it appears that the member chose to refer only to those portions of the documents that would lend support to the finding of state protection thereby alleviating any requirement to confront the evidence to the contrary. Where there is evidence that may be critical to an applicant’s claim, it is essential that the RPD deal with that evidence. Selective reference to evidence that leads in one direction, without recognition of evidence to the contrary, is not appropriate.
