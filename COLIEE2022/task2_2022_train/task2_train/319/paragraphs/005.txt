Federal Court Rule 332(1) provides as follows:
"332(1) Affidavits shall be confined to such facts as the witness is able of his own knowledge to prove, except on interlocutory motions on which statements as to his belief with the grounds thereof may be admitted."
While some elements of the affidavit in support were clearly such that the affiant was able of his own knowledge to prove the facts therein, since he acted for the applicant in the submission of his application for permanent residence in Canada and in the pursuit of that application, as well as in the initiation of the application for judicial review, the content of paragraph 6 and exhibit E was clearly based on information and belief arising from the applicant's report to the affiant and was not within the affiant's personal knowledge. As such, it was clearly beyond reach on an examination for discovery and therefore potentially prejudiced the respondent although no effort was made by the respondent to cross-examine the affiant.
