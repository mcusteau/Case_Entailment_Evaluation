The processing procedure of visitor visa applications is contained in certain guidelines found in the
Immigration Manual
. Paragraph 3.13 of that
Manual
deals with interviews and reads:
"In some circumstances, it may be necessary to interview clients. Issues which may warrant the need for an interview would include two points:
(a) the existence of questions or doubts concerning the applicant's bona fides as a visitor, his/her qualifications and experience for the employment; and
(b) consideration of a refusal and a need to acquire more information before doing so."
