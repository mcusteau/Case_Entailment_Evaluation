Mr. Justice Teitelbaum, in
Flexi-Coil Ltd. v. Bourgault (F.P.) Industries Air Seeder Division Ltd.
(1988), 19 C.P.R.(3d) 125 (F.C.T.D.), considered a motion for particulars. While there were affidavits in support, none of them either showed the need for particulars or suggested that the defendant could not plead to the statement of claim until it had particulars. Mr. Justice Teitelbaum conceded that rule 319(2), which provides:
"A motion shall be supported by affidavit as to all the facts on which the motion is based do not appear from the record, which affidavit shall be filed; ..."
was not a hard and fast rule in that the court might waive compliance. However, he declined to do so and dismissed the application on the basis of insufficient affidavit material in support.
