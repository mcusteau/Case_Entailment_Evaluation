In answer to the defendant's concern as to the meaning of paragraph 21(c) of the statement of claim, which says that the defendant was not entitled to procure the
Pneumocort
trademark registration, the plaintiffs have referred to s. 16(3)(a) of the
Trade-marks Act
, which entitles a person to register a trademark, subject to confusion with a trademark previously used in Canada. The background as to the prior and ongoing use of the plaintiffs' trademark, including the scheduled particulars of registration of the
Pulmicort
and
Pneumocort
trademarks, and the alleged confusion between the two trademarks, leaves no doubt as to the case the defendant must meet.
