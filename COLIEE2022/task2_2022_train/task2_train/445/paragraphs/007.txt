In
Bell Canada v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.
([1991] 1 F.C. 356; 39 F.T.R. 97 (T.D.)) Muldoon, J., after citing rule 332(1) concluded:
"Accordingly, affidavits based on information and belief are insufficient."
In light of more recent jurisprudence, I do not regard that as the end of the matter. In
Ethier v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Commissioner)
, [1993] 2 F.C. 659; 151 N.R. 374 (F.C.A.), Hugessen, J.A., speaking for the court, and after referring to
R. v. Khan (A.)
, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; 113 N.R. 53; 41 O.A.C. 353; 59 C.C.C.(3d) 92; 79 C.R.(3d) 1, and
R. v. Smith (A.L.)
, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; 139 N.R. 323; 55 O.A.C. 321; 75 C.C.C.(3d) 257; 94 D.L.R.(4th) 590 stated:
"As we read them, those two decisions dramatically clarified and simplified the law of hearsay in this country. As Lamer, C.J., said in
Smith
, they 'signalled an end to the old categorical approach to the admission of hearsay evidence. Hearsay evidence is now admissible on a principled basis, the governing principles being the reliability of the evidence, and its necessity.' (At page 933.)"
Paragraph 6 is clearly hearsay. Exhibit E is its sole support. The reliability of paragraph 6, based on exhibit E, is clearly brought into question by the divergencies between the substance of exhibit E, the applicant's recollections of his interview with the visa officer, and the substance of the affidavit of the visa officer, filed by the respondent, which is clearly based on the visa officer's personal knowledge.
