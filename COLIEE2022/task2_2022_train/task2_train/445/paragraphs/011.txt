In
Li v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1990), 31 F.T.R. 290; 9 Imm. L.R.(2d) 263 (T.D.), the Associate Chief Justice clearly set out the role of a visa officer in assessing an applicant such as the applicant in this matter against various occupations. He stated:
"In
Hajariwala
[
v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1989] 2 F.C. 79; 23 F.T.R. 241 (T.D.)], I found that there exists a clear responsibility on the part of the visa officer to assess alternate occupations inherent in the applicant's work experience where the applicant seeks such an assessment by designating it in his application. Where his work experience suggests that the occupation may be appropriate, the visa officer must assess the applicant in the designated occupation, regardless of which alternate occupations the officer has seen fit to consider."
The visa officer here clearly assessed the applicant against alternate occupations. For reasons stated in his affidavit and underlined for emphasis in paragraph 12 quoted above, the applicant was not assessed against the occupation of production co-ordinator, his preferred occupation if he were permitted to immigrate to Canada, because "... he has not been involved with co-ordinating work between different units but was rather supervising the work within the single production unit".
