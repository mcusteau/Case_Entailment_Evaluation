  In  
 Choque v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 423; [1997] F.C.J. No. 1017 (T.D.), at paragraph 5, this Court held that when the assessment of the refugee claimant's credibility is at issue, the Board could take into account the circumstances of the claimant's departure from his country and the fact that he has encountered no difficulty in obtaining travel documents: 
 
 
 
 "Here, if the death or homicide of the applicant's brother did in fact cause Mr. Choque to have a subjective fear, the question naturally arises as to why he waited so long after the event before leaving Peru. Furthermore, during that period of time he continued to appear publicly on television and at concerts singing songs which were critical of the government. Once he decided to leave he had no difficulty obtaining a passport, going through the airport or getting a visa. Upon his arrival in Canada he waited almost five months before making a claim for Convention refugee status. The objective evidence, therefore, is that the applicant was not in any hurry to leave Peru, that he had no fear about letting the authorities know he was leaving nor did he encounter any difficulty upon his departure. It was entirely open to the Board to conclude that this evidence is inconsistent with a person who has a genuine subjective fear of persecution."
