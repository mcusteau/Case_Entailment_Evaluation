 [28] 
  In response to Mr. Toora's allegations at paragraphs 28 to 40 of his memorandum (Applicant's Record, at pages 118-20), it is up to the Board to assess the probative value of the explanations given by Mr. Toora in relation to his conduct, like any other evidence: 
 
 
 
 "It certainly cannot be argued, in my view, that the Board was not entitled to consider, as a relevant factor, the applicants' failure to claim refugee status either in Costa Rica or the United States. The applicants' explanation for their failure to claim was that they were not aware that they could claim refugee status elsewhere and that, in any event, their intention had always been to come to Canada. 
 
 
 
 "Whether that explanation was a reasonable one or not was for the Board to decide. I am satisfied that the Board did not make a reviewable error when it concluded that the applicants' failure to claim either in Costa Rica or in the United States was a relevant factor in the assessment of the applicants' subjective fear."
