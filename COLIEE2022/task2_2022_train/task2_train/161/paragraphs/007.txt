  Mr. Toora claims that he joined his uncle who was working as a taxi driver in New York City and remained there until the time he crossed the border in the Lacolle area, with the help of an immigration agent, to enter Canada on December 2, 2004, without going through any border crossing. He says he paid US $4,000 and gave his passport to the immigration agent who had got him into Canada.
