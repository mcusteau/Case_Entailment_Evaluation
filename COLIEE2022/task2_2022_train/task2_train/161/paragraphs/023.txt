  In addition, as it was held in  
 Miranda v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1993] F.C.J. No. 437; 63 F.T.R. 81 (T.D.), certain discrepancies between the English original and the translated copy cannot affect the validity of the Board's decision and the Board's duty to give reasons for its decision: 
 
 
 
 "For purposes of judicial review, however, it is my view that a Refugee Board decision must be interpreted as a whole. One might approach it with a pathologist's scalpel, subject it to a microscopic examination or perform a kind of semantic autopsy on particular statements found in the decision. But mostly, in my view, the decision must be analyzed in the context of the evidence itself. I believe it is an effective way to decide if the conclusions reached were reasonable or patently unreasonable."
