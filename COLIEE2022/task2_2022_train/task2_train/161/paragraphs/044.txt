  Similarly, in  
 Muthiyansa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2001] F.T.R. Uned. 52; [2001] F.C.J. No. 162; 2001 FCT 17, at paragraphs 24-25, Madam Justice Dolores Hansen said: 
 
 
 
 "I am also of the view that the panel identified the elements of the applicant's story, which in the end, led to its negative credibility finding. Suffice it to say, that in weighing and assessing the applicant's evidence, the panel has concluded that the truth of her story is not in 'harmony with the preponderance of the probabilities which a practical and informed person would readily recognize as reasonable in that place and in those conditions.' ( 
 Farnya v. Chorny 
 , [1952] 2 D.L.R. 354 at 357 (B.C.C.A.). 
 
 
 
 "In the final analysis, it is open to the CRDD to reject uncontradicted evidence if that evidence does not accord with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole. In my opinion, this is what it has done here ( 
 Alizadeh v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 ), [1993] F.C.J. No. 11 (F.C.A.))."
