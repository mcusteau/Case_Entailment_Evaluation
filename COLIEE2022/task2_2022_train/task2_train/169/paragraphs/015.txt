  In this case, it appears that Instruction #2 applies directly to the Applicant's lack of knowledge about her intended husband. Both parties referred to the decision of Justice MacTavish in  
 Diallo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2004), 259 F.T.R. 273; 2004 FC 1450. That case involved facts remarkably similar to those in this case - a young woman from Mali who came as a student to the same college in Canada and claimed a fear on the basis of a forced marriage. With respect to the application of the  
 Gender Guidelines 
 , Justice MacTavish, at paras. 32-33, stated as follows: 
 
 
 
 "The Chairperson's  
 Gender Guidelines 
  recognize that cross-cultural misunderstandings can come into play when gender-based claims are assessed by the Board. In order to minimize the risk of this happening, members are alerted to the effect that social, cultural, traditional and religious norms can have on the testimony of those claiming to fear gender-based persecution. 
 
 
 
 "In this case, the Board's reasoning as to the need to consider the  
 Gender Guidelines 
  is somewhat circular. The Board held that it did not have to consider the applicability of the  
 Gender Guidelines 
  because Ms. Diallo was not credible. However, the  
 Gender Guidelines 
  exist, in part, to ensure that social, cultural, traditional and religious norms do not interfere with the proper assessment of an Applicant's credibility."
