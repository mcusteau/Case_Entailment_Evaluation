  The second document tendered as new facts is an excerpt from a medical text  
 Neurology in Clinical Practice 
 . The excerpt does not address the Applicant's capacity to work as of August 27, 1998. The information is not material to the issue which was the subject of the August 27, 1998 decision and is therefore not new facts evidence.
