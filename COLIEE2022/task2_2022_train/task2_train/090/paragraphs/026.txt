 [26] 
  Subsection 84(2) of the  
 CPP 
  has been narrowly interpreted by the courts. The intrinsic limitation of the provision was acknowledged by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v. Landry 
  (2005), 334 N.R. 176; 2005 FCA 167, at paragraph 7. The provision is applicable in exceptional circumstances where, despite due diligence, relevant material becomes available to a current application outside the expiration of the appeal limitation.
