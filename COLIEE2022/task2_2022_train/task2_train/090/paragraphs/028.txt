  To be considered new facts for the purposes of subsection 84(2) of  
 CPP 
 , new information must not have been previously discoverable with reasonable diligence at the time of the original hearing ( 
 Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) v. Macdonald 
 , [2002] N.R. Uned. 26; [2002] F.C.J. No. 197; 2002 FCA 48). This implies that the information must have existed at that time. Further, to be considered new facts, the information must also be material. The Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Leskiw v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [2003] N.R. Uned. 182; 2003 FCA 345, at paragraph 5 of its reasons for decision held that, to be material, the new evidence must be "practically conclusive". The Federal Court of Appeal in  
 BC Tel v. Seabird Island Indian Band 
 , [2003] 1 F.C. 475; 292 N.R. 120; 2002 FCA 288, elaborated on this test by finding that new evidence has been held to be practically conclusive if it could reasonably be expected to affect the result of the prior hearing.
