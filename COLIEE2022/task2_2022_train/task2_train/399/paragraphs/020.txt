The respondent also relies on Xiong v.Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 430, [2002] F.C.J. No. 546. In that case, Layden-Stevenson J. states that "[t]he affidavit of the visa officer sets out, in detail, the reasons for her decision.
It is the uncontradicted evidence of the visa officer that she explained her concerns to the applicant at the conclusion of the interview
, informed him of the refusal and provided him with the opportunity to ask questions, rebut or provide additional information" (my emphasis). I personally find that this case is distinguishable. In the case at bar, nowhere in the CAIPS notes or the letter of refusal does the visa officer mention that she communicated her concerns to the applicant. Moreover, there was no interview here.
