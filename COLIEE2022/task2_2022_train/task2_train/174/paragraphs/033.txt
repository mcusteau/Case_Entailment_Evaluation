  Finally, the decision of this Court (affirmed by the Court of Appeal at [2010] FCA 169) in  
 Nekaneet First Nation 
 ,  
 supra 
 , is also instructive. The election of the Applicants as the band council of Nekaneet was based on a band custom passed at the Referendum Vote of the eligible voters of Nekaneet. The Referendum Vote approving the  
 Nekaneet Constitution 
  and the  
 Nekaneet Governance Act 
  which together formed the Referendum Band Custom, was intended to replace any previous band customs of Nekaneet, and it could only be amended or repealed by a subsequent referendum held in accordance with the Nekaneet Constitution. The election of the respondents as the band council of Nekaneet on the same voting day was based on the Second Band Custom passed by a show of hands at a Nekaneet band meeting called for such purpose.
