  For the reasons that follow, I have come to the conclusion that this application for judicial review ought to be dismissed. The  
 Kahkewistahaw Election Act 
  (the  
 Election Act 
  or  
 Act 
 ) was validly enacted, and the process whereby the Election was held was fair and in compliance with the  
 Election Act 
 .
