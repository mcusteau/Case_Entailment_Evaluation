  The various grounds of discrimination expressly listed in subsection 15(1) reflect the most common and most obvious bases of discrimination. However, these are not the only grounds upon which discrimination may be found. In her majority reasons elaborating on this issue, Justice Wilson explained (at p 152) that a ground may qualify as analogous to those listed in subsection 15(1) if persons characterized by the trait in question are, among other things, "lacking in political power", "vulnerable to having their interests overlooked and their rights to equal concern and respect violated", and "vulnerable to becoming a disadvantaged group" on the basis of that trait.
