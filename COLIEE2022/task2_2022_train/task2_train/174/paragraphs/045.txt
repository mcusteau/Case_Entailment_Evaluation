  The Applicant challenges the decision of the Elections Officer to disqualify him on the basis of paragraph 9.03(c), on the ground that she did not examine the basis upon which the honourary certificates are granted and gave insufficient consideration to the fact that they were meant to recognize accomplishment. As the certificate was granted to the Applicant by an educational authority to worthy individuals who incorporate qualities they wish to foster in their students, counsel argued that it is the equivalent of formal education. Moreover, the Applicant argued that it was unfair not to be given any opportunity to be heard by the Elections Officer in relation to the eligibility issue.
