  As for the alleged breach of procedural fairness raised by Mr. Taypotat, it is trite law that the applicable standard of review is that of correctness: ( 
 Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) v Ontario (Minister of Labour), 
  2003 SCC 29, [2003] 1 SCR 539 at paras 100-104;  
 Sketchley v Canada (Attorney General), 
  2005 FCA 404, [2005] 3 FCR 392at para 111). If there is such a breach, this Court will therefore intervene.
