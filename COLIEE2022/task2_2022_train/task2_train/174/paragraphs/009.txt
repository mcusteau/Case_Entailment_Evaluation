  Between March 5 and March 18, 2008, the proposed  
 Election Act 
  was distributed to the membership of the First Nation, and on July 21, 2008, the band council approved the Notice of Ratification Vote for that Act. On September 6, 2008, the first ratification vote was held but was unsuccessful because of low voter turnout. Out of 984 eligible voters, only 164 ballots were cast, with 120 approving the  
 Election Act 
 , and 44 rejecting it.
