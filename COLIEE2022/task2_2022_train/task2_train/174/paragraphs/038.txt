  Having carefully reviewed the evidence on the record, I cannot accede to those arguments. The affidavits and exhibits filed by the Respondents indicate that an extensive process was undertaken to prepare the  
 Election Act 
 , consult with First Nation members, explain the  
 Election Act 
 , seek input from First Nation members and implement their wishes regarding the education provisions of the  
 Election Act 
 . The First Nation was involved in the process of developing and ratifying the  
 Election Act 
  on an ongoing basis for 13 years, with much of it under the leadership of Louis Taypotat. An extensive information and ratification process was undertaken, and there was plenty of opportunity for First Nation members to ask questions, receive answers, and understand the  
 Election Act 
 . This process was conducted publicly and openly, and the ratification votes were conducted by secret ballot.
