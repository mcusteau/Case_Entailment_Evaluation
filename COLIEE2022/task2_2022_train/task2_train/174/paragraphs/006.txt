  The first draft of the proposed  
 Election Act 
  was prepared in 1998 and included a provision that required "formal education at a post-secondary level or equivalent education/experience" in order for a candidate to be eligible for election to Chief or Council. Later drafts of the  
 Election Act 
  removed the "experience" component. The relevant sections of the  
 Election Act 
  are as follows:
