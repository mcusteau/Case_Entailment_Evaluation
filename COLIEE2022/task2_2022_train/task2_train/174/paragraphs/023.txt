 [23] 
  The Applicant is challenging the process that led to the adoption of the  
 Election Act 
  and, therefore, its validity, as well as the interpretation of that Act (and in particular paragraph 9.03(c)) by the Elections Officer. These arguments far outreach the grounds for appeal found in section 18.02 of the  
 Act 
 , as the Applicant is not claiming that the Act was violated. Accordingly, the appeal procedure provided for in the  
 Election Act 
  would be of no avail to the Applicant, and cannot be considered an adequate alternative remedy.
