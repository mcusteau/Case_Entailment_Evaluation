 [55] 
  It is trite law that not every distinction or differentiation in treatment will infringe the equality guarantee of section 15 of the  
 Charter 
 . As the Supreme Court stated in  
 Law Society British Columbia v Andrews 
 , [1989] 1 SCR 143, it is only those distinctions that are discriminatory in their intent or their effect that will run afoul of that constitutional guarantee. This was expressed most clearly by Justice McIntyre in the following excerpt (at para 37): 
 
 
 
 I would say then that discrimination may be described as a distinction, whether intentional or not but based on grounds relating to personal characteristics of the individual or group, which has the effect of imposing burdens, obligations, or disadvantages on such individual or group not imposed upon others, or which withholds or limit access to opportunities, benefits, and advantages available to other members of society. Distinctions based on personal characteristics attributed to an individual solely on the basis of association with a group will rarely escape the charge of discrimination, while those based on an individual's merits and capacities will rarely be so classed.
