  The  
 Indian Act 
  itself does not set out guidelines as to how a band custom is to be identified. The jurisprudence has filled in the gap, and it is now well established that, in order to establish the custom of the band in relation to elections for Chief and Council, it is necessary to show that the alleged custom is supported by a "broad consensus" of the members of the First Nation. This principle was established in  
 Bigstone v Big Eagle, 
  [1992] FCJ no 16, 52 FTR 109 (CA), where Justice Strayer stated (at p. 8): 
 
 
 
 Unless otherwise defined in respect of a particular band, "custom" must I think include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus. ... The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the Band?
