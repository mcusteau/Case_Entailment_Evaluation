  The Policy allows the adoption of a custom election code by a majority of the electors of the First Nation or if "the community approves them in such other manner as the First Nation and the department may agree upon" (Applicant's Record, vol. II, p. 453). The new Chief sought approval from the Department to have a continuation vote on adopting the  
 Election Act 
 , and received approval to do so. On January 22, 2010, a continuation vote (the "Continuation Vote") was held where voters who were eligible to vote in the Second Vote but did not do so could cast ballots. Of the 776 eligible voters, 252 voted in favour of adopting the Act, with 31 voting against and 7 votes were rejected, spoiled or done improperly. When these results are added to the Second Vote, the total number of eligible voters was 1007, of which 483 voted, 409 in favour of adopting the  
 Act 
  and 72 opposing it. This participation rate was 22 votes shy of a majority of eligible voters.
