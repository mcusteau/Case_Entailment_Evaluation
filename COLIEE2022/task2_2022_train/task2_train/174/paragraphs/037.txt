  The Applicant submitted that, given that it was necessary to resort to holding a two-part vote over a protracted period of time in the face of an initial failure, broad consensus on adopting the  
 Election Act 
  was not demonstrated. The Applicant further argued that many members of the First Nation boycotted the voting as a result of the fact that those who were proposing the  
 Election Act 
 , were not respecting the complaints made about the educational requirement. This non-participation, it is contended, was a sign of disagreement as the opposition was not passive.
