  It would appear that the category of "particular social group" had been suggested at the last minute to the drafters of the Convention. He concluded at page 739: 
 
 
 
 The meaning assigned to "particular social group" in the Act should take into account the general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination that form the basis for the international refugee protection initiative. The tests proposed in Mayers, supra, Cheung, supra, and Matter of Acosta, supra, provide a good working rule to achieve this result. They identify three possible categories: 
 
 
 
 (1) groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic; 
 
 
 
 (2) groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and 
 
 
 
 (3) groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence. 
 
 
 
 The first category would embrace individuals fearing persecution on such bases as gender, linguistic background and sexual orientation, while the second would encompass, for example, human rights activists. The third branch is included more because of historical intentions, although it is also relevant to the anti-discrimination influences, in that one's past is an immutable part of the person.
