  The concept of "mixed motives" considered by both Mr. Justice Blanchard and Mr. Justice Simon NoÃ«l is well known. In granting judicial review, I shall refer the matter back to the RPD Member who decided the case, Ms. Bruin, for reconsideration. If she thinks A011 is a refugee because of mixed motives, rather than because of membership in a particular social group, then let her say so.
