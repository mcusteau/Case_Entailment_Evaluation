  If this matter is not taken to the Court of Appeal, we will find ourselves in a situation akin to the meaning of "residence" in the  
 Citizenship Act 
 . There are currently three schools of thought, so that the outcome is often a matter of pure chance. While no appeal lies from a decision of this Court under the  
 Citizenship Act 
 , an appeal does lie under the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 .
