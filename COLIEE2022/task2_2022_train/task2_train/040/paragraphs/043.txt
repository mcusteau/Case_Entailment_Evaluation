 [43] 
  Given that  
 Ward 
  was decided by four members of the Supreme Court, as the fifth justice who heard the case, Mr. Justice Stephenson, did not participate in the deliberations; given that  
 Ward 
  was decided before s. 97 of IRPA was enacted in 2001, and given that  
 Ward 
  did not purport to set out closed immutable categories of particular social groups, I am not prepared to find that the decision was unreasonable. I find, just as in the case of  
 B472 
 , that the decision was incorrect.
