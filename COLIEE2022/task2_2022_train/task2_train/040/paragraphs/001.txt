 Harrington, J. 
 : When A011, a Tamil male, left Sri Lanka, he did not face a serious risk of persecution. However, because he came to Canada on the Ocean Lady, a precursor to the Sun Sea, he was found by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD], of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [IRB], to be a refugee sur place. The Minister seeks judicial review of that decision.
