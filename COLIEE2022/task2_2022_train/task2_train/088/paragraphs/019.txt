  The second issue under review - that the Officer ignored relevant evidence - engages the principles of procedural fairness. Such matters fall within the exclusive province of the Court and are reviewable on the standard of correctness. No deference is due. See:  
 Canadian Union of Public Employees (C.U.P.E.) v. Ontario (Minister of Labour) 
 , 2003 SCC 29, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539 at para. 100. The Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Dunsmuir 
  confirmed that issues of fairness, which lie at the heart of the administration of justice, remain squarely within the supervising function of the Court. See:  
 Dunsmuir 
  at paras. 60 and 151.
