  Ms. Chertyuk also argues that the Officer erred by failing to refer expressly to section 4 of the Regulations and by implicitly introducing an irrelevant factor, namely that a genuine marriage must be one between two heterosexual persons. The Minister disagrees, arguing that the Officer introduced no such criterion and that her reasons were "clearly in line" with the Regulations. After reviewing the Officer's reasons as a whole, I am unable to agree with the interpretation adopted by Ms. Chertyuk.
