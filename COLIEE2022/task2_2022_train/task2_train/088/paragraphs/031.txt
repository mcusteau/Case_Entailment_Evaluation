  In determining whether a marriage is genuine, an officer is required to assess the credibility of an applicant and make findings of fact based on the record before him or her. As part of that analysis, an officer is required to consider all of the relevant evidence. It was not improper for the Officer to consider the timing of Ms. Chertyuk's relationship in light of her immigration history. This is not to say that timing is determinative of whether or not a marriage is genuine. Rather, it is to say that timing is but one factor that may be considered in assessing the genuineness of a marriage for the purpose of the Spousal Class. In this case, the negative decision of the Officer was grounded only in part on the timing of the relationship. While Ms. Chertyuk is right in pointing out that the decision in  
 Donkor 
  recognizes that a marriage originally entered into for the purpose of gaining status under the Act may later become genuine, that principle is not applicable in this case. It is clear that the Officer, even at the date of the decision, was not satisfied that Ms. Chertyuk and Mr. Shishmanov were in a genuine marital relationship: 
 
 
 
 I am not satisfied that the applicant and her spouse/sponsor are in a bona fide marital relationship.
