 [29] 
  The failure of the Officer to refer expressly to section 4 of the Regulations does not give rise to a reviewable error. When the Officer's reasons are read as a whole, it is clear that she was guided by the proper legal considerations: 
 
 
 
 [A] foreign national is not considered a spouse or common-law partner if the marriage or relationship is not genuine or was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act. 
 
 
 
 I am not satisfied that this marriage was not entered into primarily for Immigration purposes, as such you do not meet the requirements of the class and your application for permanent residence as a member of the spouse and common-law partner in Canada class is, therefore, refused. 
 
 
 
 As to the suggestion by Ms. Chertyuk that the Officer improperly considered that a genuine marriage is strictly one between two heterosexual persons, the Officer's decision, reasons and notes reveal no such consideration - express or implied.
