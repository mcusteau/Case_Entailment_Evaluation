  As the Minister rightly observes, section 124 of the Regulations must be read together with section 4 of the Regulations. See:  
 Cao v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2006 FC 1408, 58 Imm. L.R. (3d) 218 at paras. 8 and 24. Under section 124, a foreign national, such as Ms. Chertyuk, will be considered to be a member of the Spousal Class if she is the spouse of a sponsor and cohabits with that sponsor in Canada. In other words, section 124 defines the membership parameters of the Spousal Class. It does not, as Ms. Chertyuk suggests, define who is, or is not, a "spouse" for the purpose of the Regulations. That definition is found in section 4, which requires a foreign national to demonstrate that his or her marriage is genuine and not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status under the Act. Accepting the interpretation proffered by Ms. Chertyuk would lead to the absurd result that every foreign national with a certificate of marriage and documentary proof of cohabitation would be a "spouse" within the meaning of the Spousal Class. This would ignore the clear intent and broad scope of section 4 of the Regulations.
