  The first issue raised in this application is one of law. The Court has previously taken the view that the correctness standard of review is applicable to such a question, see:  
 Mohamed v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2006 FC 696, 296 F.T.R. 73 at para. 34. I can see no justifiable basis for departing from that view in this case. As the Supreme Court of Canada made clear in  
 Dunsmuir 
 , the correctness standard remains appropriate where a question of general law is raised. Given the impact of such an issue on the administration of the Act as a whole, a uniform and consistent answer is required. See:  
 Dunsmuir 
  at paragraphs 50, 60, and 122.
