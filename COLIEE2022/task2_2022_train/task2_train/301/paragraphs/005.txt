Before proceeding to my conclusions I wish to refer to some principles which have guided me in dealing with this matter. First, the appellant urged me to treat the matter as completely de novo without regard to the Chairman's decisions. While I accept that these appeals involve determinations of fact which I am as entitled as a Registrar to make, in my view the court should be reluctant to reverse the finding of the Registrar or Chairman unless it is clearly satisfied that he came to the wrong conclusion on the facts or unless there is significant new evidence placed before the court that was not before the Registrar. Secondly, the onus is on an applicant for registration of a trademark to satisfy the Registrar, or on appeal the court, that there is little likelihood of confusion between his proposed trademark and the registered trademark of a party filing an opposition. Thirdly, it should be kept in mind that this is not an action for infringement of the respondent's registered trademarks nor is it an action for the expungement from the register of the respondent's trademarks: that is, the validity of the respondent's trademarks are not in issue and there is no onus on the respondent to demonstrate that its trademarks are not confusing with the trademarks of third parties not before this court.
