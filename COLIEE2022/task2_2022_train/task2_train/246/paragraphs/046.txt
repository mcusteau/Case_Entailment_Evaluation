The difficulty with the
McLachlan
interpretation is that it suggests that an officer has discretion. It requires an officer to look at an applicant's circumstances and determine whether or not special circumstances exist which warrant awarding the applicant full points notwithstanding that he or she does not meet the years of study specified. This approach appears to be directly contrary to the clear wording of s. 78(4), which states that when an applicant has the credential but not the years of study "the skilled worker
shall
be awarded" the points as is provided in the subsection. There does not appear to be any scope for the exercise of discretion or the consideration of any "special circumstance" other than the lack of study years.
