In
Xu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2010 FC 418, I held that whether or not there is a duty to give reasons, that duty is satisfied when, in circumstances where an applicant has not raised any specific factor indicating that the points awarded would not be a sufficient indication of the likelihood that the applicant would become established in Canada, the officer may simply state that he or she is satisfied that the points are a sufficient indicator of the likelihood of establishment. This is the case here.
