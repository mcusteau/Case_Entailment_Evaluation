The officer awarded Mr. Marr 15 points for his educational credentials; Mr. Marr says that he ought to have been awarded the 20 points provided for in s. 78(2)(d)(i) as he had a two-year post-secondary educational credential and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies because:
a. in addition to the 13 years of other education he had a three year apprenticeship period; or
b. if the apprenticeship period were not considered, then s. 78(4) of the
Regulations
applied to credit him with the same number of points as is set out in s. 78(2)(d)(i).
