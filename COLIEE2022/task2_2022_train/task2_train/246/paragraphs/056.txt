Despite Justice Mainville's finding in
Medina
, I am of the view that in this case the Court should review the reconsideration request determination given that it is essentially part of the same decision. The respondent acknowledged that the Court has jurisdiction to do so if satisfied that the interests of justice demanded it. The June 29, 2010 letter has the same immigration file number, refers to the same decision, and was issued before Mr. Marr filed his application for judicial review on August 5, 2010. No useful purpose is served in requiring this application to be bifurcated into two separate proceedings. In the circumstances, it would be contrary to the interests of justice and the effective administration of justice to insist that Mr. Marr file a separate application and seek leave to judicially review the decision to refuse reconsideration of a decision already under review.
