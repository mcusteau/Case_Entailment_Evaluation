[44]
This leaves us with the analysis of the subsection provided by Justice Mandamin in
McLachlan
. Justice Heneghan adroitly summarized the
McLachlan
interpretation at para. 23 of her reasons in
Thomasz
:
In
McLachlan
, this Court held that subsection 78(4) is engaged where an individual has attained an academic credential but not the specified years of study. If adequate special circumstances exist the applicant should be awarded the number of points corresponding to the academic credential attained, notwithstanding that the applicant has not completed the specified years of study. The application was allowed due to the officer's failure to consider the special circumstances of that case.
