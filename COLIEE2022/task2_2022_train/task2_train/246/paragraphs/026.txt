In reply, Mr. Marr submits that the Court in
Khan
and
Kabir
distinguished
McLachlan
on the basis that the applicant had not put forward any special circumstances to consider. However, he submits that in
McLachlan
the only special circumstance was the fact that the applicant had achieved the relevant educational credential in a shorter period of time, and that therefore the basis for distinguishing
McLachlan
in
Kabir
and
Khan
is not reasonable. He further submits that the interpretation in
McLachlan
should be preferred given that it would not make sense to have a "special circumstances" provision in s. 78(4) if it were merely to affirm the provisions in s. 78(2).
