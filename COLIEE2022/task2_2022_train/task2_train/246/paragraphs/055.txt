[55]
The cases cited by the respondent,
Bodine
and
George
, do not address the question at issue here.
Bodine
and
George
involved situations where the applicant was attempting to bring before the Court evidence that was not before the decision-maker. Here, the evidence of the apprenticeship was before the decision-maker, and the issue is whether the decision-maker, not the Court, was able to consider the information.
