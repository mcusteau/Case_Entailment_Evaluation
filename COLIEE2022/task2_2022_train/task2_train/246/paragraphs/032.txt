However, reading this paragraph alone, it is clear that the 20 points can only be awarded if the applicant also has 14 years of studies. It is obvious that an applicant will only have those years of education if the secondary school study period is 12 years, as it is in most of Canada. In Scotland, however, it is 11 years. Mr. Marr therefore has only 13 years of studies. He does not meet both of the requirements set out in s. 78(2)(d)(i).
