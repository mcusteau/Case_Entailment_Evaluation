It should be understood that this judgment binds the parties only, and then only in relation to the issues as they were raised in this action and settled by the terms of the judgment as agreed upon. Legally the declarations included have no effect for any other claims by other parties. This is, of course, the result of any judgment rendered, whether or not that be at the request of both parties or expressed to be on their consent, though this may not always be understood by the interested observer.
