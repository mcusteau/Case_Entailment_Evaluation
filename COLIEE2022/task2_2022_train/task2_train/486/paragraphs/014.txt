The court convened on October 27, in open court, with counsel for the parties and members of the public in attendance. Counsel advised me formally that issues between the parties had been settled on terms that it was agreed would not be part of the public record of the court, except for a judgment, the terms of which were agreed on between the parties and which was submitted to the court. The draft judgment as presented made no reference to consent of the parties or to their agreement to settle matters between them. I raised with counsel whether it would be appropriate to insert in the judgment reference to consent of the parties, a reference I would ordinarily include where the parties requested a judgment on agreed terms. After consultation between themselves, I was advised by each of counsel that it was appropriate the judgment be signed in the form in which it had been presented, which reflected the terms of a part of the settlement between them. I considered the matter briefly and then signed the judgment as presented, without making reference to consent of the parties.
