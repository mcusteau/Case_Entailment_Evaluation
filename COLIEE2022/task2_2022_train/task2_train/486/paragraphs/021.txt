In
Muldoon and Teitlebaum v. Canada
(1988), 21 F.T.R. 154, the applicants sought a declaration that the prohibition against voting by judges included in the
Canadian Elections Act
was of no force and effect in light of s. 3 of the
Charter
. The Deputy Attorney General on behalf of Her Majesty admitted all facts alleged and conceded that the prohibition was not defensible under s. 1 of the
Charter
and that the plaintiffs were entitled to the declaration sought. Mr. Justice Walsh granted declaratory relief sought after raising and discussing issues that, in his view, were relevant. He concluded (at p. 158, 21 F.T.R.):
"... the granting of declaratory relief is discretionary. It should not, however, lightly be refused when there is agreement between the parties that it should be granted unless the court finds that to do so, would not be justified by the facts or would constitute a miscarriage of justice. I cannot so find on the facts before me in the present case. It could well have been decided either way had there been a full contestation."
