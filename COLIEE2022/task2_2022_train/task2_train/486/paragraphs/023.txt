There are recent decisions in this court and others which deal with treatment of persons with an admitted homosexual orientation differently from others, under federal laws, in light of s. 15(1) of the
Charter
. In
Veysey v. Canada (Commissioner of the Correctional Service)
, [1990] 1 F.C. 321; 29 F.T.R. 74 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Dub√© held that refusal to accord visiting privileges to the homosexual partner of a prisoner under a Private Family Visiting Program established by a Commissioner's Directive for the Penitentiary Service was an infringement of equality rights as a result of discrimination on a ground analogous to those prohibited under s. 15(1) of the
Charter
. That refusal infringed the applicant's rights under s. 15(1) in a manner not established as permissible within s. 1 of the
Charter
. On appeal the relief granted, certiorari and mandamus, was upheld and the appeal dismissed, on other grounds. In its reasons the Court of Appeal noted that counsel for the appellant had formally advised that the Attorney General of Canada took the position that sexual orientation is a ground covered by s. 15 of the
Charter
, an admission not made before the trial judge. (
