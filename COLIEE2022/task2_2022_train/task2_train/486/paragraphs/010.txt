This review of the facts I draw from the pleadings. In the statement of claim filed in the action the plaintiff claimed general damages, punitive or exemplary damages and declaratory relief. Three declarations were sought, first, that the plaintiff's rights as provided in the
Charter
and in particular, s. 2(b) and (d), and ss. 15(1) and 7 have been denied by the defendant; secondly, that the defendant's policies and practices with respect to homosexuality and homosexuals in the Canadian Armed Forces are contrary to the
Charter
; and thirdly, that the defendant is to adopt and carry out policies and practices which do not discriminate against homosexuals in the Canadian Armed Forces.
