Section 225.2(2) of the
Act
is, as noted, the statutory provision under which the March 15, 1999 authorization was made. This paragraph reads as follows:
"225.2(2)
Authorization to proceed forthwith.
Notwithstanding s. 225.1, where, on ex parte application by the Minister, a judge is satisfied
that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the collection of all or any part of an amount assessed in respect of a taxpayer would be jeopardized by a delay in the collection of that amount
, the judge shall, on such terms as the judge considers reasonable in the circumstances, authorize the Minister to take forthwith any of the actions described in ss. 225.1(1)(a) to (g) with respect to the amount." (emphasis mine)
