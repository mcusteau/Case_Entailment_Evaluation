Taxpayer attacks paragraphs 29 and 31 of Ms. Daz√©'s March 12, 1999 affidavit in support of the ex parte authorization. Taxpayer says "even a summary investigation would have revealed that the assets of the Petitioner have been depreciate [sic] to well below their cost. Revenue Canada has prior year's returns for the Petitioner and could have looked at the depreciation claim ... In fact, in the context of my review of the Roberge affidavit, it will become clear that Revenue Canada has done no serious investigation of the Petitioner's tax liability or capacity to pay but has acted precipitously to seize an amount without justification".
