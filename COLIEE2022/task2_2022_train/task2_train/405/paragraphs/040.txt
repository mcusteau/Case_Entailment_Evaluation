Taxpayer says Revenue Canada got it wrong when it added $538,660 to its income; there was no undeclared income earned by the taxpayer in 1995 because:
(1) In terms of compensation for past services in the form of 75,000 shares pursuant to paragraph 3(1)(d) of the Services Agreement, these shares were not issued until after 1996, were subject to a one-year hold according to
S.E.C.
Regulations
and had no value during the hold period or after the year had expired;
(2) Revenue Canada failed to reduce the remuneration received by the taxpayer by the amount of GST and PST applicable to the payments; and
(3) The balance of income was reported in accordance to its receipt by Services MLM or Fidutech who provided services under the Services Agreement from time to time.
