As noted, Mr. Roberge also filed a reply affidavit on behalf of the respondent which, in part, touched upon some of the "other issues". Mr. Roberge said that Mr. Mareng√®re met with his accountant (Mr. Pontbriand) on February 9th which was the day before the reply deadline indicated in his letter of January 19, 1999. Mr. Roberge notes that it was not until March 10, 1999, at the end of the day, that Mr. Pontbriand left him, for the first time, a voice mail message asking for an extension of time and he notes that, at that date, the notices of reassessment and the 1998 assessment had been issued.
