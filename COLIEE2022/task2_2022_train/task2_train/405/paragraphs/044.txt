Revenue Canada, in its reply affidavits, reiterates the taxpayer's faulty basis in reporting income; notes again that Fidutech only filed its 1996 return (due March 31, 1997) on March 24, 1999. Revenue Canada again points to the Settlement Agreement as evidence that all of the services performed under the Services Agreement to the Dominion Bridge Group were rendered by Services MLM In addition, Revenue Canada says it has not been shown that GST and PST were paid and, in any event, it is improper for Fidutech to attribute to itself income belonging to Services MLM.
