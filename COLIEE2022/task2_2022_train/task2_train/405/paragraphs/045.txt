Taxpayer says Revenue Canada got it wrong again in adding undeclared income for this taxation year, the main form of which are represented by 1995 and 1996 bonuses paid in January 1997 as well as 1997 bonus. Taxpayer says these bonuses are not subject to GST and PST. The 1995 and 1996 bonuses were paid to and were declared by a non-registrant (Groupe Fiducorp Inc.) which also provided services under the Services Agreement. In terms of the 1997 bonus, this amount is to be reported on a timely basis in the taxpayer's 1998 fiscal year because this bonus was approved only after the end of the taxpayer's 1997 fiscal year.
