Taxpayer admits having a tax balance owing of $21,688 as at January 11, 1999. Mr. Marengère says "if Mme Dazé had any concern for the truth, she would have learned that the Petitioner had already made arrangements for payment of the balance and that Revenue Canada has cashed a cheque dated February 15, 1999 for $7,500 and held a cheque dated March 15, 1999 for $7,775 and a cheque dated April 15, 1999 for $8,000". Mme Dazé, in her affidavit, admits this is true but says:
(1) These cheques were sent to Revenue Canada without any communication and were only registered in Revenue Canada's computer system since February 18, 1999;
(2) The first cheque was dated February 15, 1999;
(3) Taxpayer is in default making instalment payments for each of the taxation years at issue.
