Revenue Canada answers these allegations in much the same way as in respect to previous taxation years, namely, wrong basis for reporting (cash versus earned basis), the filing by Fiducorp of its 1997 tax return only on March 24, 1999, non-demonstration by the taxpayer that it paid GST and PST on its base compensation and the Settlement Agreement relating to the performance of all services by the taxpayer. In addition, Revenue Canada adds that Fiducorp's income declaration is $53,246 less than the authorized bonuses for 1995 and 1996. In terms of the 1997 bonus, Revenue Canada states it has not been shown that this bonus was not authorized until after the end of the taxation year. Moreover, Revenue Canada adds that corporate documents provide for minimum annual bonuses each year of 50% of the base compensation.
