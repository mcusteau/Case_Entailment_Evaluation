Revenue Canada responds to Mr. Marengère by pointing out that what was contemplated in the Credit Agreement did not happen because there was no loan from Wellgate to Dominion Bridge Corporation in the amount of U.S. $4.8 million a fact which was admitted by Mr. Marengère in cross-examination on his affidavit in these proceedings. Revenue Canada adds that the payment of the settlement proceeds took the form of a promissory note issued by DBC to Wellgate (pursuant to an assignment executed by Mr. Marengère and Services L.M.L. to Wellgate) payable in October of 1999 which, because of the acceleration provision, became payable when Cedar Canada and some of its members filed proposals or went into bankruptcy under the
BIA
. Moreover, Revenue Canada points out that Mr. Marengère himself acknowledged in paragraph 45 of his affidavit in these proceedings that Wellgate "will receive the funds in part as assignee for the beneficial owners thereof, that is myself and the Petitioner to the extent of $2.7 million U.S." adding in that same paragraph "the fact that sums are payable to Wellgate International Inc. and that Wellgate International Inc. is an offshore company is of no great relevance" because it was a "matter of public record notably from S.E.C. filings made on a timely basis since August 1997 that Wellgate has been in existence and has been involved in the financing of the Dominion Bridge Group".
