Nor is the interpretation of the plaintiff as to when "filing" is achieved supported by the other provisions of the
Act
which pertain to the filing of documents. These provisions clearly indicate that "filing" of a document is only achieved once it is physically received and "filed" by the Registry of the Federal Court. This conclusion is perhaps supported most strongly by rule 200(5) which provides:
"200(5) Where there is a requirement or authority for filing a document in the Registry or the Court, the document may be so filed by
depositing it in
the office of the Registry
in Ottawa or in one of the local offices; ...
A document may be deposited in any of the aforesaid offices by being sent there by mail, but shall in no case be regarded as having been deposited until it physically reaches the office
." (Emphasis added)
