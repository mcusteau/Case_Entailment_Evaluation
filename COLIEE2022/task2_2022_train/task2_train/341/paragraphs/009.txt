On the first point, the plaintiff submits that proper "filing" of the statement of claim was effective on January 24, 1997, the date on which it was sent by registered mail to the Federal Court Registry. According to the plaintiff, filing by registered mail is expressly permitted by s. 48(2) of the
Federal Court Act
, which states that an "originating document may be filed ... by being forwarded ... by registered mail ... to the Registry". This provision, the plaintiff states, does not provide that filing requires physical receipt by the Registry. In this manner, the plaintiff suggests, s. 48(2) is analogous to provisions of the
Income Tax Act
which permit the effective date of filing a return to be the date upon which it is mailed, not when received.
