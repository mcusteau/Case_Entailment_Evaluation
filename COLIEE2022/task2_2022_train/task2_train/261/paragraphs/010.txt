The ongoing equitable jurisdiction outlined above must be contrasted with the adjudicative function bestowed on the earlier Immigration Appeal Board, and now the C.R.D.D., to recognize refugees by determining whether a well-founded fear of persecution based on Convention grounds exists. It is in the latter circumstance that the doctrine of "functus officio" applies. Addressing the issue of the power of the Immigration Appeal Board to reopen the hearing of an application for redetermination of a refugee claim after the Board had rendered its decision under ss. 70 and 71 of the
Immigration Act
, S.C. 1976-77, c. 52 (the "
1976 Act
"), Mr. Justice Marceau stated the following in
Nabiye
(at p. 426):
"The basic idea, I think, is that a tribunal exercising adjudicative powers may not re-try a matter after it has disposed of that matter in accordance with the
Act
, unless it is expressly authorized to do so by its enabling legislation. This is the well-known principle of 'functus officio'. However, we should not forget the conditions for its application. The principle applies first to the exercise of an adjudicative power, which explains the
Grillas
exception ...; and it then implies, at least in its formulation, that the tribunal rendered a decision in accordance with the
Act
, which undoubtedly is the reasoning behind
Gill
, as the court thought that a decision rendered contrary to the rules of natural justice could be treated by the tribunal as if it were not a decision."
