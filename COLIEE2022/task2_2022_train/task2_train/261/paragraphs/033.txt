Therefore, in circumstances where a claimant is effectively denied his or her right, during a hearing, to make a free, informed and independent decision regarding a claim to refugee status and to obtain counsel, fundamental justice is denied. In
Kaur v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1989), 104 N.R. 50; 10 Imm. L.R.(2d) 1 (F.C.A.), the claimant's denial of fundamental justice stemmed from her inability to freely obtain counsel and to choose how she would present her case due to threats uttered by her ex-husband on the night before her hearing before an immigration adjudicator. In
Mattia v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1987] 3 F.C. 492; 10 F.T.R. 170 (T.D.), the claimant's inability stemmed from mental illness prior to and during the proceedings. In both of these cases, however, the denial of fundamental justice resulted from circumstances that tainted the original hearing, and not from circumstances that arose subsequent to the proceedings, as in the present one.
