Similarly, in
Penelakut Indian Band v. Charlie et al.
(Action No. T-183-93, January 24, 1994) (T.D.) [see (1994), 73 F.T.R. 150], it was clear that Mr. Justice Rouleau considered the tribunal's original decision to be a nullity, as the adjudicator had yet to make a determination on the merits, and because the adjudicator had misapprehended the applicant band's interest in the proceedings and consequent failure to submit evidence. The case of
Reekie v. Messervey et al.
, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 219; 104 N.R. 387, may be distinguished from the present case in the sense that the change in the law which the applicant sought to have recognized and enforced had occurred prior to the Supreme Court's decision to deny leave to appeal.
