Strictly speaking, the captioned statement of Mr. Justice Sopinka was obiter dictum as he went on to hold that the Board conducted a valid hearing until it came to dispose of the matter, but that, in rendering a decision that it had no jurisdiction to make, it failed to make its disposition on a proper basis. Mr. Justice Sopinka ordered that the Board be permitted to reopen the hearing to make a proper disposition and, in order to allow the parties an opportunity to properly address the issue of what recommendations should be made, new evidence and submissions could be made. In that sense, the proceedings of the Board could be viewed as incomplete, as the final step of disposing of the matter had been rendered a nullity.
