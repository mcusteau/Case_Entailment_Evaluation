Finally, I note that in the example, cited by Mr. Justice Sopinka in
Chandler
, where a less rigid application of "functus" would be warranted, specifically that of s. 15 of the
1966 Act
, it made perfect sense to allow rehearings at any time, given that the function bestowed upon the Immigration Appeal Board was equitable and continuous in nature, as opposed to adjudicative, as is the case with the C.R.D.D. (see
Grillas
, supra)
