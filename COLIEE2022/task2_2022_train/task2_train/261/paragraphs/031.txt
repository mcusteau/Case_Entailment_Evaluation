There is no doubt, in the aftermath of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in
Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177; 58 N.R. 1; 17 D.L.R.(4th) 422; 14 C.R.R. 13; 12 Admin. L.R. 137 (S.C.C.), (cited hereinafter to S.C.R.), that Convention refugee claimants are within the scope of protection of s. 7 of the
Charter
and that the deportation of such claimants infringes their right to security of the person. What is at issue in the case at bar is, in the first place, whether applying the doctrine of "functus officio" to deny the applicants the opportunity to submit evidence of changed country conditions in Pakistan once proceedings have ended violates their s. 7 rights and, if so, what remedies are available to them, given that they did not challenge the constitutionality of the
Act
or the
Rules
at the motion to reopen their hearing and given my holding under question #1, that the C.R.D.D. did not have jurisdiction to reopen the applicants' refugee proceedings to hear new evidence. In my opinion, the second issue need not be addressed, as the doctrine of "functus officio", as applied to the applicants in the present case, does not violate their s. 7 rights.
