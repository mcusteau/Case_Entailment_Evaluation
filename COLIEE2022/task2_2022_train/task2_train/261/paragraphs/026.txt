In the first place, s. 69.1(9) of the
Act
defines the jurisdiction of the C.R.D.D. as that of determining whether a claimant is a Convention refugee, rendering a decision as soon as possible after completion of the hearing, and sending written notice of the decision to the claimant and to the Minister. Section 46.01(1)(c)(i) of the
Act
makes it clear that once a claimant has been
determined
by the C.R.D.D., the Federal Court or the Supreme Court not to be a Convention refugee or to have abandoned the claim, that person, until he or she leaves Canada, is no longer eligible to have their claim determined by the C.R.D.D. Clearly, to allow what in effect would be multiple determinations of refugee status, would defeat the purpose of s. 46.01(1)(c)(i).
