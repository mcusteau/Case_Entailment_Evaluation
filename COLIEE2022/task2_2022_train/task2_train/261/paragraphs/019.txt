Chandler
involved a decision by the Practice Review Board of Alberta Association of Architects (the "Board"), on its own initiative, to undertake a review of the practice of the Chandler Kennedy Architectural Group (the "Group") and its members after the Group filed for voluntary insolvency. After hearings were held, the Board issued fines and suspensions for unprofessional conduct against the Group and some of its members. An application for an order in the nature of certiorari to quash the Board's decision was heard and granted by the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench and was ultimately upheld by the Alberta Court of Appeal. According to Prowse, J.A., the Board exceeded its jurisdiction to make findings and orders relating to disciplinary matters, as such powers were vested in the Complaint Review Committee (the "Committee"). The Board was empowered merely to report to the Council of the Alberta Association of Architects (the "Council") and to make recommendations that it felt were appropriate.
