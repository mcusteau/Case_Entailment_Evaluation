The applicants are citizens of Pakistan who belong to the Ahmadi faith. The applicants sought to be recognized as Convention refugees in Canada by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution based on their religion and membership in a particular social group. Their hearing before the C.R.D.D. was held on November 1, 1991 and, in a decision dated January 29, 1992, the C.R.D.D. determined the applicants not to be Convention refugees. Subsequent to the date on which the C.R.D.D. rendered its decision, on October 30, 1992, the applicants filed an application with the C.R.D.D. to reopen their claims. In support of this application, evidence, which was not available to the C.R.D.D. at the time it rendered its decision, was submitted. The evidence was intended to document a change in country conditions since the hearing and the decision; specifically, the evidence pointed to an increase in incidents of persecution against Ahmadis in Pakistan.
