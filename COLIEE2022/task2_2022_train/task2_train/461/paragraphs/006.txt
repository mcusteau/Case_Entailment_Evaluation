The
Chen
decision was recently applied in
Huang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2008] F.C.J. No. 164, 2008 FC 132 (
Huang
) and in
Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
), [2008] F.C.J. No. 338 (QL), 2008 FC 266 (
Li
). These three decisions, although not identical to the present case, are somewhat analogous with regards to the alleged perverse reasoning and capricious character of the impugned decision. In the case at bar, the essence of the whole reasoning of the Board to deny the applicant's claim is expressed in the following passage: "In summary, I find that the claimant is not, nor has ever been, a Falun Gong practitioner in the People's Republic of China, due to her ability to leave the country without incident". Nowhere in the impugned decision has the Board analysed the evidence pertaining to the Falun Gong activities of the applicant in China or in Canada except to suggest that "[a] ny knowledge that the claimant has learned about Falun Gong could easily have been acquired here in Canada in order to manufacture this claim".
