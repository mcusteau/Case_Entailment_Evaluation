  On the other hand, it should be noted that the standard of proof that an immigration officer must apply in the context of sections 34 to 37 of the  
 IRPA 
  is that of "reasonable grounds to believe" that the facts stated in those sections have occurred, are occurring or may occur ( 
 IRPA 
 , s 33). It is settled law that this standard requires more than mere suspicion but is not equivalent to the balance of probabilities required in civil matters:  
 Mugesera v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 SCC 40 at para 114, [2005] 2 SCR 100;  
 Charkaoui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 SCC 9 at para 39, [2007] 1 SCR 350. Accordingly, the role of this Court when reviewing an immigration officer's inadmissibility decision is not to determine whether, in fact, there were reasonable grounds to believe that the individual engaged in or was a member of an organization that engaged in the alleged acts but to consider whether the officer's finding that there were reasonable grounds to believe can itself be regarded as reasonable.
