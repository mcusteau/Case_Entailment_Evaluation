  It should be noted that the redacted passages include only a few lines at pages 24 to 27 of the tribunal record, which contains 1861 pages. A good part of the deleted content deals with information of an internal or administrative nature that is irrelevant for the purposes of this application for judicial review. With respect to the more substantive portion of the redacted information, whose disclosure would be injurious to national security or endanger the safety of other persons, it is not likely to prejudice the applicant insofar as it deals with information that he already knows or that was already communicated to him.
