  As appears from the interview notes, the applicant did not ask to see this document. However, the applicant was confronted on several occasions with the testimony he gave to the CSIS officer, and it can be assumed that the applicant knew what he said at that interview. According to the jurisprudence of this Court, it is not necessary to give the applicant the document itself that the decision-maker can rely on as long as the information contained in that document has been disclosed to the applicant so that he can know the case against to him or her and correct prejudicial misunderstandings or misstatements:  
 Nadarasa v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 1112 at para 25 (available on CanLII);  
 Krishnamoorthy v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 1342 at para 25, 400 FTR 267. In this case, I am of the opinion that the non-disclosure of the CSIS report did not prevent the applicant from arguing his position, and he had ample opportunity to respond to the concerns expressed in the report.
