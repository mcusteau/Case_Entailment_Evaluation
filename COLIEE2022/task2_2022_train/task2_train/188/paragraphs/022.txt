  In some circumstances, the failure of a Citizenship Judge to fully inquire into the scope of the absences as well as a breach by an applicant for Canadian citizenship of accurate disclosure of his presence or absence in Canada may well be sufficient in and of itself, to overturn a Citizenship Judge's decision. Issues of materiality and intent on the part of the applicant would come into play. In the case before me, I am not prepared, on this ground alone, to allow the appeal. I agree with counsel for the respondent that, looking at the total absences of Mr. Jreige from Canada, the discrepancy error is not material in the respondent's overall absences. Moreover, on the evidence, I am satisfied that the respondent made an honest mistake in calculation.
