  The type of case before the court is a familiar one. A business person, engaged in international commerce, becomes a permanent resident of Canada and lands with his spouse and children; an apartment is rented and shortly thereafter the business person leaves on several overseas trips after obtaining social insurance registration, etc. The spouse and children remain in Canada. The overseas trips are frequent and lengthy. In some circumstances, a Canadian company is incorporated to provide the corporate vehicle for the overseas business activities.
