With respect to the statements in paragraph 10, the solicitor had written a letter, on May 6, 1997, to the Buffalo office on her client's behalf, with respect to the position of the visa officer that her client had to prove that he held liquid assets of a certain amount before he could be issued a visa. She explained, on his behalf, that he had assets that were not liquid but which he planned to liquidate if approval of his application was given. In addition, the visa officer's notes of the interview of the applicant on May 16, 1997, show that the applicant did tell the visa officer that he had at least one asset (one-half of an apartment in Moscow) that he planned to liquidate (whether he could as a practical matter do so in another matter), and that he had not sought employment in Russia recently because he was hoping to immigrate to Canada.
