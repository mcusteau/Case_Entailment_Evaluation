With perhaps one or two exceptions, the statements the solicitor makes are matters within her personal knowledge. Certainly, this is true of her knowledge of the applicant's proficiency in English. Her position, as solicitor for the applicant, would also result in her having first hand knowledge of a number of matters, for example, the number of times he had been called for an interview, the identity of his former counsel. Also, given her broader experience, her assertion that hostile and discriminatory practices exist is probably more reliable than such an assertion by her client. I should not be taken as accepting that statement as accurate but merely that it is not inadmissible because of lack of personal knowledge by the affiant. It is a statement of opinion, by someone who appears to have the requisite experience to give that opinion - whether it is supportable by relevant facts is, of course, a matter for the judge weighing the evidence on the merits to decide.
