  When an applicant submits documentary evidence to the decision-maker, he or she may expect that the latter will accept it in its entirety or only in part, or reject it outright. As the decision-maker, it is the panel's function here to select and use the parts of the evidence which it considers most persuasive as a basis for its conclusions. If subsequently, as in the case at bar, this choice does not suit the applicant because it is harmful to his case, that is not a valid ground for reviewing the decision.
