  After considering and commenting on the main points in the evidence and noting the applicant's contradictions between his statements in the Personal Information Form (PIF), his testimony to the immigration officer, his testimony at the hearing and the documentary evidence, the panel found his account to be neither credible nor consistent with the documentary evidence. Consequently, it did not accept the applicant's allegations that sending him back to the country of origin would subject him to substantial present and personal risk of torture or a threat to his life and so dismissed his application.
