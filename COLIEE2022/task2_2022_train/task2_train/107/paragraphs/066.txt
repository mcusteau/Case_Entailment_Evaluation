  On a close reading of the Director's decision, I am unable to agree that she applied the wrong test in her assessment. I recognize that, in articulating her decision, she did not explicitly refer to the established test of "unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate, hardship." However, she explicitly addressed and assessed the factors that are typically evaluated in H&C applications, namely, the extent to which Mr. Katwaru has become established in Canada; his family and other social ties in Canada; the interests of his child relatives (he doesn't have any children of his own); and the impact that being deported would have on him and his family. In addition, she explicitly acknowledged the "hardship" that Mr. Katwaru's wife would likely suffer, emotionally, physically and financially, should she be parted from Mr. Katwaru. She also explicitly acknowledged the "hardship of a permanent separation from family members," which he would face if deported from Canada.
