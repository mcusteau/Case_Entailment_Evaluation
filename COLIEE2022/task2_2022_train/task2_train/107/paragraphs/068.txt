  Regarding the personalized risks identified by Mr. Katwaru, the Director concluded that there was not "sufficient evidence that Mr. Katwaru would face any personalized risks if he returned to Guyana, based on being a criminal deportee, because of the media coverage of his criminal case in Guyana, or at the hands of his ex-wife's family." Once again, in my view, this is simply another way of stating that these personalized risks would not likely present  
 any 
  hardship for Mr. Katwaru.
