  Mr. Katwaru asserts that the Director was given discretion in this manner, and discretion would not have been given if there were not circumstances in which it can be exercised positively, despite the existence of criminality. Relying on  
 Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 155; [1999] F.C.J. No. 380 Â (T.D.), at paras. 11-16, and  
 Lau v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1984] 1 F.C. 434; 52 N.R. 63 (F.C.A.), he submits that to base a decision solely on his prior criminality, to the exclusion of all other factors, is to give undue influence to that single factor and thereby commit a reviewable error.
