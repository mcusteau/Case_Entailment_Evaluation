  In my view, this observation did not materially impact on the Director's conclusion that the generalized risks identified by Mr. Katwaru would represent more than serious inconveniences. As reflected in the observations made by the Director in the same paragraph in which she made her concluding statement on generalized risks, that conclusion was reached based on (i) the fact that there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate that those risks would directly impact upon Mr. Katwaru; and (ii) the evidence that Mr. Katwaru and his family members have made trips back to Guyana, thereby suggesting that they felt that conditions in Guyana are not as risky as he suggested in his H&C application.
