  In summary, I am satisfied that the various conclusions, findings and observations made by the Director and alleged to have been unreasonable by Mr. Katwaru were not, individually, or collectively, unreasonable. As previously noted, I am satisfied that the decision reached by the Director was well within the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , above, at para. 47). For the reasons I have explained, that decision also was transparent, intelligible and appropriately justified.
