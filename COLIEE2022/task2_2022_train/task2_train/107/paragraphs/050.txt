  Mr. Katwaru acknowledges the seriousness of the offence. However, he notes that the offence occurred over 14 years ago, that he has served his sentence, that he has rehabilitated himself, that he is unlikely to re-offend, that he has close ties in Canada, and that he is a productive member of society. He submits that if his application is to be refused, he is entitled to an explanation as to why it should be refused, other than the mere existence of the offence.
