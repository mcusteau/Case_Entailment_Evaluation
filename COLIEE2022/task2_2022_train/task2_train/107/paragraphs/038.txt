 [38] 
  The two-prong test applicable to a motion for an order of confidentiality pursuant to Rule 151 of the  
 Rules 
  was established by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance) et al. 
 , [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522; 287 N.R. 203; 2002 SCC 41, at 543-545. There, the Supreme Court stated that confidentiality orders under Rule 151 should only be granted when: 
 
 
 
 "(i) such an order is necessary in order to prevent a serious risk to an important interest, including a commercial interest, in the context of litigation because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and 
 
 
 
 "(ii) the salutary effects of the confidentiality order, including the effects on the right of civil litigants to a fair trial, outweigh its deleterious effects, including the effects on the right to free expression, which in this context includes the public interest in open and accessible court proceedings." 
 
 
 
 With respect to the first prong of the test, the Supreme Court added that: 
 
 
 
 "(i) the risk in question must be real and substantial, in that the risk is well grounded in the evidence, and poses a serious threat to the commercial interest in question; 
 
 
 
 "(ii) in order to qualify as an 'important commercial interest', the interest in question cannot merely be specific to the party requesting the order; the interest must be one which can be expressed in terms of a public interest in maintaining confidentiality; and 
 
 
 
 "(iii) the Court must consider not only whether reasonable alternatives to a confidentiality order are available, but must also restrict the order as much as is reasonably possible while preserving the commercial interest in question."
