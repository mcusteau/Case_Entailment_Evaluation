  The  
 Establishment 
  section of the H&C decision exposes a second material error linked to the factual error which warrants redetermination as found above. The Visa Officer makes the statement that "there has been no information provided by the applicants with regard to the situation in Kenya with respect to these children or why they did not accompany their parents to Canada" to ground the pivotal assumption that "these children have established themselves in Kenya and were reluctant, or viewed it unnecessary to come to Canada". The assumption is sheer speculation. It is clear that the speculation formed a central part of the negative decision rendered. Indeed, there is evidence on the record which refutes the speculative opinion and which, by the exclusive evidentiary analysis undertaken, was apparently not known or neglected. In his PIF, the father says about the children in Kenya: 
 
 
 
 I am still crying for my other two kids back home who I was unable to rescue because they were in boarding high schools (that served as their refugee/hiding places) and had not attained certificates to allow them to get admission and student visas to escape out of the country.
