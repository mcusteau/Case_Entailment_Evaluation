  With respect to the  
 Establishment 
  section of the decision under review, in my opinion, a critical reviewable error is exposed. As I expressed during the course of the hearing of the present Application, a critical error of fact is, on its own, enough to find that the decision is made in reviewable error. The critical error of fact is the statement that the parents have "three children who continue to reside in Kenya". In fact, at the date of the decision, the "children" were 27, 23, and 20 years of age and the eldest was resident in Dallas, Texas (H&C Tribunal Record, p. 101). This error is important because it mischaracterizes the supposed hardship relieving family well being in Kenya.
