  At the Refugee Protection Division level, the joint protection claim of each member of the family was dismissed on the finding that state protection would be available to them on their return to Kenya. The Visa Officer found that, because the Applicant failed to produce new evidence to warrant a review of the state protection issue, there is no risk to the Applicant should he return to Kenya. I find no reviewable error in this determination. From the material filed by the Applicant in the present Application, and from what he submitted in argument as an unrepresented litigant during the course of the hearing of the Application, it is clear that the Applicant's present concern is that new evidence exists regarding risk to him in Kenya which post-dates the PRRA decision. As a result, I understand that the Applicant intends to pursue making a further PRRA application for himself and the members of his family.
