 It is obvious that, in reaching the decision on the H&C application the Visa Officer did not consider the entirety of the evidence the applicants supplied on the issue of risk. While some of this evidence is contained in the material filed on the PRRA application, I do not think it can be reasonably argued that they should be required to present the same material on each discrete application when they are inextricably linked. Indeed, since the Visa Officer was charged with rendering both decisions, this is absolutely unnecessary. In this kind of situation, surely some accommodation should be made to not let the form interfere with the substance. It is important to note that the Visa Officer did view the PRRA and H&C applications as inextricably linked, because the analysis of risk in the H&C decision is taken directly from the body of the PRRA decision.
