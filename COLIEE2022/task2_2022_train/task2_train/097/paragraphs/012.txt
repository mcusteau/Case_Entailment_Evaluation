  It is obvious that when a visa officer is charged with making both a PRRA and an H&C determination, the totality of the evidence offered by an applicant on both issues is relevant to both determinations. This is true because the possible repercussions of the return of an applicant to his or her country of origin are an important factor in giving both risk and humanitarian and compassionate relief from the return. At the practical level, a visa officer is required to have a full knowledge of all the evidence tendered on both issues, and factual findings across both applications must be based on knowledge of the complete record.
