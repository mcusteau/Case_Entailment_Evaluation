  The applicant had a full opportunity to make representations and submit evidence to support these allegations. However, the onus which the applicant bears, was simply not met. In his reasons, the officer states that: 
 
 
 
 In my letter dated 09/12/03, I asked the applicants to submit evidence of their submission that there is no education in Korea for women, no graduation for those in Korea who have completed some of their education outside of Korea and no career opportunities for women in Korea. In the submission dated 12/01/04, the applicants' counsel states that Ye Jin, Su Jin and Han Na would have to pass admission exams to enter university or college in Korea and states they feel it would be impossible for them to pass the exams as they have been away from the Korean education system for seven years. While I acknowledge their belief that they may be unable to pass university or college admission exams in Korea due to their absence from the Korean education system, I note that it is based on speculation and not on fact. [...] Insufficient evidence has been presented by the applicants to satisfy me that education and employment opportunities would not be available to Ye Jin, Su Jin and Han Na in Korea.
