In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham
, [2004] 3 F.C. 572; [2004] 3 F.C. 572; 315 N.R. 91; 2004 FCA 4, the Federal Court of Appeal pointed out that, strictly speaking, a detention review is not de novo. On the contrary, all existing factors relating to custody must be taken into consideration, including the reasons for previous detention orders:
"[6] I think it is important to first clarify the use of the term de novo. Strictly speaking, a de novo review is a review in which an entirely fresh record is developed and no regard at all is had to a prior decision (see
Bayside Drive-in Ltd. v. M.N.R.
(1997), 218 N.R. 150 at 156 (F.C.A.);
Molson Breweries v. John Labatt Ltd.
, [2000] 3 F.C. 145 at 166 (C.A.)). This is not what occurs in a detention review. In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Lai
, [2001] 3 F.C. 326 at 334 (T.D.), Campbell, J., held that in a detention review, 'all existing factors relating to custody must be taken into consideration, including the reasons for previous detention orders being made.' Although Campbell, J., was dealing with the former
Act
, there is no reason why this ruling should not apply to the new
Act
. Therefore, de novo review is not a precisely accurate way of describing the kind of review hearing held under sections 57 and 58 of the new
Act
."
