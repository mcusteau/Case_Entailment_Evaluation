  The issues in this case are the following: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the Board err by reversing the onus? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Board err by imposing on itself evidentiary fetters? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the Board err by misstating the evidence? 
 
 
 
 4. Did the Board err in giving the Minister's evidence no weight? 
 
 
 
 5. Was the Board's assessment of the evidence perverse and patently unreasonable?
