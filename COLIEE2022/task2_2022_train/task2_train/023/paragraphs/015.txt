  The Board refers only to subsection 4(3) of the former  
 Regulations 
 . Section 4 of  
 IRPA 
  Â sets out a test that is different from the one in subsection 4(3). The analysis according to the Applicant's Memorandum of Argument was based on subsection 4(3) as a result of the time-frame in which the matter was set. The following analysis is also based on subsection 4(3) because that is consistent with the conclusions of the Board.
