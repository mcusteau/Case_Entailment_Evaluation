  Here, there was no finding of past persecution and it is implicit in the decision that, notwithstanding that the RPD believed Mrs. Brovina, it did not accept that she had been subject to past persecution. On the contrary, it noted that very few Albanians qualify as refugees because of political involvement. The leadership roles and the high level positions held by Mrs. Brovina's son and daughter-in-law in the Democratic Party constituted the reason for allowing their claims. Mrs. Brovina, on the other hand, was never politically active. She was, unfortunately, in her son's apartment when it was ransacked and she, again unfortunately, happened to answer the telephone. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the perpetrators were interested in her. In the absence of a finding of past persecution, subs. 108(4) has no application.
