The defendant, McArthur Thompson, has conceded that subsequent to the execution of the Anton Piller order, it has deleted from its computers copies of unlicensed software despite the existence of a court order prohibiting that conduct. In this situation, if the Anton Piller order is set aside and the plaintiffs no longer have access to the materials discovered on the execution of that order, the plaintiffs will be left without evidence to prove at least some of the infringement for which the defendant McArthur Thompson may be liable.
