[35]
There are three essential conditions for the making of the type of order which the court has made in this case. These conditions were established by Lord Ormrod, L.J., in the case of
Piller (Anton) K.G. v. Manufacturing Processes
, [1976] Ch. 55 (C.A.) and confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Nintendo of America Inc. v. Coinex Video Games Inc. et al.
, [1983] 2 F.C. 189; 46 N.R. 311 (F.C.A.):
"First, there must be an extremely strong prima facie case. Secondly, the damage, potential or actual, must be very serious for the applicant. Thirdly, there must be clear evidence that the defendants have in their possession incriminating documents or things, and there is a real possibility that they may destroy such material before any application inter partes can be made."
