The Anton Piller order required the defendants to permit representatives of the plaintiffs to enter and search their business premises at 1300 Hollis and 1310 Hollis for any unauthorized copies of the plaintiffs' computer programs and any items and records that, on reasonable grounds, concerned the infringement of the plaintiffs' copyrights. To obtain the order, the plaintiffs relied on an affidavit sworn by Andrew G. Younger dated December 9, 1997, as well as other affidavits.
