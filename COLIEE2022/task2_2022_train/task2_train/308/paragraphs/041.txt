The present matter differs from the situation in the
Nintendo
case, regarding the nature of the business of the infringer. In that case, the infringers were involved in the manufacturing and distribution of unauthorized copies of videogames, and represented a "fly-by-night" operation. The moving party in this proceeding does not fall in that class and it was not alleged that it did.
