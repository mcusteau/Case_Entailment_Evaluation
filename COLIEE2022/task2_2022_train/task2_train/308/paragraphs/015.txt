On January 7, 1998, representatives of the plaintiffs attended at 1300 Hollis and 1310 Hollis and executed the order. They searched for documents which might concern infringement of the plaintiffs' copyrights. They left the originals of all such documents, and took away photocopies only. As well, those representatives ran a computer audit program on each of the computers found in the defendants' premises. That computer audit program, called GASP Audit, prepares a record of computer programs found on each computer, which is stored on a floppy disk. The floppy disks containing the search data were removed by the search team. The computers of the defendants were left, after the search, in the condition they had been in before the search commenced.
