  If Mr. Fineberg's version of events is true, perhaps he may have a direct recourse against his accountant; however, this aspect of the claim is separate from CRA's involvement ( 
 Babin v. Canada (Customs Revenue Agency) 
 , [2005] 4 C.T.C. 1, 2005 FC 1195 at paragraph 21). In this regard, the evidence considered by the decision-maker reveals that Mr. Fineberg had already been contacted by the fiscal authorities in 2002 and 2005 about missing tax returns. The tax returns were eventually filed more than two years after the last time CRA requested compliance with the law. Despite such requests, Mr. Fineberg apparently did not even make a single step to mandate another accountant.
