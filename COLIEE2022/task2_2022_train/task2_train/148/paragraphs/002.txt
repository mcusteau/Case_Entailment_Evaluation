  On November 29, 2007, the applicant's initial fairness request was allowed in part, and it was granted partial relief from late filing penalties for the taxation years of 1999 and 2000 and the arrears interest and installment interest for the period from November 10, 1999 to December 31, 2001. The applicant invoked death and sickness of its administrators during the relevant period to sustain its request for relief. On November 21, 1997, its then president Polly Namerow passed away. Approximately one year later, Mrs. Charlotte Fineberg succeeded as president of the applicant. Suffering from a brain tumor, she died on March 10, 2001. She was replaced by Mr. Fineberg on January 7, 2002. Meanwhile, Mr. Fineberg underwent surgery to be implanted a Pacemaker. Furthermore, as "a practicing dentist who had been away from the financial details of the company", Mr. Fineberg, as new president invoked finding it "most difficult to arrange and receive reliable professional accounting services." Accordingly, "the sickness of Mrs. Charlotte Fineberg and Dr. Irwin Fineberg" was stated as basis for the partial relief. Nonetheless, the balance of interest and penalties remained payable.
