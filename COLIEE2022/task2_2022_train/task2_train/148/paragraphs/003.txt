  It is the applicant's second fairness request that underlies the decision at issue in this application. To support its second level application, the applicant made several of the same arguments found in its initial fairness request but additionally invoked third-party delay resulting from the "accountants, in possession of the company's prior financial detail [being] the party exclusively qualified to file its tax returns". Moreover, the penalties and interests due were said to "[constitute] yet another hardship so severe as to be considered both excessive and unfair". It appears that no further evidence was presented in support of the second application. Consequently, by letter dated May 8, 2008, a Minister's delegate, Mr. Gilles Lavergne, refused to provide additional relief from interest and penalties to the applicant, stating that "the corporation [had] not exercised a reasonable amount of care in conducting affairs and [had] not acted quickly to remedy any delay or omission. Under the self-assessment system of taxation, the responsibility for filling a return of income on or before the filing due date rests with the corporation." The applicant now contests Mr. Lavergne's decision.
