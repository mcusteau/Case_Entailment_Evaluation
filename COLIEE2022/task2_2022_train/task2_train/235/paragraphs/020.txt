In this case, the record shows that the applicant did request an assessment under the occupational heading of "assistant manager, retail". Further, the applicant's immigration consultant, in his letters to the High Commission, dated January 25, 1996 and August 9, 1996, also proposed an assessment of the applicant's qualifications as an "assistant manager, retail". That was the occupational classification for which he was assessed. I do not find that the visa officer failed in her duty to assess alternate occupations inherent in the applicant's work experience, for there is no evidence that the officer failed to consider the applicant's whole work experience or to give him an opportunity to submit evidence of his qualifications. On the contrary, the officer's description of the interview in both her affidavit and from her notes suggests that she spent some time questioning the applicant on his bookkeeping skills, a point the applicant himself makes in his submissions regarding the visa officer's assessment of his personal suitability. It is also notable that in her notes, the visa officer does indicate, in rejecting the applicant, that "He does not otherwise have an occupation for which there is a demand in Canada." Similarly, in her letter of August 6, 1996 to the applicant, she wrote that "There is no other occupation apparent on your application in which you are qualified and experienced, and under which your application would be successful." I take "apparent on your application" in this context to include the information from the interview as well as the written material submitted by the applicant.
