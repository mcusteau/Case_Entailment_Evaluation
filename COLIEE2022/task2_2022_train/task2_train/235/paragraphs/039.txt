The appellant submits that the officer's comment on the applicant's failure to take further studies was drawn from notes of another visa officer located in Delhi, made in regard to an earlier application for a visa by the applicant. The applicant argues that in seeking to render her processing of the applicant's application consistent with that of the earlier assessment in Delhi, the officer fettered her discretion. Because she made this decision before the interview with the applicant, it is said she violated the principle that "she who hears must decide". Finally, the officer's reliance on the New Delhi officer's notes precluded the assessment of personal suitability with reference only to the interview, as required by Schedule I, Factor 9 which provides that "Units of assessment shall be awarded on the basis of an interview with the person ...". It is urged that there was an improper delegation of authority.
