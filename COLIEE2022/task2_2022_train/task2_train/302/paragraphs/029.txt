In the circumstances of this case, the visa officer's "local knowledge" constitutes an extraneous factor that she relied upon in arriving at her determination. There was no other evidence before the visa officer upon which she could arrive at the determination that the applicant's reporting to the General Manager was indicative of the applicant's years of service with his employer, rather than his degree of responsibility. Moreover, the applicant was unaware that the visa officer was relying, in part, on this local knowledge in determining his application for permanent residence in Canada. Fairness required that the visa officer disclose this information to the applicant so that he had an opportunity to respond to it.
