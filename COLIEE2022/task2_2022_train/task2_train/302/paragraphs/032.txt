Mr. Rotenburg is correct in maintaining that, if the visa officer had considered under items 3 or 4 (experience and occupational factors) the fact that the applicant had worked for only one employer, or in only one type of business, the visa officer would have erred, because the "limited" nature of an applicant's experience is simply not identified there as a relevant consideration. However, it would seem to me potentially relevant under item 9 (personal suitability), in that it may limit the applicant's adaptability in the Canadian labour market. Since it is not clear under which item the visa officer considered it, I am not satisfied that she committed an error by having regard under Schedule I of the
Regulations
to the limited nature of the applicant's experience.
