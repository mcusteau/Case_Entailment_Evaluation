Mr. Rotenberg did not contend that this practice, which the visa officer followed in this case, rendered the refusal erroneous in law. However, it might be helpful to applicants if visa officers advise them of this practice. According to counsel for the applicant in this case, for example, Mr. Hussain was quite taken aback when he discovered that he had only been assessed in the occupation of Secretary. In a written response, dated April 8th, 1997, to a faxed letter from the applicant's immigration consultant requesting that the visa officer consider the applicant as an Executive Secretary and not as a Secretary, the visa officer stated that the applicant "was interviewed at this office and assessed as secretary based on information obtained and available to us at interview. He was notified of his refusal accordingly." The visa officer's letter to the applicant of March, 16th, 1997 however was the first time the applicant received notification that he had been assessed only in the occupation of secretary.
