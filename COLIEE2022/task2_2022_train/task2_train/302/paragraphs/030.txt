Mr. Rotenburg also submitted that the visa officer erred by taking too narrow a view of the description to
CCDO
4111-111 of an Executive Secretary as someone who, inter alia, "[a]cts on routine matters affecting [the] day to day operation of organization, in employer's absence." The visa officer had regard only to whether the applicant had the authority to sign documents when the General Manager was away, and when the applicant told her that he did not, she apparently inferred
from this alone
that he did not act on routine matters in the absence of his employer. I agree that this was a legal error by the visa officer. Signing one's own name to a document is surely only one indication of the authority to act on routine matters, and the visa officer ought not to have made it the sole basis for her conclusion.
