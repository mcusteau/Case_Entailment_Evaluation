In the case at bar, the key issue was whether the applicant was able to qualify under the heading of Executive Secretary as opposed to Secretary. This determination is very fact-specific, and in this case clearly called for more than a general question to enable the visa officer to make an adequate assessment of the information that the applicant had provided. This kind of open-ended invitation at the end of an interview cannot make good the officer's failure to have engaged more deeply with the material before her by asking questions, or by disclosing to the applicant the precise nature of her concerns with the application.
