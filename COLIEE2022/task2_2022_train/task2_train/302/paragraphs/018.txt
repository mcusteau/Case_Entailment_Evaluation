There would seem to be three differences between these occupations that are relevant to the present case. First, the "lead statement" of
CCDO
4111-111 states that an executive secretary performs "secretarial and
administrative
duties for
office executive
" (emphasis mine).
CCDO
4111-110, on the other hand, does not specify the person for whom secretarial services are performed and, in describing the nature of the work done by a secretary, refers to "clerical work and
minor
administrative and business
details
" (emphasis mine). Second, as part of his or her duties, an executive secretary "researches and compiles information for [the] employer," whereas a secretary "types statistical reports." Third, an executive secretary "[a]cts on routine matters affecting day to day operations of organization, in employer's absence." There is nothing analogous to this in the description of the duties of a secretary.
