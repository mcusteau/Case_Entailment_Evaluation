This rationale does somewhat miss the point of the Applicant's claim that a warning was intended by the SSP. However, the actual words used during the attack, as related by the Applicant, are as consistent with a warning as an intention to kill on that occasion. Teaching a lesson can be done by death or a beating and a warning. What the Board doesn't address, however, was the Applicant's clear testimony that the attack was interrupted and that this was why he wasn't killed. Also, the Board's findings on this issue, rather than being based upon any internal inconsistency in the Applicant's testimony, are nothing more than the Board's own musings about what it thought ought to have happened. These are thin and unsafe grounds for a negative finding on this point. However, once again, this finding has to be examined in context of the Decision as a whole and the other reasons stated by the Board for its negative credibility finding.
