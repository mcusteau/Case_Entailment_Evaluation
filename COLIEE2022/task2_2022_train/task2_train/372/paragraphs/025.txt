The Respondent says that a review of the reasons demonstrates the unfoundedness of the Applicant's argument that the Board did not consider his explanations for failing to claim at the earliest opportunity, and in the United States at all. The Board considered his claim of ignorance of the situation in the United States but found it implausible. The Board decided that a person truly fearful for his/her safety would have investigated the situation in the United States prior to going there. In this case, the Applicant had friends in the United States and his father was in communication with them as early as 2 days before he left Pakistan.
