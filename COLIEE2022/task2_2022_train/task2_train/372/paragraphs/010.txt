The Board based its negative findings on implausibilities of the kind that MacGuigan J.A. warned against in Giron:
The Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board chose to base its finding of lack of credibility here for the most part, not on internal contradictions, inconsistencies and evasion, which is the heartland of triers of fact, but rather on the implausibility of the claimant's account in light of extrinsic criteria such as rationality, common sense and judicial knowledge, all of which involve the drawing of inferences, which triers of fact are in little, if any, better position than others to draw.
