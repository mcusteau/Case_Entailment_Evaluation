As stated by Thurlow, C.J. in Brar v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1986] F.C.J. 346 (C.A.):
In our opinion, the points argued by counsel for the Applicant raise only questions of credibility and of the weight of evidence and afford no legal basis upon which this Court could properly interfere with the decision of the Immigration Appeal Board.
