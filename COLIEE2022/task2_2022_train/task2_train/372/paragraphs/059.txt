What troubles me here is that so much of the Decision rests upon negative plausibility findings and negative inferences: failure to make a claim in the U.S.; implausible target for the SSP; failure of the SSP to kill the Applicant when they had the chance. None of these findings have much of a base to them. They are not based upon inconsistencies internal to the Applicant's evidence but upon the Board's own view of what someone in the position of the Applicant and his family should have done, or upon what the Board thought would have been a more likely outcome in the circumstances. When it comes to making decisions based upon these kind of criteria, the Board is no better placed than the Court. Also, inferences and conclusions are drawn by the Board without really addressing strong evidence that points the other way (e.g. the fact that the October, 2001 attack was interrupted). The one place where the Decision appears to identify a strong inconsistency - the discrepancy between the March 21, 2001 attack and the Applicant's joining the TNFJ at an earlier date - doesn't really amount to much when the precipitating event was the October, 2001 attack which happened after the Applicant joined the TNFJ.
