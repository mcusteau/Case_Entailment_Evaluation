Moreover, the Applicant's credibility was not enhanced by his delay in making a claim in Canada, or by his failure to claim in the United States. His credibility was also undermined by his claim that he did not investigate the situation in the United States for refugee claimants before he left Pakistan, despite having friends there and the fact that his father had been in communication with them as recently as two days before the Applicant left. The Board expected people who fear for their safety to flee at the earliest opportunity and to seek protection as soon as they are beyond the reach of their persecutors. Hence the Board felt there was no subjective or objective basis to the claim and the Applicant had not demonstrated any risk concerning his return to Pakistan.
