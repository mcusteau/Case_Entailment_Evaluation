On March 21, 2001, the Applicant says that at 11:30 at night, he and his brother were beaten by five SSP soldiers. The Applicant says that he was targeted because he was an active member of the TNFJ. After this beating, he continued to engage in activities with the TNFJ, such as distributing pamphlets to rally the attendance of Shia in the community to religious ceremonies. The Applicant says that as a result of these activities he was targeted by the Sepah Sehaba ("SSP"), a militant organization, and on October 22, 2001, he was attacked by four masked and armed men driving motorcycles. These men said that they must teach this "infidel Shia Hazara boy" a lesson for being against the SSP. The Applicant says that he was hit in the head with the butt of a pistol, beaten and kicked and then saved by an approaching car that saved the Applicant's attackers, who left stating that, next time, he would be killed.
