The Applicant says he also explained in his hearing that he was targeted more than executive members of the TNFJ due to the fact that he was very visible, active and young. He says he was a threat to the Sipah-e-Sahaba who eliminate youths of his profile before they grow older and more active in their religion. The Applicant testified that most of the activities he performed on behalf of his Imam Bargah took place outdoors. He was, therefore, highly visible in the eyes of the Sipah-e-Sahaba who may have also suspected that he had an important role in his religious community. All of this makes the Board's implausibility finding with respect to the persecution suffered by the Applicant, as opposed to the executive members of the TNFJ, unreasonable and based on mere assumptions for which there was no evidence.
