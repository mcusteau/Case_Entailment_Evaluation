In El-Naem v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 185 (T.D.) at pages 6 and 7, the Applicant points out that this Court determined that the CRDD erred when it drew a negative inference from an applicant's failure to make a refugee claim in Greece, where he had sojourned for one year prior to his arrival in Canada. The Court made the following remarks about unreasonable inferences:
He testified that he had no money and that he stayed in Greece to accumulate sufficient money to come to Canada. He testified that he had heard that refugee protection in Greece was problematic and that he feared deportation to Syria if he exposed his illegal status and tested refugee protection here...
. . . . .
The explanation provided by the Applicant, considering all of his circumstances, was not an unreasonable one. It is too heavy a burden to place on a young person, impecunious and on his own, in a strange land with strange customs and language, and without family support, to assume he would inevitably act in a manner that reasonable persons, secure in Canada, might regard as the only rational manner.
. . . . .
I conclude that the Tribunal erred in a reviewable manner in determining that the Applicant's refugee claim could not succeed by reason of inferences drawn from his sojourn in Greece.
