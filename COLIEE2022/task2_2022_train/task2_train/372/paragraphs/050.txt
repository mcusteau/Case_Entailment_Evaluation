The Board's reasoning on this issue was as follows:
I find this implausible. If these four attackers wanted to kill the claimant, they had the opportunity to do so in this incident. The claimant was hospitalized for two hours. Following this incident, the claimant, after discussions with his father, decided to leave the country. I find the claimant's accounting of these events lacking in plausibility and do not believe the events occurred.
