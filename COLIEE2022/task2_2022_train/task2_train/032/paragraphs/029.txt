 [29] 
  The words of Lord Denning and these final words of the court in  
 Dion 
  make logical sense. Applying a burden of balance of probabilities requires a weighing of evidence or a series of findings. Where one side bears the burden, the result of this measurement of the evidence must be that the scale upon which the weighing is done tips in favour of the party bearing the burden. In this case, with respect to the use of TIMBER CREEK BY WRANGLER for clothing, the balance favoured the Applicant and the Registrar concludes that the Respondent's marks were not confusing with the Respondent's trademark and tradename.
