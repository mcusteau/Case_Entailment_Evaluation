  Justice Iacobucci cautioned that the reasons should be taken as a whole and that a reviewing court should not seize on one or more mistakes or elements of the decision which do not affect the decision as a whole (para. 56). In my view, it follows that, where certain elements are critical or determinative to the decision, the absence of a reasonable line of analysis in respect of those essential elements may cause a decision as a whole to be unreasonable.
