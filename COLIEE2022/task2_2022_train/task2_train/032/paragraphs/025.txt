  The Applicant submits that these words demonstrate that the Registrar applied a more onerous burden on the Applicant than the one applicable in an opposition hearing. The Applicant relies on  
 Dion 
 , at para. 10, where the Federal Court of Appeal states that: 
 
 
 
 "In my view, the Registrar erred in applying a 'still in doubt' standard, thereby imposing a burden on the applicant which is more onerous than the one applicable in civil proceedings."
