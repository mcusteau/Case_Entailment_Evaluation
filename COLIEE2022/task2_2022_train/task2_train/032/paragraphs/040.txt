 [40] 
  This argument as to the manner in which the evidence was weighed by the Registrar cannot succeed. On the standard of reasonableness, it is not up to this Court to re-weigh the evidence or substitute its views for that of the decision maker. The Registrar concluded that the failure of the Applicant to establish its mark in the marketplace was critical evidence. I am not prepared to intervene and conclude otherwise.
