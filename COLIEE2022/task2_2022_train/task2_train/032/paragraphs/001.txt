 Snider, J. 
 : The Applicant, Wrangler Apparel Corp., filed two applications on August 11, 1995: No. 751,769 for the registration of trademark TIMBER CREEK BY WRANGLER for use in association with casual clothing, and No. 789,948 for the same trademark for use in association with footwear, based on proposed use. The Respondent, The Timberland Company, opposed the application by way of a Statement of Opposition dated September 3, 1996. In a decision dated March 5, 2004, Hearing Officer Martin of the Registrar of Trademarks office (the "Registrar") granted the application for registration of the trademark for use with clothing, but refused registration of the mark for use with footwear on the ground that the proposed mark was confusing with the Respondent's TIMBERLAND trademark.
