  Applying the same reasoning to the facts of this case, I am of the opinion that the PRRA Officer made a reviewable error by concluding that state protection was available to the applicant without considering all of the evidence, including the contradictory evidence relating to the treatment of Roma. The contradictory evidence should have been weighed against the other evidence.
