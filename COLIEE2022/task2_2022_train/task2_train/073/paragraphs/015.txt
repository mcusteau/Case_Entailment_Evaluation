 [15] 
  The issues as framed by the applicant are: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the PRRA officer make patently unreasonable findings of fact and misstate the evidence? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the PRRA officer misunderstand basic refugee law and misunderstand and misapply the test for determining the availability of state protection? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the PRRA officer ignore evidence before her and selectively quote evidence which supported her position while failing to refer to evidence before her that corroborated the applicant's claim?
