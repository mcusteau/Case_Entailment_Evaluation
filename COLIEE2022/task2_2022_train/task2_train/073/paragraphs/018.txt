  The applicant submits that the PRRA Officer misstated the applicant's evidence. In her reasons, the PRRA Officer stated: 
 
 
 
 "The applicant states, "they sprayed me with pepperspray, pushed their way into my home, threatened me . . . they told me not to report it to the police . . ."." 
 
 
 
 In the applicant's narrative appended to his PRRA application, he indicated why he did not report this matter to the police: 
 
 
 
 ". . . They sprayed me with pepper spray and pushed their way into my home. They threatened me again. They told me that if they ever saw me in the neighbourhood again I would die like my whore of a grand mother died. They said that they knew the way to make this a Gypsy free zone. They also told me not to go and report it to the police because there were cops among their group. I believed it because there were reports of police corruption by the media. There were also reports of instances of police brutality against Roma. The intruders beat me. They kicked me. They only stopped when I told them that I would leave the country. I decided to come back to Canada."
