  On issues of procedural fairness, the standard of review is correctness (see

Previous cases of this court have determined that the level of fairness in cases dealing with the denial or revocation of security clearance should be limited to the right to know the facts alleged against the applicant and the right to make representations about those facts, without any guarantee of a right to a hearing.
