 [12] 
  There was some issue raised by the applicant during the hearing that he was not aware that he was required to provide more detailed answers to the letter of March 13, 2012. I have difficulty accepting this submission inasmuch as the letter specifically requested additional information concerning the very numerous and detailed incidents mentioned therein, including any surrounding or extenuating circumstances. Moreover, during oral argument there was no indication given that the applicant could add any further information of consequence to his response in his reply letter beyond that he knew nothing about the situation because he was not involved in the incidents in question.
