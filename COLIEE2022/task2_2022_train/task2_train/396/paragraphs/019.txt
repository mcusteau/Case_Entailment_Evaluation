I am satisfied that although there may be no need to impose formal guidelines on the respondent regarding what constitutes a danger to the public, that phrase must have some meaning in itself; it must constitute more than mere duplication of the conviction for a serious offence element of the legislative scheme. I am satisfied that Parliament did not intend for danger opinions to have no meaning, and that in order for the respondent to form an opinion pursuant to s. 70(5), the fact of a conviction alone is an insufficient basis; the circumstances of each case must, over and above the conviction, indicate a danger to the public. By this, I do not wish to be taken as indicating that there is no instance where a danger opinion pursuant to s. 70(5) could be properly issued where a person has only one conviction; I simply find that there must be circumstances in the case additional to a single conviction that indicate a danger to the public. There may very well be cases where the circumstances surrounding a single conviction point to a danger to the public.
