Counsel for the respondent submitted that this court should review opinions of the respondent with regard to danger to the public with great deference, in light of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Nguyen v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 151 N.R. 69; 18 Imm. L.R.(2d) 165 (F.C.A.). That decision related to s. 46.01(1) of the
Act
, another provision that contemplates "danger opinions", in relation to persons whose right to have their claim to Convention refugee status adjudicated is taken away by the combination of a danger opinion and criminal inadmissibility to Canada. In that decision, Marceau, J.A., found:
"... it is argued that the absence of legislative safeguards to protect against the issuance of an ill-advised certificate, such as a requirement that dangerous conduct be likely to continue and that the dangerousness be intractable, coupled with the fact that there is no provision for a court review of the Minister's opinion, renders the whole legislative scheme disrespectful to principles of fundamental justice. I disagree. I do not believe that the Minister needs to be compelled to follow formal guidelines as to the factors he should take into account in forming his opinion, and I consider the Minister's opinion in respect of public danger as reliable as that of a court."
Counsel for the respondent asserted that in light of this statement, and the fact that s. 70(5) also deals with danger opinions, much deference was owed to the decision under review.
