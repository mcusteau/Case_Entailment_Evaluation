In January 1991, the applicant was charged with sexual interference under s. 151 of the
Criminal Code of Canada
, [see footnote 1] and was convicted on 2 March 1992 and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years less a day, to be followed by a two year period of probation. An appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal was dismissed. (18 November 1993) File No. C13474 (Ont. C.A.) per Grange, J.A.) The offence involved sexual intercourse with a thirteen year old neighbour of the applicant's, who had sought the assistance of the applicant and his wife when she was having difficulty with her home situation. In his sentencing reasons, Beaulieu, P.C.J., characterized the offence as follows:
"It is a case of seduction and manipulation on the part of the accused and it is a situation of the accused using his position as an adult in such a manner that he was able to seduce and take advantage of a young victim who until that stage in terms of the sexual desire referred to in the one case in particular - that situation and those interests were on the facts of this case virtually foreign to her before the accused's entry upon the scene.
"On the positive side with respect to the accused, I have taken into consideration that this is not a case of
loco parentis. It is not a situation in which there was the use of alcohol or drugs to numb the sense of appreciation of the victim. There was no overt violence or violence or threats. There was, as I have indicated, not
loco parentis nor indeed a situation of a person being in a position of trust as is normally understood."
The applicant was released on parole supervision on 29 June 1994. Under a condition of his release, he was examined at the Royal Ottawa Hospital for tendencies toward paedophilia; the result showed the applicant to have a "low level of arousal" in all areas.
