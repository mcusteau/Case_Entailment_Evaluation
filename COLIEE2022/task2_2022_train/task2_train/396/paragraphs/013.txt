I am satisfied that the decision in
Nguyen
, stating as it did that a decision by the Minister as to public danger was "as reliable as that of a court", was not intended to limit the jurisdiction of this court to review such an opinion, but was a confirmation of the constitutionality of a legislative scheme without formal guidelines for the respondent to consider. I am satisfied that it was also meant as an endorsement of the discretionary nature of such an opinion. I do not read the decision in
Nguyen
as impinging on the authority of this court to grant relief where it is satisfied that the respondent, acting pursuant to a danger opinion provision, has committed one or more of the classes of error enumerated in s. 18.1(4) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended.
