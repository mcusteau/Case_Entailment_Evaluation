In the recent case of
Bahadori v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1995), 95 F.T.R. 75 (T.D.), which I brought to the attention of counsel, my colleague Wetston, J., reviewed a danger opinion formed in the context of s. 53 of the
Act
. Regarding the meaning to be attached to that danger provision, which is identical in wording to the danger provision in s. 70(5), he found:
"Whether a person constitutes a danger to the public is fact dependent. Do the facts support the finding that that person indeed constitutes a danger to the public in Canada? It is not simply a question of whether the opinion is subjective or objective. It is more a question of whether the facts support a finding that, in law, that person constitutes a danger to the public in Canada.
. . . . .
"It is the court's opinion that what is essential under this section is a determination of whether the facts support the finding that Mr. Bahadori poses
a present or future danger
to the public in Canada." (underlining added by me for emphasis)
Neither counsel viewed this decision as inconsistent with his client's position. I view the decision as indicative of the meaning to be ascribed to "danger to the public", that is, that there be a "present or future danger" to the public, a concept consistent with a conclusion that the facts of any particular case must disclose more than a single conviction in the past to support a danger opinion.
