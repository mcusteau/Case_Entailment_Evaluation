Because of these charges, the applicant left Pakistan on September 6, 1997 for Canada. She arrived in Canada with a visa to study at York University, but just over a month later, she left for the United States where she lived from October 18, 1997 until July 28, 2002. At that time she returned to Canada to claim refugee protection and stated that, on account of her imputed political opinion and because she was a woman in Pakistan, she feared returning to her country as the charges against her might lead to a death sentence. She also fears her uncles who are members of the PML and whom she says would receive support from the military government and the army in having her condemned to death.
