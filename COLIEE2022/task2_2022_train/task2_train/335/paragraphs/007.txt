This Court has established, on numerous occasions, namely in R.K.L. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 162 (F.C.T.D.) (QL) at para. 7, that the determination of an applicant's credibility is at the core of the tribunal's jurisdiction. Furthermore, this Court has found that the tribunal has well-established expertise in the determination of questions of fact, particularly in the evaluation of the credibility and the subjective fear of persecution of an applicant: see Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1800 (F.C.T.D.) (QL) at para. 38; and Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (1998), 157 F.T.R. 35 (F.C.T.D.) (QL) at para. 14. It is also up to the tribunal to use its discretion to evaluate if the applicant's account is plausible and to make an adverse finding of credibility on that basis (Aguebor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 732 (C.A.) (QL).
