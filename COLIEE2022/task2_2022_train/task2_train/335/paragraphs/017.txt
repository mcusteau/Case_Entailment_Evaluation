In the present case, the tribunal gave no credibility whatsoever to the applicant's story. The applicant's story was judged to be not credible because it contained numerous contradictions. These contradictions were not minor or peripherical inconsistencies. For example, the tribunal noted that section 507 of the Pakistani Code of Criminal Procedure did not correspond at all with the charges laid in the First Information Report. Also, the tribunal noted that the applicant's lawyer did not provide a reasonable explanation for this inconsistency. Furthermore, the tribunal considered other evidence in evaluating the applicant's credibility. The tribunal stated that, according to the Montreal Regional Binder dated October 2002, documents such as those presented by the applicant were almost always false. Accordingly, the documents submitted as evidence by the applicant were given no weight by the tribunal. The applicant has failed to establish that those findings are patently unreasonable.
