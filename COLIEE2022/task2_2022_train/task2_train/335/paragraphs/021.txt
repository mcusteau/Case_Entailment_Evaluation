In addition, the applicant states that she has been wrongfully treated by the tribunal to the point that a breach of natural justice has occurred. With all due respect and after an extensive reading of the transcripts from the hearing, this Court does not believe that a breach of natural justice occurred. In fact, the applicant had every opportunity to explain her side of the story and to respond to the tribunal's questions. Furthermore, the tribunal was very patient with the applicant during the hearing. In fact, even though the applicant had a problem that prevented her from speaking normally, and even though the applicant had some trouble expressing herself and understanding the questions posed to her, the tribunal took the time to repeat each question to the applicant when she did not understand or when she simply did not respond in an appropriate manner. As for the question relating to the health of the applicant's mother, the tribunal only asked the applicant to be more precise in her answers because it was having difficulty understanding her testimony and, ultimately, because it wanted to be able to better evaluate her credibility. Basically, there is no evidence supporting the allegation of a breach of natural justice. Anyhow, even if a breach of natural justice occurred, the applicant raised no objection at the hearing. This failure to object at the hearing amounts to an implied waiver of any breach that might have occurred: Yassine v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 949 (F.C.A.) (QL).
