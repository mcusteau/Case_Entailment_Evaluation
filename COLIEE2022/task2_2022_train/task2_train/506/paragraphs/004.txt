Additionally, the stated basis for the motion is that the question of the scale of costs "should have specifically been dealt with but was not" (rule 397(1)(b)). There are two reasons why this submission fails. First, rule 400 does not require the court to specifically refer to a particular scale when awarding costs. Since costs were awarded in the order, it cannot be said that the issue of costs was overlooked or accidentally omitted. Second, by virtue of rule 407, column III of the table to Tariff B is the ordinary scale. Thus, my order did specify the scale. Even if I were persuaded that Astra and Takeda are correct that the scale must be specified, and I am not, rule 397(1)(b), which requires that a matter that should have been dealt with has been overlooked or accidentally omitted, does not apply.
