Layden-Stevenson, J.
: This motion arises out of my judgment dated December 11, 2003 [see 243 F.T.R. 6], wherein I granted the applicants' application for an order prohibiting the Minister of Health from issuing a notice of compliance (NOC) to Genpharm with respect to its 10 mg and 20 mg omeprazole capsules until after expiration of the four patents that were in issue. With respect to costs, I ordered as follows:
"Astra and Takeda are entitled to their costs throughout against Genpharm, such costs to be taxed on the ordinary scale. No costs will be awarded for or against the Minister."
