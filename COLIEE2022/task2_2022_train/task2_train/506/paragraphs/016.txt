It is true that intellectual property cases frequently present complex facts and give rise to difficult issues. However, general tariffs are set and there is no provision that patent cases should be accorded a treatment different from other types of cases:
Stiga Aktiebolag and Noma Outdoor Products Inc. v. S.L.M. Canada Inc.
(1991), 43 F.T.R. 221; 34 C.P.R.(3d) 258 (T.D.);
Reliance Electric Industrial Co. v. Northern Telecom Ltd.
(1990), 30 C.P.R.(3d) 469 (T.D.). In
Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser
(2002), 19 C.P.R.(4th) 524 (T.D.), affd. (2002), 22 C.P.R.(4th) 455 (F.C.A.), Mr. Justice MacKay addressed the issue of awarding higher than normal party-and-party costs, as represented in Tariff B by column III, in the context of a patent infringement action. He concluded that, in relation to the high volume of work and the greater expenses involved, the costs reflecting those consequences should not be expected to be borne by the defendants. They are an aspect of overall business expenses. The fact that some inventions may be inherently more expensive to defend than others is a factor that should not be reflected in a higher than normal level of party-and-party costs.
