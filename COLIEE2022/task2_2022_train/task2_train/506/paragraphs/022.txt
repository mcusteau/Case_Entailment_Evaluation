There are additional requests for directions regarding specific items of the Tariff, specifically item 14(b), item 24, and a number of requests for item 27. I concur with the comments of Mr. Justice DÃ©cary, writing for a unanimous court, in
Wihksne v. Canada (Attorney General)
(2002), 299 N.R. 211 (F.C.A.) when he stated that, absent special considerations, a factual determination of costs is better left in the hands of specialized taxing officers. All of the items requested under item 27 should be left to the assessment officer. I will address the requests with respect to item 14(b) and item 24 because, in the absence of directions from the court, the assessment officer does not have authority to deal with them.
