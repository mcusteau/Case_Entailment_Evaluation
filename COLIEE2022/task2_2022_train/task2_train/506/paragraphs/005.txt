In its notice of application, Astra requested "costs". In Part IV of the Memoranda of Fact and Law, both Astra and Takeda requested "costs". The hearing of the application was set for five days and was completed in four and one half. Neither counsel for Astra nor counsel for Takeda addressed the issue of costs. Neither requested an opportunity to address costs either orally or by way of written submissions. Absent any indication from the parties that they were seeking costs other than on the normal basis - party and party costs in accordance with column III of the table to Tariff B - I awarded costs on the ordinary scale. The primary issue now is whether rule 403 permits me to direct the assessment of costs on an increased scale. In my view, it is not open to me to provide that direction and even if it were, I would decline to do so in any event.
