Both Astra and Takeda request that directions be provided to the assessment officer to assess second counsel fees for each of them, for attendance at the hearing, under item 14(b). I am prepared to allow Astra's request. Astra carried the argument with respect to all four patents in issue. The arguments were divided between two counsel and it is both reasonable and fair to allow the second counsel fees.
