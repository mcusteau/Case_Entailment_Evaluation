  The words "Made in the USA for ... National Tobacco, Lachine, Quebec" appearing on the label affixed to the product by the respondent does not create a false impression as to the origin of the product and does not detract from the conclusion that use of the WRANGLER mark was a direct use by the respondent manufacturer. The product is imported from the United States and the phrase is a factual statement that the product is made for the Canadian distributor.
