  Section 45 is intended to be a simple, summary and expeditious procedure for cleaning up the trademark register of trademarks that have fallen into disuse. It is designed to clear the dead wood from the register, not to resolve issues in contention between competing commercial interests, which should be resolved in expungement proceedings under s. 57 [see footnote 2].
