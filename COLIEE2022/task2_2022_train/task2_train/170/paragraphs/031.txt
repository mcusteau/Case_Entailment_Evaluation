  In the leading case of  
 Manhattan Industries Inc. v. Princeton Manufacturing Ltd. 
  [see footnote 8], the trademark was HARNESS HOUSE for use in association with belts. Mr. Justice Heald stated the following: 
 
 
 
 "... s. 4 [the definition of 'use' in the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 ] contemplates the normal course of trade as beginning with the manufacturer, ending with the consumer and with a wholesaler and retailer or one of them as intermediary. When the [American trademark owner] sold to the [Canadian] retailer and the retailer sold to the public, the public came to associate applicant's mark with the HARNESS HOUSE belt; s. 4 contemplates that the use between the retailer and the public ensures to the benefit of the manufacturer and its use in Canada. In other words - if any part of the chain takes place in Canada, this is 'use' in Canada within the meaning of s. 4. If this interpretation is correct, then the sale by the retailers in Toronto and Montreal to the public of HARNESS HOUSE wares marked with the [American trademark owner's] trademark is a 'use' in Canada and it matters not whether property or possession passed to the retailer in the United States."
