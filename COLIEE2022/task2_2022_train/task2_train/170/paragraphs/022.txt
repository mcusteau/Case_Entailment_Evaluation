 [22] 
  The nature of the proceeding before this court under s. 56 of the  
 Act 
  is similar to a trial de novo in that the appellant has the right to adduce evidence which was not presented to the Registrar. The court is not restricted to deciding whether the Registrar was right or wrong. However, the court should be circumspect about interfering with a Registrar's decision [see footnote 6].
