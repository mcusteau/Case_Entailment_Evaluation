While the Board acknowledged this new evidence and admitted it into the record, it cannot be said to have accepted it in accordance with the special rules contained in s. 39 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
. In its reasons, the Board characterizes the truck accident as an "alleged incident", thus indicating doubt of its actual occurrence. In so doing, however, the Board was silent as to whether this new evidence, which purports to corroborate the applicant's claim that he was injured in 1963, was credible or reasonable. If the Board found this evidence lacking in either capacity, it should have said so and given reasons. While the Board is certainly entitled to assign minimal weight to this evidence, it must articulate reasons for so doing. Failing to do so constitutes an error in law and warrants judicial intervention.
