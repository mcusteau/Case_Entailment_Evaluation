  Pfizer alleges that Dr. Moe’s affidavit aggressively critiques Dr. Husain’s evidence. Pfizer brought a motion for (among other things) leave to file a reply affidavit of Dr. Husain pursuant to Rule 312 of the Federal Courts Rules. Pfizer alleges that the reply affidavit consists exclusively of responses to Dr. Moe’s criticisms. By Order dated June 16, 2006, Prothonotary Tabib declined to grant Pfizer leave to file Dr. Husain’s reply affidavit. Pfizer presently brings a motion requesting that the Court set aside the Prothonotary’s Order and grant it leave to file the reply affidavit.
