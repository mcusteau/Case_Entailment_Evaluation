  The confusion as to the test to grant leave to file reply evidence arises out of attempts to determine the reach of paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Federal Court of Appeal’s Atlantic Engraving decision. I reproduce the paragraphs below: 
 
 
 
 ¶ 8 Pursuant to rule 306 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998, an applicant has thirty days from the filing of its notice of application to file its supporting affidavits and exhibits (appeals under section 56 of the Trade-marks Act fall within Part 5 of the Rules entitled "Applications" (rules 300 to 334) and therefore must be commenced by way of a notice of application). By exception, rule 312 allows a party, with leave of the Court, to file additional affidavits. Under that rule, the Court may allow the filing of additional affidavits if the following requirements are met: 
 
 
 
 i) The evidence to be adduced will serve the interests of justice; 
 
 
 
 ii) The evidence will assist the Court; 
 
 
 
 iii) The evidence will not cause substantial or serious prejudice to the other side (see Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc. (1997), 76 C.P.R. (3d) 15 (T.D.); Robert Mondavi Winery v. Spagnol’s Wine & Beer Making Supplies Ltd. (2001), 10 C.P.R. (4th) 331 (T.D.)). 
 
 
 
 ¶ 9 Further, an applicant, in seeking leave to file additional material, must show that the evidence sought to be adduced was not available prior to the cross-examination of the opponent's affidavits. Rule 312 is not there to allow a party to split its case and a party must put its best case forward at the first opportunity (see Salton Appliances (1985) Corp. v. Salton Inc. (2000), 181 F.T.R. 146, 4 C.P.R. (4th) 491 (T.D.); Inverhuron & District Ratepayers Assn. v. Canada (Min. of Environment) (2000), 180 F.T.R. 314 (T.D.)).
