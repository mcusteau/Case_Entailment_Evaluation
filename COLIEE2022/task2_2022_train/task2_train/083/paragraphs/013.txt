  Apotex argues that Pfizer has failed to distinguish Atlantic Engraving. The Respondent argues that there is nothing in Atlantic Engraving suggesting that it should not apply when considering whether to allow the filing of reply evidence in PM(NOC) proceedings. Although cross-examinations have not started in the present matter, Apotex argues that the Prothonotary still found that the evidence was available to Pfizer at an earlier time, and that the interests of justice would not be served by allowing the evidence to be filed at this stage. According to Apotex, the Prothonotary did not err by importing a fourth factor into the three-part test for reply evidence. Rather, she considered the test in light of the Federal Court of Appealâ€™s decision in Atlantic Engraving.
