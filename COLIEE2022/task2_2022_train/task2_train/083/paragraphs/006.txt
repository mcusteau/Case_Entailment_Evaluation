  Pfizer contends that the Prothonotary erred by importing a fourth requirement into the test for granting leave to file reply evidence. This fourth requirement, referred to by Pfizer as the “available in chief” requirement, examines whether the evidence sought to be filed in reply was available at an earlier date. Pfizer submits that the Prothonotary erred by importing the “available in chief” requirement from Atlantic Engraving into the test to grant leave to file reply evidence in PM(NOC) proceedings. Pfizer notes that the “available in chief” requirement in Atlantic Engraving applied when a party sought leave to file reply evidence after cross-examinations had already occurred. In contrast, cross-examinations have not taken place in the present matter. Moreover, Atlantic Engraving was a trade-marks appeal, while the present matter is part of a PM(NOC) proceeding. Pfizer argues that PM(NOC) proceedings are unique, and that the issues are often only made clear to the applicant after the respondent has filed its evidence. Pfizer suggests that the Court has therefore adopted a more permissive approach to allowing reply evidence in PM(NOC) proceedings, and cites Abbott Laboratories in support of this claim.
