 [58] 
  The question of whether, in a given set of circumstances, the detention of an individual has become indefinite is a question of mixed fact and law. In this case, the answer to that question is highly dependant on the unusual facts of this case. As a consequence, I am of the view that the Board's finding in this regard is properly reviewable against the standard of patent unreasonableness. My conclusion in this regard is not, however, determinative of the issue, as I am satisfied that the Board's conclusion on this issue would also withstand scrutiny under the more exacting standard of reasonableness.
