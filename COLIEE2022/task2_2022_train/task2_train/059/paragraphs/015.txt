  In a lengthy decision, the Board reviewed the procedural history of this matter, as well as Mr. Romans' medical situation. While noting that Mr. Romans' condition has improved from time to time over the period of his detention, at the time of the hearing his condition had again deteriorated, and he had been deemed unfit to attend his detention review hearing. He was, however, represented at the hearing by counsel who had been designated as his representative for the purposes of detention reviews pursuant to the provisions of s. 167(2) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
