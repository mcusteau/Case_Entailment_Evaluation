  The parties have advised me that as a result of serious concerns with respect to public safety arising from the decision to release Mr. Romans from detention, proceedings were immediately commenced under the Ontario  
 Mental Health Act 
 . Within 48 hours of the Board's decision, Mr. Romans' detention was continued under that legislation. He still resides in the Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre, but is there now as an involuntary patient. Hisday-to-day existence has not changed at all, despite his change in status.
