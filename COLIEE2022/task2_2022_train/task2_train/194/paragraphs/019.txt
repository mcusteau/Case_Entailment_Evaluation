  In applying the approach adopted by NoÃ«l, J., in  
 Hofland v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , supra, to the facts of the present case, I am satisfied that the transcript was listed as a requirement in the competition posters in order to assist the Selection Board in assessing whether a candidate met the educational qualifications stipulated in the screening criteria. However, given the applicants' reasonable explanation for their inability to provide a transcript for their last course, the Selection Board should have conducted its assessment of their educational qualifications on the basis of other reliable documentation. The rigid adherence of the Selection Board to formality resulted in the exclusion of two qualified candidates from the competitions.
