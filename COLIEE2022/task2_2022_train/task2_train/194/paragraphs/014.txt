  Counsel for the applicants submitted, among other things, that the Appeal Board erred in failing to consider whether the Selection Board violated the merit principle by excluding the applicants, who actually met the educational requirements of the positions, from the competitions. In support of his position, counsel for the applicants relied on  
 Hofland v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (1995), 92 F.T.R. 213 (T.D.), affd. (1996), 194 N.R. 51 (F.C.A.). In that case, the competition poster for a position of word processing operator required that a copy of a "valid typing certificate" accompany the application. Although the successful candidate and the applicant submitted typing certificates with their applications, the former's certificate had expired. The Appeal Board dismissed an appeal from the Selection Board on the following basis: 
 
 
 
 "In my view, a valid typing certificate is not a legitimate requirement. The qualification required by the SOQ was: 'Typing skill in English at a speed of at least 40 wpm and not more than 5% error rate'. This was the qualification that the Board had to assess. At best, the possession of a certificate meant that the board [sic] did not have to assess whether the candidate who provided it could type. I was satisfied that the Board had assessed Mrs. Breti's typing skill and had determined that she met the requirement. I also believe that the Board would not have acted reasonably if they had excluded an applicant for this position merely because the candidate could not provide a typing certificate. After all, the assessment of qualifications is a Selection Board responsibility, not the responsibility of an outside agency."
