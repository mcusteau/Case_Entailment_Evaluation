  In conducting the screening of the candidates, the Selection Board determined that the applicants did not meet the educational requirement for the advanced financial accounting course, on the basis that they had failed to provide transcripts by the closing date of the competitions to confirm their successful completion of the course. The Selection Board was aware that both applicants had taken the advanced financial accounting course at a university, and that they had written their final examination on December 11, 1996. The applicants were unable to obtain transcripts of their marks in the course, as it takes six to eight weeks for the university to prepare such documents. In all other respects, the applicants met the screening criteria for the competitions.
