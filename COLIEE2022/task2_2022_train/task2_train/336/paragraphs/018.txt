Arrangements for B.V.'s operations in Canada, at least in part, antedate an agreement of January 1, 1976, between the plaintiff, Universal and B.V., but that agreement is the basis of its operations in the years 1978 to 1981. So far as it relates to Canada, that agreement provides that B.V. has the rights, granted by license from Universal, to distribute feature motion picture films, short subjects and trailers, that is, theatrical product of Universal, for theatrical and other exhibition, except for television and other specified uses. Further, under the same agreement B.V. also has the rights, granted by license from the plaintiff, to distribute motion picture films, television films, videotapes and trailers, that is, the television product of Universal, for exhibition on television in Canada, except for a designated television station in Windsor, Ontario.
