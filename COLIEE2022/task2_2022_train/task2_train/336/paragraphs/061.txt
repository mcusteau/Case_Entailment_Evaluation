[61]
For purposes of trial the parties were agreed that the television product licensed by Canadian exhibitors should be classified in four categories, based on B.V.'s accounting records, and that taxes in relation to three of those were here in issue. The four categories are:
1. theatrical features on 35 mm. or 16 mm. film,
2. theatrical features on videotape,
3. "made for television" productions on 35 mm. or 16 mm. film, and
4. "made for television" productions on videotape.
On the reassessment by the Minister, tax equivalent to that applicable to royalties on category 4 was eliminated, and the parties were agreed that, in the reassessment, product originally produced and retained on videotape for television exhibition was exempt from tax. The defendant's position is that categories 1, 2 and 3 are motion picture films, within Article XIIIC of the Canada-United States Treaty and royalties paid for use of product in those categories were excluded from the general exemption under that Article, and thus were taxable.
