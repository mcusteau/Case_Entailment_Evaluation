That argument, so far as it relates to the history of the tax conventions, I do not find persuasive, nor is the reference to the guidelines issued within the Department of National Revenue in 1987 for assessing payments made for live transmission and film/videotapes for use in connection with television, which relate to payments made under the Canada-U.S. Tax Conventions of 1942 and 1980. Finally, though both counsel urge, as supportive of their respective positions, reliance upon excerpts from United States reports, of the Department of State and of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, both in 1950, concerning the amending protocol containing Article XIIIC, I do not find these do more than explain the reason for the absence of complete reciprocal exemption from tax on royalties paid to a nonresident in respect of the use of motion picture films. That reason, the reluctance of Canada to exempt payments for such films because of a substantial imbalance in international payments heavily favouring the United States, does not provide meaning for the term "motion picture films" as used in the 1950 protocol, and Article XIIIC.
