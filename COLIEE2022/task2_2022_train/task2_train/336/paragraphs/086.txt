In my opinion the words "motion picture films" in Article XIIIC of the Canada-U.S. Tax Convention are to be given the meaning intended by the parties to the Convention in 1950 when that Article was incorporated by the Protocol amending the Convention of 1942. That meaning as I have found, was limited to films originally produced for theatrical exhibition. The use of films produced for television purposes and not intended for theatrical distribution would not be included. Thus, the product here identified by the parties in category 3, "made for television" productions on 35 mm. or 16 mm. film, is not within the meaning of the words "motion picture films" in Article XIIIC.
