The plaintiff's argument that the meaning of "motion picture films" as used in Article XIIIC can be derived from the history of Canadian tax legislation which made no specific reference to payments in respect of use of film or videotape for television until after the 1950 protocol is not by itself persuasive that prior statutory references to "motion picture films" should be restricted to theatrical product and that meaning ascribed to the words as used in Article XIIIC. It would find meaning in those words as used in pre-1950 tax statutes presuming from later amendments that Parliament intended to change the law, not merely to clarify it, contrary to s. 45(2) of the
Interpretation Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, which provides:
"45(2) The amendment of an enactment shall not be deemed to be or to involve a declaration that the law under that enactment was or was considered by Parliament or other body or person by whom the enactment was enacted to have been different from the law as it is under the enactment as amended."
That provision has been given effect in the case of income tax legislation, to preclude deriving meaning for words of an amended provision from its later amendments (
