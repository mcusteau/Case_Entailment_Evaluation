If I am held to be in error in that judgment, in the alternative I find that only two of three categories of television product identified by the parties for this trial are "motion picture films" for the purposes of Article XIIIC of the Canada-U.S. Income Tax Convention, 1942. Those two categories are theatrical features on 35 mm. or 16 mm. film, and theatrical features on videotape. Thus, payments made for use of those categories of television product are not exempt from tax under Article XIIIC. The third category, made for television productions on 35 mm. or 16 mm. film are not "motion picture films" for the purposes of Article XIIIC and payments in relation to the use of those products are exempt from tax.
