On the basis of my conclusion concerning the application of s. 212(5) in the case of B.V.'s operations in Canada in the years in question, there is no need to deal with the alternative issue raised by the plaintiff, for no tax liability for the plaintiff arises. Nevertheless, in the event that it should be held on appeal that I am in error in that conclusion, I turn to the alternative raised by the plaintiff as a ground upon which it was not liable for the tax assessed.
