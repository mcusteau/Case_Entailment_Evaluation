(1), the agent or other person shall, notwithstanding any agreement or law to the contrary, deduct or withhold therefrom the amount of the tax and forthwith remit that amount to the Receiver General of Canada on behalf of the person entitled to payment in payment of the tax and shall submit therewith a statement in prescribed form, and he shall thereupon, for purposes of accounting to the person entitled to payment, be deemed to have paid or credited that amount to him."
