There are several factors that lead me to conclude the words "motion picture films" in Article XIIIC, at the time of adoption of protocol in 1950, did not include all product produced for television using the medium or form of film. Rather, those words included only products, in whatever form they might later be delivered for television exhibition, which were originally created for theatrical exhibition. Those factors include the use of the term "motion picture film" in the industry in 1950, which continues to this day; the fact that the 1950 protocol, obviously based on negotiations in previous years, antedated the introduction of television broadcasting in Canada; and the fact that in the early 1950's it would have been quite impossible to anticipate the significant role film would ultimately come to play in television broadcasting, either in recording product intended for television or in the use, by adaption, of theatrical product. It may well be, as Mr. Gough, an officer of National Revenue who was examined in discovery as the witness for the defendant, indicated in his examination, that television broadcasters came to advertise made for television movies as "movies", but the evidence of Mr. Keeble, which I accept, is that those in the industry did not consider them to be "motion picture films", and moreover, that type of television product was not produced until the 1970's.
