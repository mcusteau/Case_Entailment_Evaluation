In my view, on the basis of the 1976 agreement, the plaintiff has not disproved the Minister's assumption that "the plaintiff's share of royalty payments received by MCA International, B.V., from the television stations and networks were received as collection agent of the plaintiff and not on MCA International's own account". However, that assumption describes B.V.'s relationship to the plaintiff without regard for the realities of B.V.'s relationship to Canadian television exhibitors and the lack of any legal relationship between those exhibitors and the plaintiff.
