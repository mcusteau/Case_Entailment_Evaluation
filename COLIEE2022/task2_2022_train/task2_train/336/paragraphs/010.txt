Article IX of the
Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Agreement (1957)
, is also relevant in this case, in respect of the submissions of the plaintiff. It provides:
"Article IX
1. Royalties -- other than royalties to which article III of this Convention applies -- derived from one of the States by a resident of the other State shall be subject to tax only in the latter State.
2. Where one of the States by way of deduction at the source levies a tax on royalties the right to levy such tax on royalties derived from sources within that State by a resident of the other State, is not affected by the first paragraph of this article, but the rate of tax shall in that case not exceed 15%.
3. Paragraph 2 of this article does not apply to copyright royalties and other like payments made in respect of the production or reproduction of any literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work."
