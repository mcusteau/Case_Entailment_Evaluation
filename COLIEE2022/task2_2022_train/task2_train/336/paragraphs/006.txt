As I understand the evidence, the tax related to royalties paid by television networks and broadcasters for use of all television product produced on film, including motion pictures originally made for theatrical distribution and subsequently modified on film for television, or other film product made for television, or trailers (i.e., advertising excerpts) produced on film, and videotape product made from motion pictures originally made for theatrical distribution. In essence, the reassessments resulted in a claim for taxes on the plaintiff's share of royalties paid by Canadian users of television product supplied under contracts negotiated by a Dutch company to which the payments were made if that product was originally produced on film even where that was subsequently transferred to videotape for television use, but no tax was applicable where the television product was originally produced on videotape for exhibition on television.
