I summarize my conclusions about the relationship of B.V. and the plaintiff. Under the 1976 agreement B.V. is the collection agent for the plaintiff for the latter's share of gross television receipts as defined by the agreement. B.V. is not the agent of the plaintiff in any other sense, and in all other respects it operated on its own account. If the agreement resulted in funds being funnelled through B.V. to the plaintiff, as the defendant contends, that has no legal significance for tax purposes unless the words of the statute provide for tax to be assessed in those circumstances. There are a variety possible arrangements, through corporate relations, by agency, by branch operations, by licensing or sales agreements whereby funds may be channelled through one agency to another. That in itself creates no tax liability unless the arrangement selected is one included within the statute for taxing purposes.
