Here, certain clauses of the 1976 agreement significantly limited authority of B.V., particularly in regard to changing the television product and the representations drawn from it. Those provisions, in my view, simply reflect the desire to protect the multitude of intellectual property interests, trademarks, copyrights and performing rights, in the product owned by the plaintiff and others than the parties to the 1976 agreement. Certain other clauses of the agreement clearly support the plaintiff's view that subject to its obligations to perform with due diligence and to maximize the television gross receipts from licensing the product within its agreed territory, and to accounting ex post facto, B.V. was to operate quite independently in all phases of the promotion and licensing of television product, including determination of the price, or license fee, to be charged to users of the product, and determination whether to sublicense to others its distribution rights in relation to parts of its territory.
