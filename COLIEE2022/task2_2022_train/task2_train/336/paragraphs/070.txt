It was Mr. Keeble's opinion, which I accept, that within the television industry the term "motion picture film" referred to a feature film produced initially for theatrical exhibition. In his view, in the television industry the purpose for which a particular product was produced was readily identifiable, and readily demonstrated whether it was for theatrical or television exhibition. Theatrical product might be adapted for television exhibition but product intended for television exhibition, presumably even a so-called made for T.V. movie, was not adapted for theatrical exhibition, at least for North American audiences, because by its original design it was unsuitable for the theatre market. The medium or form in which television programming was available, whether on 16 mm. film, on videotape, or I presume by satellite transmission, was unimportant, provided the television exhibitor had equipment to handle the product form. The matter of importance was the quality and nature of the product for its purposes for television.
