Here there was no suggestion that the agreements concluded between Canadian exhibitors and B.V. created any direct legal relationship between those exhibitors and the plaintiff. The agreements for licensing television product made no reference at all to the plaintiff; they created legal relations only between the exhibitors and B.V. Any debts owed by commitments to pay license fees were owed solely to B.V. and it was not suggested that the plaintiff could have acted against Canadian exhibitors for violation of the terms of the agreements concluded by them with B.V. In my opinion the words "for or on behalf of the person entitled to payment" in s. 215(3), modifying the verbs "paid or credited" relate to the purpose for which the payor, in this case the Canadian exhibitor, has made payment, not to the intent or purpose of the payee, B.V., on receipt of the payment.
