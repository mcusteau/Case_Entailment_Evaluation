The defendant submits that the doctrine of the undisclosed principal supports its position, as does the concept that payment to an agent constitutes payment to the principal. That doctrine, and that concept, relate to the relationship between the Canadian exhibitor and the plaintiff once an agency relationship between B.V. and the plaintiff is established. If there be no agency relationship, as I find, except as provided in one particular sense by the agreement, then the doctrine of the undisclosed principal, and the concept that the principal is paid by payment to the agent, simply have no application in this case.
