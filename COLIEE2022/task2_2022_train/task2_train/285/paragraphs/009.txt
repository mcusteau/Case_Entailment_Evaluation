As I informed Mr. X and counsel for the department at the hearing, the Court will not countenance dilatoriness on the part of any government institution. Even where a request may appear to be of limited importance and of low priority to a department official, that request must still be satisfied within the delay provided under the Act. In the instant case, the department official did not even extend to the applicant the courtesy of an explanation within the extended delay.
