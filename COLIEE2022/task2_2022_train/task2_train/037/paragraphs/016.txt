  While the failure on the part of the RPD to examine the Applicant's claim against St. Vincent and the Grenadines is indeed an important oversight, I am satisfied that it is not, in and of itself, fatal to the RPD's decision if the finding by the RPD that state protection exists for the Applicant in Trinidad withstands this review. Put another way, if the Applicant can return to Trinidad with reasonable impunity, as the RPD concluded, then whether or not he could return to St. Vincent and the Grenadines with impunity becomes irrelevant. His claim must fail.
