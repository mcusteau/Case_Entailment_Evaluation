  The Applicant is, according to his passport, a citizen of St. Vincent and the Grenadines. That being said, entries in that passport indicate that he exercised a right of return from time to time to Trinidad and Tobago, more specifically, Trinidad [see footnote 1]. It was not in dispute before the Court, that prior to coming to Canada, the Applicant lived almost all of his life in Trinidad.
