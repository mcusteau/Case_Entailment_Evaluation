 [24] 
  Counsel for the Applicant relied heavily on the decision of this Court in  
 Siddiqui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  [see footnote 9] where my colleague Justice Phelan wrote at paragraph 18 of his reasons: 
 
 
 
 What undermines the Board's decision is the failure to address the contradictory finding in the  
 Memon 
  decision. It may well be that the member disagreed with the findings in  
 Memon 
  and may have had good sustainable reasons for so doing. However, the Applicant is entitled, as a matter of fairness and the rendering of a full decision, to an explanation of why this particular member, reviewing the same documents, on the same issue, could reach a different conclusion.
