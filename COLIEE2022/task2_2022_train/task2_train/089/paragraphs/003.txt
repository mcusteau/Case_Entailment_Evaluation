  In early May of 2003, Dr. Chew received complaints from Larsen and from the New Brunswick Pork Producers Association that too many hogs were being condemned as unfit at the Larsen facility in Berwick. Larsen alleged that its condemnation rate was more than double the rate experienced by other Canadian packing plants. In a letter dated May 7, 2003, the Chairman of the New Brunswick Pork Producers Association made the following complaint to Dr. Chew: 
 
 
 
 "We are writing at this time in regards to a situation that has been on-going at the Larsen Packer plant in Berwick Nova Scotia for some time. 
 
 
 
 "We are very concerned about the large number of hogs being condemned at this facility and it is unprecedented according to our history in the business. This situation is placing an unfair burden on our producers and is resulting in great financial loss. 
 
 
 
 "We understand that Dr. Scott Frazee was not supposed to be present on the kill floor the last couple of days and another vet would be conducting the inspections. Apparently, this has not been the case. We understand that he has been present on the kill floor and the condemnation of our hogs continues.  
 This situation is unacceptable to our producers and cannot continue. 
 
 
 
 " 
 We are requesting that Dr. Scott Frazee be removed from the Larsen Packer plant immediately or our producers will have no other option but to redirect their hogs to another facility. No other option is acceptable.
