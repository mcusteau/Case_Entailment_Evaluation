  The Adjudicator seems to have concluded that what began as an administrative investigation of an outside complaint slipped into a disciplinary suspension of Dr. Frazee. The Adjudicator's reasons for characterizing the CFIA's actions as disciplinary are contained within the following brief passage from his decision: 
 
 
 
 "Firstly, the decision of the employer was directed personally against Dr. Frazee, and none of the other members of the CFIA inspection staff at the Larsen Packers Ltd. plant were involved in similar allegations of excessive condemnation during that period. Secondly, the allegations of wrongdoing on the part of Dr. Frazee were repeatedly made. Thirdly, Dr. Frazee was directed on four different occasions not to perform an important part of his duties within a short period of time. Fourthly, the CFIA management decided that they could not perform their investigation into the allegations of excessive condemnation without suspending him from an important part of his duties in postmortem evaluations. In those circumstances, I conclude that the suspensions from performing final condemnation and from being present on the kill floor between May 5 and June 25, 2003 imposed on Dr. Frazee were disciplinary in nature; the CFIA justified those decisions on the basis of the allegations of excessive condemnation rates. 
 
 
 
 "The disciplinary nature of the employer's decision to suspend Dr. Frazee from an important part of his duties is adjudicable pursuant to subparagraph 92(1)(b)(i) of the former  
 Act 
  and gives me jurisdiction to adjudicate the grievance."
