I agree with the Applicants that there is no requirement under the
Indian Act
or any other legislation that has been brought to the Court's attention that requires a referendum band custom process to be initiated or passed in a specified way. The issue is whether the
Nekaneet Constitution
and
Nekaneet Governance
Act
have been adopted by, and are acceptable to, a broad consensus of the Nekaneet First Nation, as "broad consensus" is defined by the governing jurisprudence. If it has been so adopted and accepted then the Nekaneet people have decided that it will govern future chief and band council elections, and elections that do not comply with the relevant provisions will not be valid.
