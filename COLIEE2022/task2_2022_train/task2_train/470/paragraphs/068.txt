Once again, however, the Respondents' own actions and evidence would seem to belie the assertion that the changes were not sufficiently understood to make the Referendum Vote meaningful. Obviously, the Respondents and their followers knew precisely what was at stake and what the changes would mean. They knew this so well (and they had legal advice) that they were aware they had to boycott and thwart the referendum process to stand a chance of preserving the status quo. They knew it so well that they organized a petition that they say supports the old ways of electing the chief and band councils. So it is pretty hard for the Court to accept as a general proposition that the Respondents and their followers knew what was at stake and, in effect, petitioned against it, but that those Nekaneet people who participated in the Referendum Vote did not. What is more, I believe that other evidence adduced does not support the Respondents' position on this issue. The Applicants' evidence on this issue suggests that, although members of the community may not have understood all of the detail in the documentation that was distributed and which eventually became the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
, they were certainly aware that they had a choice to make between a dysfunctional status quo that allowed too much scope for self-interest, and a new governance regime that would bring much more transparency and accountability to Nekaneet in a way that would benefit the community as a whole.
