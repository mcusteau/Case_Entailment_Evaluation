More recently, in
Francis et al. v. Mohawk Council of Kanesatake et al.
, [2003] 3 C.N.L.R. 86; 227 F.T.R. 161; 2003 FCT 115 Justice Martineau was called upon to resolve a dispute between competing factions. He confirmed that the
Indian Act
does not set out guidelines as to how a band custom is to be identified and his approach is consistent with the words of Justice Strayer in
Bigstone
and Justice Reed in
McLeod Lake
. He points out that practices related to the choice of council must be generally acceptable to members of the band on a broad consensus. Significantly, Justice Martineau concluded that such practices may be established either through repetitive acts over time, or through a single act such as the adoption of an electoral code. He says at paragraph 37 that "whether a particular band resolution, decision or an adopted electoral code reflects the custom of the band can be framed as follows: is the resolution, decision or code based on a majority consensus of all those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the band, regardless of residence?"
