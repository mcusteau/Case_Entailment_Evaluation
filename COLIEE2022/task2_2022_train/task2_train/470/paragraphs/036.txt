The election of the Respondents as the chief and band council was based upon a band custom passed by a show of hands at a band meeting called for that purpose and held on March 14, 2008. This means that the Respondents may have no right to hold office as the Nekaneet band council either because:
a. Their election was not in accordance with Nekaneet custom as such custom existed prior to the passing of the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
; or
b. Their election did not take place in accordance with the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
if those instruments have superseded any prior custom regarding the election of chief and band council.
