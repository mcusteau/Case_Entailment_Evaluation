There is some conflict in the evidence before me in this application. This is inevitable given the different approaches to governance that each side represents. The Applicants see themselves as bringing a new, more transparent and more accountable approach to governance of the Nekaneet First Nation. The Respondents, on the other hand, see themselves as the embodiment of traditional custom and practice that does not need the new approach found in the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
. In fact, the Respondents regard these instruments as being totally at odds with traditional custom and practice and as detrimental to the identity of the Nekaneet First Nation.
