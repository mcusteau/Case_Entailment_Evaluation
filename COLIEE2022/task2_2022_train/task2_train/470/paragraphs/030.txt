The Applicants have identified the following issues for the Court to decide:
1. Is this application appropriate having regard to the preconditions in the
Federal Court Act
and
Federal Courts Rules
and the existence of Federal Court Action No. T-481-08 commenced by Statement of Claim. This brings up several specific issues:
a. Is the within application under section 18(1) of the
Federal Courts Rules
appropriate?
b. Is a decision of the Respondents, as a tribunal, required as a pre-condition for the within judicial review application?
c. Does the action commenced by Statement of Claim in Federal Court Action T-481-08 constitute a bar to the within judicial review proceedings?
2. Which of the Referendum Band Custom passed by the Referendum Vote of February 25, 2008 and the Second Band Custom passed on March 14, 2008 by way of a show of hands at a meeting of the Nekaneet membership is valid? This seems to involve the following specific issues:
a. If the Referendum Band Custom was validly passed, does it invalidate the Second Band Custom because the Second Band Custom did not come about in accordance with the process contained in the
Nekateet Constitution
?
b. Must a referendum vote for a band custom be initiated by a resolution of the incumbent band council and was Nekaneet limited to band customs passed by a show of hands at a meeting called for such purpose?
c. Did the Referendum Band Custom satisfy the test of being generally acceptable to the members of the Nekaneet First Nation on which there was a broad consensus?
d. Did any of the acknowledged irregularities in the conduct of the Referendum Vote invalidate that vote?
