  Justice Wetston also refused Glaxo's request for an award of costs above the amount provided for in Tariff B. He was of the view that it was in the most exceptional case that the Court should depart from Tariff B in an award of party and party costs. I agree and refuse the defendants' request for a lump sum amount beyond Tariff B.
