  In terms of the scale of costs, Justice Reed stated that Column III level costs are designed to address a case of average complexity. (I note Rule 407 provides, unless otherwise ordered by the Court, costs shall be taxed in accordance with Column III.) In the case before her, Justice Reed directed the assessment officer to assess costs at trial at the maximum end of Column V of the table to Tariff B and to allow counsel fee for two senior and one junior counsel. The Federal Court of Appeal maintained Justice Reed in her Column V award. (See,
