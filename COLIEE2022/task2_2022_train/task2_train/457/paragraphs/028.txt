[28]
I accept the respondent's argument that deference must be given to the officer's decision and in the case at bar it was reasonable for the officer to make the determinations underlying the decision at issue. On considering the decision made by the officer, I cannot find that it was unreasonable. It was based on the evidence in the record and the interpretation of that evidence was reasonable. In my view, the decision is not vitiated by any error requiring intervention by this Court through judicial review.
