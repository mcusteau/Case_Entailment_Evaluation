The documents filed by the applicant on the situation prevailing in Turkey with regard to human rights violations are not, the officer commented, related solely to the applicant's personal situation. The officer noted that danger will not be recognized only on the basis of the general situation in the country of origin, but rather on the applicant's personal situation, as to whether he has a justified fear of persecution, torture, a risk to his life or unusual treatment or punishment. Accordingly, the officer ruled that the applicant had to submit new evidence to support the alleged risks and show that those risks were personal, for the following reason:
(Translation)
"... The function of the PRRA risk assessment is not to revise the decision made by the [Board], but to rule on the risks involved in returning based on new evidence and the objective situation in the applicants' country of nationality, Turkey."
Thus, the application was analyzed in terms of the present conditions in Turkey, in particular the situation of Kurds of the Alevi religion.
