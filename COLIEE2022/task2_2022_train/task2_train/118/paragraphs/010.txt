 [10] 
  The issue herein is whether there was any basis for the Appeal Division to have found that in law and in fact that Vaneet was adopted in accordance with the various applicable provision of  
 HAMA 
 . On the basis of the record before the Appeal Division, this court is unable to determine, with any certainty, whether under Hindu law this would not be a valid adoption, despite the literal interpretive approach urged by counsel for the applicant. In this instance, I am unable to conclude that an error of law was made. The content of the foreign law is a question of fact. How the foreign law is applied is a question of law. I am of the opinion that the application of the foreign law to the facts as found by the Division does not warrant the intervention of this court.
