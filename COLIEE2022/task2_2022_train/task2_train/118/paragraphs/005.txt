  This judicial review raises two issues: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the Appeal Division err in finding that Vaneet was adopted in accordance with the provisions of the  
 Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act 1956  
 (" 
 HAMA 
 ")?; and 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Appeal Division err in failing to assess the factual circumstances surrounding the adoption and the issue of whether the adoption created a relationship of parent and child as described the definition of "adoption" contained in s. 2(1) of the  
 Immigration Regulations 
 , 1978?
