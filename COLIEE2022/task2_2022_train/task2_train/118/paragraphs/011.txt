  With respect to the second issue as to whether the adoption created a relationship of parent and child, it is clear that the Appeal Division erred in failing to assess the factual circumstances surrounding the adoption. In concluding that a valid foreign adoption results in the creation of a parent and child relationship, the Appeal Division cannot have considered the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in  
 Singh 
 , supra. A parent and child relationship is not automatically established once the requirements of a foreign adoption have been demonstrated. In other words, even if the adoption was within the provisions of  
 HAMA 
 , whether the adoption created a relationship of parent and child, thereby satisfying the requirements of the definition of "adoption" contained in s. 2(1) of the  
 Immigration Regulations 
 , 1978, must still be examined. While I doubt, on these facts, that the requisite parent and child relationship has been established, that is a determination which ought to be made by the Appeal Division.
