  The Appeal Division recognized that on a review of the appropriate sections of  
 HAMA 
  it would appear that the passing of the child by the natural mother to the adoptive mother would make this adoption void. However, in light of the circumstances, the adoption was determined to have been valid. The applicant's position with regard to the Appeal Division's determination is straight forward. To give means to physically give which is different than to consent and since the child's natural father was alive, and  
 HAMA 
  provides that the father alone has the right to give in adoption, then the adoption is void.
