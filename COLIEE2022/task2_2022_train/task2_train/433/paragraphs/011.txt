On February 13, 2001, Mr. Aslam travelled to Islamabad to apply for a Canadian Visitor's Visa as he was planning to come to Canada on a business trip. The Visa was issued two days later. On February 17, 2001, he travelled to Islamabad to pick up the Visa then travelled to Faisalabadto appear in court to make a statement in regards to the criminal case against the SSP for the fire at the textile factory. On February 18, 2001, after making their statement in court, Mr. Aslam and his cousin were on their way home in separate cars. Two SSP members on motorcycles pulled up beside his cousin's car and fired at it. His two cousins and the driver of the car were killed. He stayed in Faisalabad for a couple of days before returning to Karachi. There, his wife informed him that she had received a phone call in which the caller said Mr. Aslam may have got away this time but they would kill him too.
