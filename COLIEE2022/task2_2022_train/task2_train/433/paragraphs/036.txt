The test with respect to an IFA is two pronged: the Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the proposed IFA and that in all the circumstances, including the circumstances particular to those claimants, the conditions in the proposed IFA are such that it is not unreasonable for the applicants to seek refuge there.
