In this case, Mr. Aslam travelled to Canada in May 2001, returned to Pakistan in June 2001 and travelled again to Canada with his family in August 2001. It would be expected that if Mr. Aslam's fear was well-founded, he would have made a claim at the first opportunity of safety on his first trip to Canada in May 2001 rather than return to the country against which he is making a claim of refugee protection. When asked the reason for the delay, he explained that he returned to see his family because they had missed him. Furthermore, even though Mr. Aslam testified that his family was in danger, he left them in Pakistan when he first travelled to Canada. The Board made a negative inference from this behaviour that goes directly to Mr. Aslam's lack of subjective fear.
