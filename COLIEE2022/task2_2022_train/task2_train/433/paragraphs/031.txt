The paragraphs from the documentary evidence that are relied upon by the Aslam family were part of the total evidence which the Board was entitled to weigh as to its reliability and cogency. (Hassan) [see footnote 8] The preference of certain elements of the documentary evidence over others is a matter of weight for the Board. As long as the Board has evidence before it which supports its ultimate conclusion, this Court should not interfere with that conclusion. (Arunachalam) [see footnote 9]
