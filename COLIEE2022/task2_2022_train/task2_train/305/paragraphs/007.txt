[7]
One effect of the issuance of a security certificate, provided for in section 77(2) of the
Act
, is that upon referral of the certificate to the Court, any proceeding under the
Act
may neither be commenced nor continued in respect of the person named in a security certificate. The one exception to this provision is an application for protection under section 112(1) of the
Act
. The stay of proceeding provided in section 77(2) continues until a decision is made as to whether the security certificate is reasonable.
