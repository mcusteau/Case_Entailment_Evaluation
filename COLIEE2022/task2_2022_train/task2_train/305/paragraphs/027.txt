There are, in my respectful view, two difficulties with this submission. First, section 112(1) does not refer to persons referred to "in sections 115(1) and (2)". It would have been easy for the provision to have so read if that was Parliament's intent. Second, for section 115(2) to operate to exclude a person from section 115(1) in circumstances such as face Mr. Harkat, the person must be "inadmissible on grounds of security". I am not satisfied that simply being named in a certificate makes one inadmissible on grounds of security within the contemplation of section 115(2) because it is not until the security certificate is found to be reasonable that the inadmissibility of the person named in the certificate is conclusively proven. (See: section 81(a) of the
Act
). Any suggestion of such inadmissibility would not, it seems to me, remain if the certificate were to be quashed. This interpretation is consistent with the position of the Crown on this motion, which is that Mr. Harkat is not inadmissible until the Court determines the certificate to be reasonable.
