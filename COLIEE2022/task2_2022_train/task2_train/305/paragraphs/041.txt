A final point. Mr. Harkat relied upon the decision of my colleague Mr. Justice MacKay in
Jaballah, Re
(2002), 224 F.T.R. 20; 2002 FCT 1046 (T.D.), in support of his interpretation of the
Act
. However, Mr. Jaballah was not a Convention refugee and so his circumstances are distinguishable from those of Mr. Harkat. Mr. Justice MacKay was not required to consider the legislative scheme as it applies to a Convention refugee.
