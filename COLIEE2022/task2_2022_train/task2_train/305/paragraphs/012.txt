"Refugee Protection" is a new concept contained in the
Act
. A person is granted refugee protection, pursuant to section 95 of the
Act
, when he or she is found to be either a Convention refugee as defined by the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
(which definition is incorporated into the
Act
in section 96), or when found to be a person in need of protection as defined in section 97(1) of the
Act
. People who fall within the definition of a "person in need of protection" are persons that are described in Article 1 of the
United Nations Convention Against Torture
or are persons who would have been granted protection under the former
Immigration Act
as members of the Post-Determination Refugee Claimants in Canada Class.
