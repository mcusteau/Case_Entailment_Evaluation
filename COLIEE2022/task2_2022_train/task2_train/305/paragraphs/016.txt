A significant benefit is conferred upon protected persons. Section 115(1) provides that a protected person
shall not
be removed from Canada to a country where they would be a risk of persecution for a Convention ground, or be at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. There are narrow exceptions to this protection. The exception to this general principle of non-refoulement of potential application to Mr. Harkat is contained in section 115(2)(b) of the
Act
, which provides that a person who is inadmissible on grounds of security may be returned to a country where there is risk of persecution if, in the opinion of the Minister, the person should not be allowed to remain in Canada on the basis of the nature and severity of acts committed, or of danger to the security of Canada.
