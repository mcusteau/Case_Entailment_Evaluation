If the certificate is determined to be reasonable, three things follow, as set out in section 81 of the

. They are that the certificate:
(a) is conclusive proof that the permanent resident or foreign national named in it is inadmissible;
(b) is a removal order that may not be appealed against, and is in force; and
(c) the person named in it may not apply for protection under section 112(1).
