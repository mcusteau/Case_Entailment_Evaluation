shall
, pursuant to section 79(1) of the

, suspend the proceeding with respect to the reasonableness of the certificate in order to allow the Minister to reach his or her decision with respect to the application for protection. When the Minister has reached that decision, the Minister is required to give notice of the decision to the foreign national and to the designated judge, at which time the judge shall resume the certificate proceedings.

Such review is to be done on the basis of the grounds for judicial review listed in section 18.1(4) of the
Federal Court Act
. See: section 79(2) of the
