Section 112(3) provides that applicants who are inadmissible on grounds which include being named in a security certificate, are only eligible to receive a modified pre-removal risk assessment. A person named in a security certificate is not assessed against the fear of persecution within the meaning of the
United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees
, but rather is assessed only against the grounds enumerated in section 97 of the
Act
. (See: section 113(d) of the
Act
). This requires assessment of whether the applicant is at risk of torture, or risk to his or her life, or risk of cruel and unusual treatment.
