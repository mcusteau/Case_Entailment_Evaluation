I believe that there appears to be an element of desperation to the applicant's Originating Notice of Motion for judicial review before the Federal Court. The proper course of action is to seek redress in the provincial court of appeal for judicial review of a decision of the Minister in extradition matters. In the applicant's affidavit, there is an allusion to the fact that the applicant made an unsuccessful application for judicial review of the Minister's actual surrender order dated October 29, 1994 to the Ontario Court of Appeal (paragraph 6, page 2, Garcia Affidavit, Tab D, Affidavit of Dalila Sousa).
