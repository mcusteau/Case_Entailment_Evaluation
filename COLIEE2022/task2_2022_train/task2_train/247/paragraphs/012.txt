In the case of
Bull (David) Laboratories (Canada) Inc. v. Pharmacia Inc. et al.
, [1995] 1 F.C. 588; 176 N.R. 48 (F.C.A.), it was held:
"The remedy of striking out a notice of motion was not available in these circumstances. Rule 419 permits the court, at any stage of an 'action', to order any 'pleading' to be struck out. Rule 2 defines 'action' as a proceeding in the Trial Division 'other than an appeal, an application or an originating motion', and 'pleading' as any document whereby an action in the Trial Division is initiated. Rule 419 does not directly authorize the striking out of a notice of motion. An application commenced by notice of motion is not an 'action' and the notice of motion is not a 'pleading'.
"The contrast between actions and motions in this court is even more marked where the motion involved is for judicial review."
