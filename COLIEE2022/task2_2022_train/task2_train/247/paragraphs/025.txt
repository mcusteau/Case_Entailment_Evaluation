I am satisfied that the letter of the Minister dated February 14, 1997 is an extradition matter and is therefore subject to s. 25.2(1) of the
Extradition Act
. I am satisfied that the carrying out of an Order of Extradition is part of the Extradition Order and not a separate decision. It is one decision, to extradite and to execute the extradition. Before s. 25.2(1) came into force, the Federal Court did have jurisdiction to carry out a judicial review of the decision of the Minister:
DesFossés v. Canada (Minister of Justice)
, [1996] F.C.J. No. 1325; 120 F.T.R. 294 (T.D.) (Under the transitional provision of the amendments to the
Extradition Act
,
DesFossés
was decided according to the
Act
as it read before the coming into force of s. 25.2(1). Section 7, S.C. 1992, c. 13, reads, "Any matter in respect of which an extradition hearing has commenced before a judge referred to in section 13 of the
Extradition Act
on the day on which this section comes into force, any proceeding on habeas corpus from such a matter, any decision of the Minister of Justice on such a matter, any proceeding on habeas corpus from such a decision and any appeal from such a matter, decision or habeas corpus proceeding shall be heard and disposed of as though this
Act
had not been enacted."). However, in the light of the changes to the
Extradition Act
, changes made to streamline the extradition hearing (See
House of Commons Debates
(7 November 1991), at 4777-4779), appeal and judicial review process, this court does not have jurisdiction to hear an application for judicial review of the decision of the Minister or issue interim relief pursuant to that application. The fact that the applicant has also filed a Notice of Constitutional Question does not confer jurisdiction. In
Mooring v. National Parole Board et al.
, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 75; 192 N.R. 161; 70 B.C.A.C. 1; 115 W.A.C. 1, at 171, the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed that under s. 24(1) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, 1982, a court will only be a "court of competent jurisdiction" for the purposes of s. 24(1) where it has jurisdiction over the parties, the subject matter and the remedy sought by the complainant. The Federal Court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the applicant's claim and is therefore not a court of competent jurisdiction.
