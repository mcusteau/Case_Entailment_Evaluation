Counsel for the applicant made submissions to the A.G.C. on October 29, 1996 and February 6, 1997 (pages 31-41, 72, Garcia Affidavit), seeking assurances that the applicant would not be extradited pending the outcome of his claim for refugee status. In a letter dated February 14, 1997, a Senior Policy Advisor for the A.G.C. responded to the applicant's earlier requests in the following fashion:
"You have submitted that Mr. Garcia's surrender to the United States of America should not take place until his refugee claim has been processed and decided.
"In the particular circumstances of this case, please be advised that the Minister is not prepared to seek assurances that execution of the surrender order will be held in abeyance if Mr. Garcia is not successful in his appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada." (page 76, Garcia Affidavit)
