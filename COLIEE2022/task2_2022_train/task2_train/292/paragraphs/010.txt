In this case, the applicant stated that she was a citizen of Croatia and Yugoslavia. She clearly thought that the Board understood she was talking about the former Yugoslavia and not the new Yugoslavia. In my view, the Board misunderstood the applicant's citizenship status in the new Yugoslavia. The Board does not have jurisdiction to determine the likelihood of persecution for a person in a country of which she is not a citizen. It is contrary to natural justice to permit a decision to stand, when it is based on a misunderstanding of a crucial element of the applicant's evidence, as is the case here.
