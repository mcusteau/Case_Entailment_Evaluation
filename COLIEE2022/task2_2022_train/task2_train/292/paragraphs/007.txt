The applicant, as stated above, spent five weeks in Belgrade and was unable to obtain any employment. Clearly the applicant does not come within the exception cited in this document. The onus is on the applicant to show that she comes within the definition of Convention refugee. In a complex situation such as exists in Yugoslavia where the former republics are disintegrating, there is a duty on the Board to at least question the applicant about how she obtained her passport in light of the fact that she was not a resident of Serbia nor in a position to earn a living there.
