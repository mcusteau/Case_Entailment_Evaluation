Counsel for Mr. McAllister sought to distinguish the circumstances of
Nguyen
from those in this case. Clearly there are differences in the facts, but in my view the Court of Appeal's decision in that case is persuasive in this and its principles and approach should here be followed. Thus, the provisions of the
Act
here followed by the Minister in his decision of May 26, 1994, i.e., ss. 46.01(1)(e)(ii), 27(2)(a), and 19(1)(f)(iii)(B), provide for a valid process under the
Act
, which does not violate principles of fundamental justice, in light of s. 7 of the
Charter
, s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, or natural justice requirements at common law, provided the process here followed meets requirements for a fair hearing. While it is argued otherwise for the applicant, the facts here clearly indicate, in my view, that the applicant was apprised of the case he had to meet by the letter dated February 22, 1994 and was given adequate opportunity to respond to that case by written submissions.
