[59]
At the conclusion of the hearing counsel were invited to propose questions for consideration for certification under s. 83(1) as serious questions of general importance. For the applicant it was urged that there were several serious issues raised by this case, but no specific question was submitted for consideration. Counsel for the respondent indicated that since constitutional issues were not directly raised, the only serious issue related to the application of the amending statutes, i.e., whether in the circumstances the legislation as applied was given retrospective effect and if this was warranted. In my opinion, the facts of the case do not directly raise issues that would be determinative of an appeal, and there is not, in my view, a serious question concerning retrospective application of the amending acts. Thus, I decline to certify a question under s. 83(1).
Applications dismissed.
