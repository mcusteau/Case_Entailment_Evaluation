In the first application for judicial review (IMM-3223-94) it is urged that the applicant's rights in relation to his claim vested under s. 7 of the
Charter
before the eligibility criteria under s. 46.01 were enacted and it is wrong in law to deprive him of a remedy, the right to make his claim, on the basis of law not existing when the claim was made. It is said ss. 46.01(1)(e)(ii) and 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) should not be given retroactive application. In the second application (IMM-4348-94) it is said the applicant's right to a fair hearing were entrenched on the date he made his refugee claim. It would be wrong in law, it is urged, to give retroactive effect to current provisions of ineligibility under the
Act
. In written submissions it is urged that to give the current legislation effect would violate the applicant's equality rights under s. 15 of the
Charter
, but that was not argued at the hearing of this matter.
