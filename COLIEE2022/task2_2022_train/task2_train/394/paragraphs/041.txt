The concept of "vagueness" as a flaw in criminal legislation violating s. 7 of the
Charter
was earlier dealt with by the court in
R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society et al. (No. 2)
, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606, at pp. 642-643; 139 N.R. 241, at pp. 281-282; 114 N.S.R.(2d) 91; 313 A.P.R. 91; 74 C.C.C.(3d) 289, at 313; 15 C.R.(4th) 1; 43 C.P.R.(3d) 1; 93 D.L.R.(4th) 36; 10 C.R.R.(2d) 34, where the issue concerned validity of then s.Â 32(1) of the
Combines Investigation Act
creating an offence to prevent or lessen competition "unduly". Mr. Justice Gonthier, speaking for the court, stated that the doctrine of vagueness applies to all types of enactments:
"Finally, I also wish to point out that the standard I have outlined applies to all enactments, irrespective of whether they are civil, criminal, administrative or other. The citizen is entitled to have the State abide by constitutional standards of precision whenever it enacts legal dispositions.
. . . . .
"The doctrine of vagueness can therefore be summed up in this proposition: a law will be found unconstitutionally vague if it so lacks in precision as not to give sufficient guidance for legal debate. This statement of the doctrine best conforms to the dictates of the rule of law in the modern State, and it reflects the prevailing argumentative, adversarial framework for the administration of justice."
