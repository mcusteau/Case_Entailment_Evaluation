I am not persuaded to so find. In
Akthar v. Minister of Employment & Immigration
, [1991] 3 F.C. 32; 129 N.R. 71; 14 Imm. L.R.(2d) 39; 50 Admin. L.R. 153 (F.C.A.), Mr. Justice Hugessen for the Court of Appeal found that in the circumstances of the case a delay of two and one-half to three years between the making of a refugee claim and the holding of a credible basis hearing, then the first stage in processing of the claim, did not give rise to a
Charter
remedy. In that case it was stated that a claim in a noncriminal case to
Charter
relief based on delay requires evidence, or at the very least some inference from the surrounding circumstances, that the claimant has in fact suffered prejudice or unfairness because of the delay. As Hugessen, J.A., pointed out in that case, no time limits are specified under the
Act
, even though Parliament has sought to devise a process for considering refugee claims that is expeditious. Moreover, intervention by the court to strike down a decision that has been delayed may simply result in more delay without in any way establishing a basis for the claim to refugee status. Thus, in this case even if the Minister's decision here questioned were to be struck down, Mr. McAllister remains a member of an inadmissible class described in s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) by reason of the decision of an adjudicator in January 1994, a decision not questioned by the applicant. Under the
Act
such a person is not entitled to remain in Canada and is subject to deportation on order of an adjudicator under s. 32 of the
Act
.
