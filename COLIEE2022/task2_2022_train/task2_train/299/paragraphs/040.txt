But if I follow the applicable law on such matters, I am unable to subscribe to this argument. I note that the adjudicator clearly assessed the implications of Mr. Lynch's report and analyzed the evidence presented to her as a basis for judging the accuracy of this report. I have found that the evidence corresponded to the problems outlined in that report, and I conclude that the adjudicator was right to refuse to substitute her judgment for that of Mr. Lynch. Furthermore, I think the remarks by Marceau, J.A., are very pertinent to this case since the employer, when all is said and done, is in the best position to judge an employee's competence objectively.
