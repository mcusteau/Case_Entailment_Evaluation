After observing the applicant's management, Mr. Lynch prepared a report on the applicant's performance evaluation for the period between August 1992 and October 1995, which states:
[Translation]
"Report on performance evaluation and professional development
J.H. M.B. Gauthier
For the period August 1992 to October 1995
"
Mr. Gauthier's evaluation covers both his position as a security officer (from May 3, 1992 to May 17, 1993) and his position as head of protection operations at the MAOC (from May 17, 1992 to now).
"
As a MAOC security officer
, Mr. Gauthier demonstrated that he had a good understanding of the essential concepts of industrial security. He often made suggestions to his department head in this regard and was always prepared to volunteer for any addition work.
His performance during this period was 'entirely satisfactory'.
"
When the position of head of protection operations at the MAOC became vacant, Mr. Gauthier applied for and obtained the position
. It was his knowledge and experience of industrial security in particular that led to his selection. For example, when Michel obtained this position, the MAOC had not had a full-time protection operations head for a fairly long time, and Michel had to carry out a considerable amount of work to ensure that the operations went normally. During this period, Michel worked very hard and put in a lot of overtime.
"
Under the general direction of the department head - Operations
, Mr. Gauthier handles operations pertaining to security at the MAOC and manages a staff of 16 security officers. He handles, together with the specialized security technician, the duties of representatives of the Protection Services Division for anything having to do with security. He provides all Bank personnel working at the MAOC with the necessary advice and supervision in relation to protection of the premises, persons and information. He is responsible for developing procedures and guidelines pertaining to all security functions and systems within the MAOC.
"Mr. Gauthier has a great concern for detail and thoroughly studies any security-related project that interests him. Any request for information he receives results in a mass of correspondence, articles and recommendations.
His immense capacity for work and his search for perfection must, in all fairness, be emphasized. However, he should be careful not to become too involved in a particular aspect of his work, as this can lead him to devote an excessive amount of time to it to the detriment of his managerial duties. Mr. Gauthier must avoid over-extending himself and see that he manages his time adequately so that the priorities he has set jointly with the head office can be met. Michel might thereby have more time for the management duties. He could thereby do a lot to dissipate the impression his employees have that he is distant and disinclined to maintain good interpersonal relations.
"
Like many workaholics
, Mr. Gauthier gives the impression of being a solitary person who seems to prefer doing everything himself, so that each thing is done according to his personal standards, which are very high. He does not often involve his staff in his projects or voluntarily seek out opinions or their participation.
Accordingly, since his employees think he has little or even no confidence in them, the morale among the security officers is very low. They feel isolated and recognize few leadership skills in him.
This is a matter of concern since, in a crisis situation, they will as a matter of fact have to count on Michel's leadership skills and perhaps even rely on the soundness of his judgment for their own security and even their lives.
"
Michel's ability to maintain good relationships with others, to communicate and to assume management tasks has proved to be weak. His conduct with his colleagues has resulted in a lot of friction in both Montr√©al and Ottawa. Michel was urged to take a Situational Leadership course in Ottawa in the hope he would overcome his weaknesses. Unfortunately, Michel thought this course was worthless and has since demonstrated that he got almost nothing out of it. Michel is convinced that his approach is the only valid one, and this will always be an obstacle to the development of his management capacities.
"At the outset of his career with the Bank, Michel showed that he was prepared to break with the status quo. His superiors at first considered this a very fine quality that they should encourage. But they gradually came to realize that this quality was in fact a weakness owing to Michel's approach. There is a right way and a wrong way to produce changes in an organization. Michel is always quick to criticize a policy or procedure of the Bank, whether it concerns security, training, human resources or even accounting. The heart-breaking thing is that in most cases his criticisms are not really justified and, even after the policy or procedure has been explained to him,
Michel will tirelessly pursue the mission he has set for himself of convincing his co-workers that the Bank is wrong and he is right
.
"
The Division's management has spent many hours trying to 'persuade' Michel that his approach was neither desirable nor acceptable, either for the Division or for the Bank. The difficult thing is that Michel considers any criticism of his suggestions as a personal attack on himself.
Even when he indicates agreement on a point, he takes advantage of the first opportunity that occurs to put this point back on the table in the presence of another person in order to get that person to line up with him.
This divide and rule approach has become something of a pain, and we have pointed out to him that he didn't need to do this and that it was a very poor use of his time as a manager.
"
Michel has a poor understanding of his role and responsibilities as protection operations head with the MAOC
. He seems to think that compliance with the policies and procedures is optional and that he can adapt these to his own needs.
We have told him many times that he is our representative with the MAOC and not an independent agent. He continually modifies the procedures or does not take into account the policies in security matters on the pretext that he knows best what's going on
.
"Finally, in view of the dangers and risks that are always present, the way in which Michel enforces industrial security and the solutions he proposes have proved to be too Draconian for the Bank.
Michel should take into account the degree of probability that the apprehended events will occur and not always prepare with a view to the worst possible outcome
. The Bank is an institution in which security and operational needs must be assessed according to their respective merits. No security program will ever completely eliminate the risk of property loss, and it is our job to assess the dangers and risks and determine the appropriate optimal security.
"In short, although there is no doubting Michel's integrity or his willingness to protect the Bank's property,
he must show his readiness to accept and consistently adhere to the Division's policies and procedures, as well as those of the Bank. Furthermore, Michel should spend more time with his staff to manage them, supervise them, train them and explain his views to them. He must stop being a manager fixed on doing his own thing, who communicates with his staff through memoranda
.
"
During the period covered by this evaluation, Michel failed to fulfill the major requirements of his position, which has earned him the 'less than satisfactory' classification. It is to be hoped that Michel will take these observations into account and that with the help of his superior he will make some efforts to improve his performance during the next evaluation period.
