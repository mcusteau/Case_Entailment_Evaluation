  The applicant cited Professor Lise Gotell, a professor in the Women's Studies Programme at the University of Alberta as stating that rape is never a genderless crime. This assertion was discarded by the Board, but it is amply supported by Guideline 4. In addition, the documentary evidence before the Board clearly demonstrates that women and girls in Haiti face an elevated risk of violence and rape, a risk that is not similarly experienced by men and boys, even though men and boys can also be victims of rape. Moreover, the number of women raped in Haiti has constantly been increasing over the past months. Many of the victims are single women. Most sexual attacks are committed by men. Moreover, almost half of the women kidnapped are raped. While nearly 50 percent of cases involve minors less than 18 years of age, the Doctors Without Borders Clinic in Port-au-Prince reported that of their 500 rape victims, over half were between 19 and 45 years old.
