  My colleague Justice Pinard, who rendered the judgment of the Court in  
 Dezameau 
 , above, also noted at paragraphs 29 and 31: 
 
 
 
 "This is not to say that membership in a particular social group is sufficient to result in a finding of persecution. The evidence provided by the applicant must still satisfy the Board that there is a risk of harm that is sufficiently serious and whose occurrence is 'more than a mere possibility'. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "As mentioned before, a general risk faced by a particular social group does not preclude a finding of persecution. In other words, a finding that a risk is universally experienced by a social group does not foreclose the inquiry under section 96. The Board foreclosed a proper inquiry into this claim by making an erroneous finding that the risk of violence, specifically rape, is a risk of generalized criminality that all Haitians face."
