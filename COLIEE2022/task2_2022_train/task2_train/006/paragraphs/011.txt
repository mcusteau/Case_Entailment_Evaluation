  The situation of sexual abuse and violence against women in Haiti has recently come to the attention of the Federal Court:  
 Soimin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2009] F.T.R. Uned. 137; 2009 FC 218 ( 
 Soimin 
 );  
 Frejuste v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
