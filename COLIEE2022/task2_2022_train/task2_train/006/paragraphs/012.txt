 [12] 
  The claimant in  
 Soimin 
 , above, feared that she would be kidnapped, raped and tortured should she return to Haiti because of the general crime and violence in her country of origin, since she had travelled abroad and would therefore be perceived as being wealthy. The finding that "[t]he violence feared by the applicant arises from general criminal activity in Haiti, and not the discriminatory targeting of women in particular" ( 
 Soimin 
 , above, at paragraph 14) was not seriously challenged by the claimant.
