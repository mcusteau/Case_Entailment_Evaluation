The expression "other remuneration" is not defined in the Act; it is included in section 5 in the phrase "salary, wages and other remuneration, including gratuities ...". Given its location, I am inclined to give effect to the ejusdem generis rule of interpretation and read "other remuneration" as an amount of the same nature as its antecedents in the sentence, namely "salary" and "wages". They are defined in subsection 248(1) of the Act, but by the express words of that subsection, they have no application to section 5. It therefore becomes necessary to look elsewhere in order to interpret the word "remuneration", for the purposes of section 5. In this respect, I have taken the liberty of quoting from the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (3rd ed.), Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1973:
"remunerate, ... 1. trans. To repay, requite, make some return for (services, etc.) 2. To reward (a person); to pay (a person) for services rendered or work done ... Hence remuneration, reward, recompense, repayment, payment, pay.
"salary, ... 1. Fixed payment made periodically to a person as compensation for regular work; now usu. nonmanual or nonmechanical work (as opp. to wages). 2. [obsolete] Remuneration for services rendered; fee, honorarium...
"wage, ... [1. obsolete] 2. A payment to a person for service rendered; now esp. the amount paid periodically for the labour or service of a workman or servant. Freq. pl. ..." [The square brackets are mine]
These definitions presume compensation for a service rendered.
