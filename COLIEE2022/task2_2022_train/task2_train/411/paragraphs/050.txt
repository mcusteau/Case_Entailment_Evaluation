I therefore allow this appeal and declare that the Accommodation Differential Allowance in the amount of $15,571 paid to the plaintiff by Her Majesty the Queen in the Right of Canada is not taxable; but that the Social Disruption Allowance in the amount of $2,155.41 is to be included in computing the taxpayer's income for 1976. Costs to the plaintiff.
Order accordingly.
