In the case of Roy v. M.N.R., 80 D.T.C. 1005 (T.R.B.), the employer had set up a "redundancy program" under which it paid a substantial sum to the taxpayer over a period of years following his peremptory dismissal. The payments were based on the taxpayer's length of service, salary level, age, number of years to pension age, insurance and so on. The Tax Review Board held at p. 1007:
"The formula under the redundancy fund was carefully calculated and motivated by the company to preclude litigation or threat thereof by an employee who was dismissed. The payments made to the appellant under its redundancy fund were not benefits received by virtue of the contract of employment of the appellant but rather they arose under an arrangement subsequent to the termination of the employment contract."
