Concerning the Social Disruption Allowance, counsel did not press his argument except to stress that the sum failed to compensate adequately for the dislocation and the inconvenience suffered by the plaintiff and his family. He particulary pointed out that the plaintiff's transfer caused his spouse, who had eleven years' experience as a nurse, to give up her job and prospects of advancement with the Department of Veteran Affairs. She was unable to transfer to a comparable hospital in Ontario and remained unemployed for two months. From an administrative position, his wife, unilingual French-speaking, had to return to floor duty; lifting patients in hospital led to a serious injury which has left her semi-invalid.
