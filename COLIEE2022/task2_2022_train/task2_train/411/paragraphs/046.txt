Accordingly, the purpose of paragraph 6(1)(a) is not to impose taxation upon an employee for an amount received by him as reimbursement when it cannot be found in the exemption provisions of paragraph 6(1)(b). Although the Crown relied heavily on the decision in Ransom (supra) suggesting that, if employment gave rise to a payment, it necessarily constituted income unless exempt, counsel failed to point out the true interpretation which NoÃ«l, J., attributed to payments made in these particular types of situations when he wrote at p. 5244:
"An allowance is quite a different thing from reimbursement. It is, as already mentioned, an arbitrary amount usually paid in lieu of reimbursement. It is paid to the employee to use as he wishes without being required to account for its expenditure. For that reason it is possible to use it as a concealed increase in remuneration and that is why, I assume, 'allowances' are taxed as though they were remuneration.
"It appears to me quite clear that reimbursement of an employee by an employer for expenses or losses incurred by reason of the employment (which as stated by Lord MacNaughton in Tenant v. Smith, [1982] A.C. 162, puts nothing in the pocket but merely saves the pocket) is neither remuneration as such or a benefit 'of any kind whatsoever' so it does not fall within the introductory words of section 5(1) or within paragraph (a). It is equally obvious that it is not an allowance within paragraph (b) for the reasons that I have already given."
