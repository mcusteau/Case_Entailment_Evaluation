Though counsel did not address this issue in argument, I am satisfied that the taxpayer has met the evidentiary burden of proof required of him to displace the presumption that the amount he received constituted remuneration under subsection 6(3). On the facts of this case, it cannot be supported:
- that the payment was made to entice the plaintiff "into accepting the office or entering into the contract of employment";
- that it was remuneration or partial remuneration for services;
- that the payment was related to consideration for a convenant undertaken by the employee as to what he was to do or not do, before or after termination of the employment.
