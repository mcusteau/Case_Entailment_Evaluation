This payment, offered to transferring employees, did not arise by virtue of the contract of employment. Its source is the object of a special, collateral arrangement between employer and employee arrived at just prior to the transfer. This arrangement was not part of the terms of employment either before or after; the scheme was designed to indemnify transferring employees for a capital loss and to quell a possible labour relations catastrophe. The payment never arose under the contract of employment nor in relation to services rendered to the employer by the employee; I fail to see how this compensation can, on the face of it, constitute "other remuneration" within the meaning of subsection 5(1) of the Act.
Deemed Remuneration: Subsection 6(3)
