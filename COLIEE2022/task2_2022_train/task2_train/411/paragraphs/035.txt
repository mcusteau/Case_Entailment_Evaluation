The case of Phaneuf Estate v. R., [1978] 2 F.C. 564; 78 D.T.C. 6001 (T.D.), fashioned a test for determining whether a payment constitutes an employment benefit. Thurlow, A.C.J. (as he then was), said at p. 6005 (D.T.C.'s):
"While the language of the Statutes differ, the test expressed by Viscount Cave, L.C. (supra) appears to me to express, as well as it can be expressed, the essence of what falls within the taxing provision of the Income Tax Act. Is the payment made 'by way of remuneration for his services' or is it 'made to him on personal grounds and not by way of payment for his services'? It may be made to an employee but is it made to him as employee or simply as a person. Another way of stating it is to say is it received in his capacity as employee, but that appears to me to be the same test. To be received in the capacity of employee it must, as I see it, partake of the character of remuneration for services. That is the effect that, as it seems to me, the words 'in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of an office or employment' in paragraph 6(1)(a) have."
