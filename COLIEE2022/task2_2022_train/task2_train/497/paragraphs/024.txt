In the case at bar, the applicant presented as part of his new evidence a statement made by Robert Stratton, a fellow member of his unit, which supports the applicant's claim that he was injured in a truck accident while on duty. In a "Statement by Witness" form from the Bureau of Pensions Advocates, Mr. Stratton answers in the affirmative to the question: "Did the applicant ever discuss his physical condition with you?" Asked to provide particulars, he writes,
"Yesâ€“following an accident and injury I saw him sustain while we were riding together in the back of a truck at the Bedford Rifle Range. We were both at that time members of Halifax Rifles Militia. He complained of back pain." (AR, tab 4)
