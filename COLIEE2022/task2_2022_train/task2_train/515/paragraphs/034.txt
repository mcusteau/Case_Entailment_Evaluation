The interest in ensuring a "full and proper hearing" - procedural fairness or natural justice - does not stand alone; it must rather be weighed against competing interests (
Ruby v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police et al.
, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 3; 295 N.R. 353). The right of the respondent to respond fully to the case against him in the context of his application to vacate, in other words, must be weighed against competing interests, most notably, the witness's privacy.
