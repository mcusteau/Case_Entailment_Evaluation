The Supreme Court of Canada has held that the
Privacy Act
has quasi-constitutional status, emphasizing the obligation of government institutions to protect personal information (
Lavigne v. Commissioner of Official Languages (Can.) et al.
, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 773; 289 N.R. 282). Thus, although the
Privacy Act
allows for disclosure of personal information pursuant to an order issued by a Court or other body such as the RPD (see paragraph 8(2)(c)), this exemption should not be liberally construed. Rather, personal information, which has no apparent relevance to the issues underlying the application to vacate, ought not to be readily disclosed.
