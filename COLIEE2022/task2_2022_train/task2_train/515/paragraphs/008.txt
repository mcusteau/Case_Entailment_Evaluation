The applicant submits that the RPD exceeded its power to compel evidence by ordering the summons at issue and, in turn, denying its motion to quash it. Instead, the RPD must strike a balance between the respondent's need to defend himself and the confidentiality of the Minister's file. The summons ordering the production of documents concerning his witness should be as detailed as possible. The documents, if their relevance is contested, should be inspected by the RPD first, unless they are clearly irrelevant.
