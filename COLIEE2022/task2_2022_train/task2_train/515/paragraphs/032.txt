The application to vacate stems from certain declarations made by the respondent's daughter to immigration officials about her (nonexistent) relationship with a Sikh militant. Therefore, only those documents in her immigration file that contain information or past declarations that relate to the same subject matter (or any related factual circumstance with respect to which the respondent may have made an inconsistent statement in the course of obtaining refugee protection) are
clearly necessary
to determine whether the respondent made a material misrepresentation.
