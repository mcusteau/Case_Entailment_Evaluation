Szczecka v. Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration
(1993), 170 N.R. 58; 116 D.L.R.(4th) 333, at 335 (F.C.A.), which Sexton J.A. quoted with approval in
Zündel
, supra, Létourneau J.A. expressed the general rule in these terms:
"...
unless there are special circumstances
there should not be any appeal or immediate judicial review of an interlocutory judgment.
Similarly, there will not be any basis for judicial review, especially immediate review, when at the end of the proceedings some other appropriate remedy exists
. These rules have been applied in several court decisions specifically in order to avoid breaking up cases and the resulting delays and expenses which interfere with the sound administration of justice and ultimately bring it into disrepute. [emphasis added] [references omitted]"
