 Snider, J. 
 : Mr. Jorge Alberto Rodriguez Coitinho, the principal Applicant, is a 40 year old citizen of Uruguay. He came to Canada in 2001 with his wife, adult son and five minor children. The Applicants claim to have a well-founded fear of persecution in Uruguay because of the principal Applicant's and the adult son's perceived political opinion and union membership. The perceived agents of persecution are fellow members of the SUNCA union (Sindicato de la Construccion) who allegedly resorted to extraordinary means to force its members to vote for a political party that was not supported by the principal Applicant and his son.
