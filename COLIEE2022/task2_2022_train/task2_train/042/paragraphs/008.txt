  The documentary evidence that the Board suggests is neutral includes statements made by the SUNCA union President and Secretary-General - leaders of the union whose members the Applicants claim threatened and persecuted them. How can the Board suggest that the SUNCA President and Secretary-General are disinterested in the subject matter of the hearing? On what basis could the Board member imply that these individuals are able to comment objectively and dispassionately on serious allegations against members of the union they represent? When this evidence was put to the principal Applicant at the hearing, he replied: "Well, of course they're not going to accept saying they are threatening." This explanation was not considered and ought to have been if the Board intended to place so much weight on this evidence.
