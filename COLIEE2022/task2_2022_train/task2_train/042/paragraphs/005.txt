  According to the Board, state protection was the determinative issue in the Applicants' claim. The Respondent submits that the Board's decision contains no reviewable error. The Respondent rightly asserts that the Board was entitled to prefer the documentary evidence to that of the Applicants' (Zhou v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immmigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 1087 (F.C.A.) (QL) and that the presumption of a claimant's veracity can be rebutted by documentary evidence that fails to contain any mention of what one would normally expect it to mention (Adu v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1995] F.C.J. No. 114 (F.C.A.) (QL). However, in my view, the reasons of the Board reveal at least two reviewable errors.
