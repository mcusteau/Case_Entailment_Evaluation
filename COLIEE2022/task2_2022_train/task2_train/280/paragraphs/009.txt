The Applicant asserts that there are two points which render the RPD's identity finding unreasonable. First, the Applicant argues that because the RPD found there to be some similarities between the Identity Card and the photograph of the Applicant taken on his entry into Canada, it ought to have engaged an expert to provide an opinion on identity instead of determining on its own that the Applicant was not the individual in the Identity Card. Second, the Applicant asserts that the RPD unreasonably ignored the other photographs in the Record. In this regard, the Applicant filed a copy of what he alleged was his Record of Re-Testing and Re-Assessment, a state-issued card (that contained a blurred photo and purported to speak to the Applicant's credentials as a chef). He also filed a picture of people that he said were his parents with a very young male, but that picture has no names on it.
