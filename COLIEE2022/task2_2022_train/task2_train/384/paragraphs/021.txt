It is fundamental that an applicant has his or her application evaluated under the stated intended occupation. Sharlow, J., underlined the importance of this principle in
Dauz v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 Imm.L.R.(3d) 16; 173 F.T.R. 288, as follows:
"[6] In assessing the occupational factor, the visa officer was required to ask herself what the employment opportunities are in Canada in the occupation:
(a) for which the applicant meets the requirements for Canada as set out in NOC,
(b) in which the applicant has performed a substantial number of the main duties as set out in NOC, including the essential ones; and
(c) that the applicant is prepared to follow in Canada.
. . . . .
"[10] Counsel for the Minister argued that the occupational factor is intended to be merely a measure of occupational demand in Canada. No doubt that is so. But it also asks whether the applicant
meets the employment requirements, and whether the applicant has performed a substantial number of the main duties for the intended occupation.
This part of the regulation on its face requires a determination of facts relating to the applicant, as well as occupational demand in Canada." (emphasis mine)
