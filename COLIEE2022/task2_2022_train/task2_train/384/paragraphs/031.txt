By applying the requirement of a degree equivalent to or substituted for a translation degree, the visa officer confined the scope of employment requirements too narrowly and foreclosed a proper examination on whether the applicant's degree in English language and literature and the courses she followed at the graduate level were connected to her employment as an interpreter. By doing so, the visa officer committed a reviewable error.
