Dr. Chew's approach to the problem was to put in place a correlation review by outside experts to determine if Larsen's complaint of over-condemnation was valid. Dr. Chew and Dr. Frazee discussed this plan and it was agreed that Dr. Frazee would not be involved with final condemnations for two weeks. An e-mail from Dr. Chew to Dr. Frazee and others dated May 6, 2003 reflects the following understanding:
"Dr. Frazee has suggested some short term remedies to address the concerns;
. . . . .
2. That he
(Dr. Frazee) stay off the final condemnations for this week
since the industry is questioning his condemnation rates. I indicated that this should be for two weeks concurrent.
. . . . .
"At the discussion with the RD, Peter and I brought up the possibility of having a national Red Meat expert on condemnation visit Est 150 and perform a correlation review on-site with our veterinarians. This is actively being looked into. We also discussed about the possibility of having Dr. Frazee visit a swine slaughter plant in Ontario or Qu√©bec to perform a 'reverse correlation'. No decision was made on this."
