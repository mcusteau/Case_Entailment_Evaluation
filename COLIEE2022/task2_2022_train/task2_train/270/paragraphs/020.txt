The authorities confirm that not every action taken by an employer that adversely affects an employee amounts to discipline. While an employee may well feel aggrieved by decisions that negatively impact on the terms of employment, the vast majority of such workplace adjustments are purely administrative in nature and are not intended to be a form of punishment. This point is made in
Porter v. Treasury Board (Department of Energy, Mines and Resources)
(1973), 166-2-752 (Lab. Rel. Bd.), in the following passage at page 13:
"The concept of 'disciplinary action' is not sufficiently wide to include any or every action taken by the employer which may be harmful or prejudicial to the interests of the employee. Certainly, every unfavourable assessment of performance or efficiency is harmful both to the immediate interests of the employee and his prospects for advancement. In such cases, it cannot be assumed that the employee is being disciplined. Discipline in the public service must be understood in the context of the statutory provisions relating to discipline."
