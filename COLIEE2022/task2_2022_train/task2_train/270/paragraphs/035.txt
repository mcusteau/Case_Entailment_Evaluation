[35]
While I was invited by the Applicant to direct that the grievance should be dismissed for want of jurisdiction, I am not disposed to go that far. It is not plain and obvious that no jurisdiction could ever be properly assumed in this case. There is some authority indicating that the removal of significant employment responsibilities can constitute a suspension under s. 92 of the
Act
: see
Evans v. Treasury Board (Department of Solicitor General)
(1982), 2 PSSRB 57 and
Guay and Treasury Board (Revenue Canada, Taxation), Re
(1995), 27 PSSRB 10. This would only be the case where an employer left its employee with essentially no useful work to perform. I will say, though, that I do not agree with the Adjudicator that a suspension is established where the employer temporarily takes away an "important part" of an employee's duties. The issue is not what is taken away but, rather, what remains. I have no doubt that an employee left to sit mostly idle at a desk for six weeks has been suspended. In this case, the record does not disclose what, if any, meaningful duties Dr. Frazee retained over the six weeks he was taken off the kill floor and I cannot, therefore, determine whether what occurred amounted to a suspension.
