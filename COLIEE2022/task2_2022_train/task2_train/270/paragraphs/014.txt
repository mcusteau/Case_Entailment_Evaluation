Both the parties to this application characterized the issues under review as matters of mixed fact and law subject to a standard of review of reasonableness simpliciter. They both see the question of what constitutes a disciplinary suspension as requiring the application of relevant facts to a set of defining legal principles. In that sense, they have correctly identified the Adjudicator's task. However, the issue facing the Court on this application is somewhat different. Where a legal issue or the identification of a legal standard going to jurisdiction can be isolated from its factual surroundings, it should be assessed on a standard of correctness: see
Baker Petrolite Corp. et al. v. Canwell Enviro-Industries Ltd. et al.
(2002), 288 N.R. 201; 2002 FCA 158, at para. 51 and
Dynamex Canada Inc. v. Mamona et al.
(2003), 305 N.R. 295; 242 F.T.R. 149; 2003 FCA 248, at para. 45.
