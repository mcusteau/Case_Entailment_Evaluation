The Adjudicator's conclusion that the CFIA's decision to temporarily remove Dr. Frazee from his condemnation inspection duties was disciplinary is supported by only four considerations:
(a) The removal of duties was directed only at Dr. Frazee and not against any of the other CFIA on-site employees;
(b) The allegations of wrongdoing made against Dr. Frazee were repeatedly made;
(c) The CFIA directed Dr. Frazee on four occasions not to perform an important part of his duties within a short period of time;
(d) CFIA managers decided that they could not perform their investigation without suspending Dr. Frazee from an important part of his duties.
