Counsel for the respondent submitted that a question should be certified for purposes of an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. The question as I have reformulated it is:
"Is it necessary for an adjudicator, in conducting an inquiry as to whether an applicant is able to understand and communicate in the language of a hearing, to conduct at least a brief dialogue with an applicant with respect to the subject matter to be dealt with at the hearing in order to comply with the requirements of s. 27(2)(c) of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978?"
