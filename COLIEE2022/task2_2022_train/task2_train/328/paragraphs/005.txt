Following the inquiry, the adjudicator rendered his decision with respect to the issue of the interpreter:
"Adjudicator: The issue Mr. Boateng, is how you can most effectively participate in this proceeding and to use an interpreter of course, you would understand everything better because you would hear everything twice, once in English and once in Twi. But I also have to consider how we can best understand you and I've listened to your answers in English and although you have some accent and you do speak slowly, I feel that I can best understand you and that we can all best understand you without an interpreter being placed between you and ourselves.
"We'll take into consideration the fact that you've asked for an interpreter and we'll take into consideration that if you pause in answering, if you're searching for a word, we'll take into consideration that you may ... you may prefer to testify in Twi.
"But the other matter I have to con ... that I take into consideration is that a Twi interpreter is not going to make your testimony any better than you can make it yourself. If there ... if there's a difficulty in expressing yourself, it may be because of your level of education. We'll also take that into consideration and ... in assessing your evidence. But I ... I ... I don't think that we would have a better hearing with an interpreter and I think an interpreter, in fact would make the hearing worse and it would act as a screen between you and us.
"Now, if you have any difficulty understanding us make sure that you say so. Similarly, if we have any difficulty understanding you we'll ask ... we'll say so. I'll remind you that when you're speaking to keep your voice up.
"Alright. So I ... in my view, an interpreter is not going to make this ... make your evidence any more understandable and in fact, would act as a barrier."
