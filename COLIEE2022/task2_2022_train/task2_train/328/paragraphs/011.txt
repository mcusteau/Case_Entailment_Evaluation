Because the inquiry into the applicant's ability to understand and communicate in English did not consist of a dialogue, relating even in a cursory manner to the subject matter of the hearing, and because the adjudicator took into account irrelevant considerations in making his determination to deny the applicant the services of an interpreter, I am of the opinion that the adjudicator did not comply with the requirements of s. 27(2)(c) of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978, and therefore erred in law.
