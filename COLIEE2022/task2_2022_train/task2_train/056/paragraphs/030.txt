  In reviewing a decision against the reasonableness standard, the Court must consider the justification, transparency and intelligibility of the decision-making process, and whether the decision falls within a range of possible acceptable outcomes which are defensible in light of the facts and the law: see  
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 S.C.R.190 at para. 47, and  
 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Khosa 
 , 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339 at para. 59.
