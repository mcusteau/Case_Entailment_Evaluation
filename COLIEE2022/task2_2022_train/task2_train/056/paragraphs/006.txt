  A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board initially rejected Mr. Kanapathy's refugee claim on the basis that Mr. Kanapathy was excluded from the refugee definition under Articles 1F(a) and 1F(c) of the Refugee Convention. That is, the Board found that there were serious reasons for considering that Mr. Kanapathy was complicit in the commission of a war crime, a crime against humanity, or an act contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.
