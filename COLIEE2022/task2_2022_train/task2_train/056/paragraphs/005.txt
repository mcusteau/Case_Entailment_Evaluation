  Mr. Kanapathy claimed to fear persecution because of his perceived association with the LTTE. He had worked part-time for the  
 Murasoli 
  newspaper in Jaffna, first as a money collector and then as a reporter. Mr. Kanapathy acknowledges that the  
 Murasoli 
  was controlled by the LTTE, and that that the paper printed only stories favourable to it.
