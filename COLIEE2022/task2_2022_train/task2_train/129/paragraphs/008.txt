  The Applicants call the Court's attention to Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [1998] F.C.J. No. 1425 (F.C.T.D.) at para. 17, where Justice Evans noted that "the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency's reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact 'without regard to the evidence'". The Applicants submit that the overlooked evidence is critical to the possible finding that state protection is not available to the Applicants.
