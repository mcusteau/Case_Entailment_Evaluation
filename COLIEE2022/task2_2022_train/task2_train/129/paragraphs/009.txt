  A review of Cepeda-Gutierrez shows that it must be read in context. I note that the reviewable error of the tribunal in Cepeda-Gutierrez was its failure to refer to a personal psychological report filed by the claimant, rather than specific statements out of country condition documents. Indeed, the Court found no error with respect to the tribunal's more general conclusion that the claimant faced no serious possibility of persecution outside Mexico City even though the tribunal apparently did not mention each and every piece of contradicting evidence.
