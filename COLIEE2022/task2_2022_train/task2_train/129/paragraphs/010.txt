  In the case before me, the alleged error relates to omission from the decision of explicit references to certain passages from some of the documentary evidence. Given the circumstances, the Board's assurances that it had considered all of the evidence together with its explicit references to the nature of the contrary evidence was sufficient. The situation falls within the following statement by Justice Evans in Cepeda-Gutierrez, at para. 16: 
 
 
 
 "A statement by the agency in its reasons for decision that, in making its findings, it considered all the evidence before it, will often suffice to assure the parties, and a reviewing court, that the agency directed itself to the totality of the evidence when making its findings of fact."
