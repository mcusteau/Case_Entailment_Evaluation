 [7] 
  Having reviewed the decision as a whole and the documentary evidence referenced by both parties, I am not persuaded that the Board erred. While the decision is disjointed and difficult to follow, looking at the decision as a whole, I cannot conclude that it was patently unreasonable. Although certain specific quotes from the documentary evidence were not explicitly dealt with by the Board in its decision, the Board acknowledged the existence of the evidence setting out a contrary view, with some detail. And the reasons show that the member had an appreciation of that contrary view. In the circumstances, this was adequate. The Board's failure to refer to each and every piece of contrary evidence does not, in this case, warrant the Court's intervention.
