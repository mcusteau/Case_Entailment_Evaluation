  As was carefully demonstrated by counsel for the respondent in his submissions, the new evidence provided by Fairweather is by no means perfect, and some of the concerns with respect to frailties in the evidence will be addressed further on in this decision. Nevertheless, for the purposes of determining the appropriate standard of review, I am satisfied that the new evidence adduced by Fairweather is of sufficient probative significance that the Registrar's decision should be reviewed against the standard of correctness.
