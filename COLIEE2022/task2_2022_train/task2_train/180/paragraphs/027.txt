  I am satisfied that the new evidence provided by Fairweather is of a probative significance such that it would have affected the Registrar's decision. In this regard, it bears repeating that the Registrar's decision was based in part on the finding that Fairweather had not provided evidence showing that any concrete steps had been taken with respect to the use of the TARGET APPAREL mark in the six month period between its acquisition of the mark in the Fall of 2001 and the issuance of the s. 45 Notice in the Spring of 2002.
