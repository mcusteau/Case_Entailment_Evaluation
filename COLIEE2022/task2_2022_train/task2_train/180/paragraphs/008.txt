  Mr. Brener's affidavit recited the circumstances leading up to Fairweather's acquisition of the TARGET APPAREL mark, and explained that at the same time that it acquired the TARGET APPAREL mark from the receiver, Fairweather also acquired over 70 stores employing more than 500 employees. This resulted in the company being extremely busy as it attempted to manage and revitalize the Fairweather stores and assets, and resulted in a delay in the re-launch of TARGET APPAREL merchandise.
