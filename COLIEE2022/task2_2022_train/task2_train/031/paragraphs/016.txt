  Turning to the facts of the present case, I note that, while there has been one day of discovery of one defendant on the remedial question, there are estimated to be three more to go, and discovery of the other parties has not yet started. The discovery required for the remedy of the disgorgement of profits is apt to be particularly time-consuming and expensive for defendants where, as here, they have a number of product lines. The fact that two of the parties are Italian corporations may also involve extra time and expense, in the translation of documents and the attendance of witnesses, for example. The length of time over which the infringements allegedly occurred (nearly 30 years in the case of one defendant, and 10 years in the case of another) also favours bifurcation.
