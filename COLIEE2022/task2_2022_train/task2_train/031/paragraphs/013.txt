  This leads me to the further conclusion that the test formulated by Giles, A.S.P., for determining when discretion should be exercised under rule 107 to postpone remedial questions was too stringent. I do not see in  
 Depuy 
 , or the cases therein cited, a requirement that the production of proof that such an order will  
 necessarily 
  result in a saving of time and expense, although in  
 Pan-American Autolease & Rental Ltd. v. R. 
 , [1985] 1 F.C. 638 (F.C.T.D.), Dub√©, J., approached this standard when he stated that a reference was appropriate if "it appears reasonably certain" that severance would result in a saving of time and expense. However, in my opinion, Giles, A.S.P.'s, test is too close to that disapproved in the more recent case of  
 Depuy 
  and is more restrictive than that formulated in  
 Pan-American 
 .
