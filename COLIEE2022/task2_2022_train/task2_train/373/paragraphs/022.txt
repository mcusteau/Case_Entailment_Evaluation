That is not the end of the matter as the applicant views it, for it is urged that the application in T-1133-92 is now moot anyway, since the applicant's amendment of its Notice of Motion in Court File T-916-92 includes review of the decision to disclose its Proposal. There is no question that the original Notice of Motion in T-916-92 was filed in a timely manner, though it specified only review of the decision to disclose the Record referred to in the correspondence from the Department dated March 3, 1992, that is, "records as to why the idea of tunnel was dismissed in favour of a bridge proposal as one of the options to create a fixed link between P.E.I. and the mainland". It is pointed out that the original Notice of Motion was filed April 21, the same day as the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal was received by the applicant, and that the respondent knew the applicant would seek review of that decision, and thus, was not prejudiced by the amended Notice of Motion. I agree the respondent had notice from the applicant's solicitor, by letter sent by fax on May 4, 1992, that application for review under s. 44(1) was to be undertaken, and clearly from the application in Court File T-1133-92, filed May 15, 1992, the respondent knew that the applicant sought review of the decision. Does the amendment to the Notice of Motion in T-916-92, supported by the Supplementary Affidavit of Mr. Couture, cure the defect of failing to apply within the prescribed time for review of the decision to disclose the proposal?
