[19]
Apparent late filing of an application for review under s. 44(1) of the
Act
, was one reason, among others, expressed by Mr. Justice Strayer in
Schneider (J.M.) Inc. v. Canada
(1986), 8 F.T.R. 119; 12 C.P.R.(3d) 90, at p. 91 (T.D.), in dismissing an application for an extension of time for service and filing, made ex parte to be dealt with in writing under rule 324 of this court's
Rules
. Strayer, J., noted that the
Act
makes no provision for the court to extend the time specified in s. 44(1), and no authority was suggested for the court to grant an extension of time. There the application was dismissed with leave to reapply in a manner to meet the concerns of the court.
