[26]
There are no counterparts, in relation to applications or motions, for rules 424 and 427, which specifically provide for amendment of pleadings, in an action, by leave granted by the court on application for leave to amend. Leave to amend may be effective even after any relevant period of limitation current at the date of commencement of the action has expired, and notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment is to add or substitute a new cause of action, if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment.
