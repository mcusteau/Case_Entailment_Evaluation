Further, I see nothing unfair or improper about the same CBSA officer acting both on the inadmissibility proceedings and the cessation application. In my view, based on the officer's evidence, this is simply a practical administrative arrangement. There is no basis for any assertion that there is a conflict of interest or an improper motive underlying either proceeding, or any unfairness to Mr Li. Nor was there any breach of ethical principles, including any heightened ethical obligations applicable to government counsel. The officer explained that he acted on general instructions to proceed where the evidence supported a
prima facie
case for cessation. He was not, as Mr Li alleged, acting for himself.
