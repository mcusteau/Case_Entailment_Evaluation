The presumption of re-availment is a factual presumption. Proof that someone obtained a passport creates a presumption that the person re-availed himself or herself of the protection of the issuing state. However, as mentioned, it is not the classification of the presumption that really matters. The real question relates to the quantum of evidence required to defeat it.
