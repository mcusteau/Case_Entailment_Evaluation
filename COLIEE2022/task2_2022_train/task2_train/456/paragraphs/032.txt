As for the purpose of bringing the cessation application, it appears likely that Mr Li's file came to the Minister's attention based on Mr Li's criminal offences. Does that make the application improper? I do not believe so. The fact that the circumstances could have (and did) provide the Minister with other recourses (
ie
, inadmissibility proceedings), that, in itself, does not make the cessation application abusive. The question is really whether the application is well-founded on its own merits. Why the Minister chose to make it is, at least on the facts before me, irrelevant.
