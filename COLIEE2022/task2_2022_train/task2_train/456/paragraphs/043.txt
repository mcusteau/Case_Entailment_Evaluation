Mr Li relies on a statement in a legal article on cessation in which the authors state that the "benefit of the doubt must be given to the refugee, as is consistent with the restrictive interpretation appropriate to the cessation clauses" (Joan Fitzpatrick and Rafael Bonoan, "Cessation of Refugee Protection" in Erika Feller, Volker TÃ¼rk and Frances Nicholson, eds,
Refugee Protection in International Law: UNHCR's Global Consultations on International Protection
(New York: Cambridge University Press, 2003) 491 at 525). However, just above that statement, the authors actually cite the UNHCR Handbook which clearly places a legal burden on refugees to rebut the presumption of re-availment on a balance of probabilities. In that context, I take the authors to mean that refugees should be given the benefit of the doubt as to whether they have rebutted the presumption. They do not say that refugees merely have to raise a doubt about re-availment.
