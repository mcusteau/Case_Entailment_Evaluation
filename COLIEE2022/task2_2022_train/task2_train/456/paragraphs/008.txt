The Board rejected Mr Li's contention that the decisions in 2004 to grant him a travel document enabling him to leave Hong Kong for Canada, and to provide him later with a permanent residency card, meant that the Minister could not then seek cessation of his refugee status. Mr Li had argued that, in effect, the Minister was trying to re-litigate the same issues through cessation proceedings. The Board found otherwise; it accepted that there was an overlap of facts, but regarded the two issues as being entirely different. It pointed out that residency, re-availment, and re-establishment are separate concepts.
