 Kashani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 182; [1997] F.C.J. No. 435 (T.D.). The CAIPS notes reveal that the visa officer carefully considered the Applicant's ability to establish a business in Canada: 
 
 
 
 "I HAVE ADVISED SUBJECT THAT MY CONCERN IS HER ABILITY TO ESTABLISH. SHE HAS NOT PRESENTED ME WITH A COMPREHENSIVE IDEA OF WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO IN CDA. I DID HAVE TO PROMPT HER AT TIMES TO GIVE ME SPECIFIC INFO ABOUT HOW, WHERE, HOW MUCH IT WILL COST, ETC. AND SHE HAS SAID, AT TIMES, THAT SHE STILL HAS TO LOOK INTO OR RESEARCH THE IDEA MORE IN CDA. SHE HAS NOT MADE AN ATTEMPT TO BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH THE MODELING [sic] ENVIRONMENT IN CANADA, SHE CONFIRMED SHE HAS NOT CONTACTED ANY ASSOCIATIONS, UNIONS ETC. 
 
 
 
 "HER BUSINESS PROPOSAL IS VERY GENERAL AND HER ESTIMATES ARE VAGUE
