  A PRRA officer is not a quasi-judicial body, nor does he or she have an appellate function when faced with a RPD decision. The PRRA officer is an employee of the Minister, acting within his or her employer's discretion (insofar as it is circumscribed by the Act and the Regulations). The PRRA officer must give deference to the RPD's determination of the claim, to the extent that the facts remain unchanged from the time it had rendered its decision. Instead, the PRRA officer is specifically looking as to whether  
 new 
  evidence has come to life since the RPD's rejection of the claim for determining a risk of persecution, a danger of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The underlying rationale for paragraph 113( 
 a 
 ) of the Act is not appellate in nature but rather to assure the claimant has a last chance to have any new risks of refoulement (not previously assessed by the RPD) assessed before removal can take place.
