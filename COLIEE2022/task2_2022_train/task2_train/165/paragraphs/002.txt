  Mr. Parminder Singh seeks judicial review of a decision by the RAD, dated September 26, 2013, whereby it confirmed the decision of the RPD that he is neither a  
 Convention 
  refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 [Act] nor a person in need of protection under its subsection 97(1). In its analysis of the RPD decision, the RAD applied the reasonableness standard; it considered its mandate essentially akin to that of this Court when undertaking a judicial review of a RPD decision.
