The defendant claims bank interest, in the amount of $90,337.00 as a cost item. The loans are Tye-Sil's. Mr. Wiener would allocate a portion of those loans to the Homeware Division by reference to the percentage of capital employed by that Division. He would then apply his base year approach and allocate a portion of the interest on this amount to the convertible rowers (100% in 1985, 54.97% in 1986 and 16.25% in 1987). This would result in: interest of $6,984.00 being allocated as a cost of manufacturing and selling the rowers in 1985; $46,497.00 in 1986; and $36,856.00 in 1987.
