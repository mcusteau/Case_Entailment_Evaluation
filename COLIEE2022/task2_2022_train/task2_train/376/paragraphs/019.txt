Insofar as the amounts claimed on account of export duties and destroyed inventory are concerned, these can be easily dealt with. There is absolutely no evidence that the defendant paid any amount on account of the export duties which it claims as an expense. Indeed, counsel did not even attempt to make argument on this point. The referee was clearly right in not allowing this item. The destroyed inventory comprised infringing rowers which were returned to the defendant, or which the defendant could not sell, as a result of this court's order of July 30, 1987. (The order which found the rowers to be infringements of the plaintiffs' patent.) In disallowing this item, Mr. Preston followed the principle set out by Mr. Justice Addy in the Teledyne case, supra, at pages 217-218. The application of that principle dictates that the inventory which is destroyed as a result of an order finding it to infringe patent rights should not be considered a deductible cost. This follows because the expenditures relating to those rowers do not relate to the earning of any money for which the defendant is liable to account for the plaintiffs. The amount in question was properly excluded by Mr. Preston from the accounting of profits.
