The plaintiffs' motion is based on the fact that the appeal from Mr. Preston's report was complex, time consuming, detailed and required a review of much of the evidence which had been placed before Mr. Preston. Counsel argues that the defendant's solicitors defined the scope of the appeal in the broadest possible terms, by objecting to the Referee's Report in its general aspects as well as its details. He argues that the approach was to appeal virtually every significant finding of Mr. Preston, and to reargue the evidence again.
