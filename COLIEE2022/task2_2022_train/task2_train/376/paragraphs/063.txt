Counsel for the defendant objects to this award of costs. He argues that the defendant cannot be faulted for not having produced the documents prior to November 23, 1989. It was not until that date that the defendant's expert prepared his evidence and that the relevance of the documents in question surfaced. He argues that the discovery days were not wasted; they would have been required regardless of when the documents were produced. With respect to the solicitor client award for December 8, 1989, he argues that the plaintiffs should only be given one-half day because the reference resumed around 2 p.m. that afternoon, when the plaintiffs withdrew their objection to the introduction of the documents. The proceedings, apparently, had been adjourned late in the morning of the same day in response to the defendant's request for an adjournment.
