The two broad categories of costs to be deducted from revenues, then, are direct costs and common costs specifically incurred as a result of the production and sale of the rowers. These were described as follows:
(a)
Direct Costs
, are costs that can be directly tied to a specific unit of production or with a specific activity required solely for the manufacture and sale of the infringing product; and
(b)
Common Costs
, otherwise known as indirect costs, are costs incurred for the benefit of two or more products or services. (Common costs are generally
not deducted
in calculating net profit when using a differential method of accounting, except for particular items of common costs that can be shown to have increased specifically for the production and sale of the infringing product, in which case an allocation of a prorated portion of the common costs may be deducted from revenue to calculate net profit.)
