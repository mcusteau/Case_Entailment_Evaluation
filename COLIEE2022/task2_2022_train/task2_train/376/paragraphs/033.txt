With respect to the costs associated with the production of samples and prototypes, the plaintiffs' expert initially proposed to Mr. Preston that an amount for this type of expense be allowed. However, the evidence before Mr. Preston established that one employee in the Homeware Division looked after all samples and prototypes for the division and that the expense relating to his salary had not increased as a result of the manufacturing and sale of the rowers. The amount originally suggested as appropriate was thus deleted.
