The other Homeware products which were chosen to be added to the infringing rowers, in order to get a sample for comparison to the gross profit percentage figure (which had been obtained from the financial statements and general ledgers) were "best seller" items. The rowers together with these other "best sellers" comprised 70% of the products manufactured and sold by the Homeware Division. "Best sellers" are those items which account on a product category basis for the largest amounts of revenue. Mr. Wiener subtracted the cost of material and labour which he took from the production cost sheets from the net sales revenue for these products. Thus, a profit figure for these was calculated which allegedly did not include any direct ancillary costs. From this a profit percentage figure as a ratio of profit to material and labour costs was obtained. These were calculated to be 46.51%, 41.74% and 35.32%, for the years 1985, 1986 and 1987 respectively. Mr. Wiener asserts that the ancillary direct costs should, then, be determined by calculating the difference between the gross profit percentage, which he calculated from the financial statements and general ledgers, and the profit percentage he calculated from the production cost sheets. This it is argued gives one the ancillary direct costs as a percentage of sales.
