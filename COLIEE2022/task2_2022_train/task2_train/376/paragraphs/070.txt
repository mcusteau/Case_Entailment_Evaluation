At the same time, I have been persuaded that the nature of this appeal is such, that an amount above that allowed by the tariff should be awarded with respect to preparation time. The plaintiffs' counsel prepared and filed a factum in response to the defendant's 80 page factum, which was more than 70 pages long. That factum necessarily dealt extensively with the facts which were in issue. A number of the issues, including ancillary costs, and various common costs, were commented on by virtually all witnesses, particularly King, Nadler, Wiener, Belbeck and Gayler. The evidence of each had to be isolated and compared to the other versions in preparation for the appeal. The plaintiffs had to deal with twenty-two issues. In addition, there was substantial argument on the law, including analysis of the case law respecting appeals from the Prothonotary.
