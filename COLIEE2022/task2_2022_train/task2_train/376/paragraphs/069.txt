I accept counsel for the defendant's argument that references to fix damages or accounting of profits are usually lengthy and technical. Appeals from such are likely to be of a similar nature. I agree that this was known when the amendments were made to Tariff B in 1987 and yet no special provisions treating such appeals differently from other types of appeals when taxing costs were promulgated. I am mindful also that much of the argument presented to me was a repeat of what had been presented to Mr. Preston.
