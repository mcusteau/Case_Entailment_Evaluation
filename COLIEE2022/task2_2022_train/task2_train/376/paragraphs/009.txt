In the circumstances of the present case, to allow the defendant to deduct costs attributable proportionally to the operation of the total business of the Homeware Division, including a share of the general office and management costs, regardless of whether or not those costs would have been incurred had the manufacture and sale of the infringing product not taken place, would constitute an unjust enrichment of the defendant. It would not give an accurate picture of the profit which the defendant actually obtained from the manufacture and sale of the infringing rowers.
