[44]
The plaintiff's expert, Mr. Belbeck, attempted some allocation of common costs, working from the financial statements and general ledgers but with respect to many categories of expense, he did not allocate any amount. He did not feel he had enough information available to do so. In this case of "factory expenses", for example, Mr. Belbeck wrote, at page 19 of his affidavit:
"The defendant has not provided any explanation or proof as to what expenses were grouped under this common cost expense within the general ledger, and we can only conclude that there was no increase in costs as a result of production of the infringing units."
The defendant, during the reference, through Mr. Nadler, provided some explanation of this category of expense but no attempt was made to identify the fixed cost component thereof. It is clear from Mr. Nadler's evidence that a significant portion, if not all, of the expenses covered by this category were not incurred in order to produce the infringing rowers. He described the heading as a "catch-all" category which accumulates all the costs of running the factory - "a multitude of different things". He gave as an example "if the furnace broke down in the building it would go under factory expense".
