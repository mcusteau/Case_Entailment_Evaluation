While counsel continually argued that it was impossible to do what the differential accounting approach required, in order to obtain a reasonable estimate of actual costs, no convincing expert accounting evidence was adduced to substantiate that position. Indeed, Mr. Belbeck when questioned about the allocation of common costs relating to postage stated:
"The external financial statements of a particular company would never give the information you'd need to do that. However, if access was given to all the books and records of a particular company you could reconstruct how much was incurred for postage of particular products. It would be a long and tedious job and I did not have the information available to me to make that allocation." (transcript page 263)
