The objective sought to attained, by allowing the plaintiff to elect an award based on an accounting of the defendant's profits, is to require the defendant to pay to the plaintiffs
all of the profits
earned from the manufacture and sale of the infringing product. If the defendant can produce the product more profitably than the plaintiff, the plaintiff is entitled to the whole of that profit. At the same time a plaintiff is not required to accept a lesser amount than it could have made itself. In such a case, an election of damages is available.
