Counsel for the plaintiffs points out that the documents, as well as comprising many which the plaintiffs had expressly asked for on discovery, comprised 60% of the documents relied upon by the defendant. They included documents such as the financial statements and general ledgers for 1984, the production cost sheets for the additional products (of the 70% best sellers) on which Mr. Wiener based his ancillary cost approach, auditors working papers for 1985, 1986 and 1987. Not only were the documents new to the plaintiffs but the concept of the defendant's argument, based as it was on the ancillary cost approach and the base year approach, was new to the plaintiffs.
