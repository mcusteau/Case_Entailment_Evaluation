With respect to the amount which should be allocated for scrap, obsolete components and shrinkage, the defendant's production sheets added a 3% factor for "waste". Counsel for the defendant argues that this should only be considered as referrable to waste on account of scrap, not including obsolescence and shrinkage. Mr. Preston accepted the plaintiffs' argument that the 3% should be interpreted as covering the three categories. The plaintiffs buttressed their position, in this regard, by pointing out that their experience in manufacturing the same machine led them to conclude that a 3% wastage factor on account of scrap, obsolescence and shrinkage was appropriate. The plaintiffs also noted that their scrap expenses should be greater than the defendant's. The plaintiffs manufacture many of the component parts for the rowers themselves while the defendant purchases its component parts. With respect to obsolete components, it should also be noted that the defendant's practice was to phase out the usage of any such part, whenever possible, by making a change to a new part only after the existing inventory of the old part had been used. In the case of costs resulting from shrinkage, these were reported on the cardex cards and a precise figure, in this regard, could have been calculated by the defendant had it chosen to do so. There is no reason to think that costs incurred as a result of scrap, obsolete components and shrinkage were not adequately accounted for by Mr. Preston's acceptance of the 3% figure.
