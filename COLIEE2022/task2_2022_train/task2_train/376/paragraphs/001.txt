Reed, J.
: The appellant (defendant) brings a motion to have the referee's report of March 15, 1990, set aside, varied or altered. The respondents (plaintiffs) bring a motion to have that report confirmed and judgment entered in accordance therewith. The report assesses the amount payable, by the defendant to the plaintiffs, as profits earned by the defendant from the sale of "convertible rowers". Convertible rowers are a type of exercise equipment. The manufacture and sale of that equipment, by the defendant, was held to be an infringement of the plaintiff's patent, number 1,185,631.
