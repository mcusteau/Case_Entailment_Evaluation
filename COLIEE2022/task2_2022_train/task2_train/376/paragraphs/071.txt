Accordingly an increase in the tariff will be allowed with respect to the costs of preparation. Senior counsel will be allowed to claim up to $500.00 per day for each three and one-half days ($ 1750.00) and junior counsel will be entitled to claim up to $300.00 per day for each three and one-half days ($ 1050.00). I note that the defendant does not contest the plaintiffs' entitlement to reimbursement for all reasonable disbursements paid in respect of the hearing of the appeal in Montreal. In all other respects, the plaintiffs' request for increased costs is denied.
Order accordingly.
