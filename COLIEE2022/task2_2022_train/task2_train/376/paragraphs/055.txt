The plaintiffs note that the defendant's treatment of the interest expense item gives surprising results. As between 1985 and 1987, the sales of infringing rowers decreased by 30%, yet the defendant's method of cost assessment would allocate nearly a 600% increase in interest expense to 1987 over 1985. Similarly infringing rower sales decreased from 1986 to 1987, by approximately 30%, but the interest sought to be charged shows no comparable reduction. Mr. Belbeck's evidence with respect to bank interest was:
"This is a common cost but there is no proof that there was any increase in this cost specifically related to manufacture and sale of the infringing units. In fact, the increase in this expense from 1985 to 1987 appears to be partly due to operating losses in Tye-Sil's other divisions."
Mr. Preston allowed no cost allocation for bank interest. He concluded his report on common costs as follows:
"I have given an allowance for common costs that in my submission actually contributed to the sums received for the sale of the infringing units. The defendant was not able to prove to my satisfaction that any portion of the other common costs listed by its expert witness increased as a result of the production and sale of the infringing units. Because of this failure to prove, any doubt I may have, has been resolved in favour of the plaintiff."
