It is clear that, the profit which a defendant can make from the manufacture and sale of an infringing product will vary with the particular circumstances of the defendant's business. A prospective defendant who has excess production capacity (unused warehouse space, underused machinery or underemployed personnel) would find the manufacture and sale of an infringing product more profitable than would a defendant who had to incur additional fixed costs before such manufacture and sale could take place. In addition, a defendant who is already in the same business as the potential plaintiff, may find many additional costs to be minimal in nature. For example, selling and advertising costs, might involve no more than the addition of a description of the infringing item to an existing sales catalogue. The infringing product could be added, as merely one among many which salesmen would discuss with prospective purchasers when travelling for selling purpose. Indeed, one can speculate that a potential infringer who is operating from a position of excess productive capacity and is in the same business as the plaintiff, could afford to be more careless about potential infringement than could a manufacturer who was not in that position.
