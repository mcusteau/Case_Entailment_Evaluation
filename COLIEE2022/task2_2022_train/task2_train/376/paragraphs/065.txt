Mr. Preston, having sat through the reference with all its detailed evidence is in a better position than I to judge the amount of discovery time wasted as a result of the defendant's conduct. Also, he is better able to judge how much time was wasted on December 8, 1989, as a result of the defendant's motion to have the documents admitted. I would note, however, that it is not only the time during which the reference was adjourned which would have been wasted in that proceeding. The time required for argument on the admissibility of the documents, the time required by Mr. Preston to prepare a ruling, as well as the subsequent request for and granting of an adjournment all were unnecessary procedures occasioned by the defendant's conduct.
