Officer Bauly heard nothing by the 16th day of April. On that date she telephoned one of the solicitors for the Applicants. In a telephone conversation, she reconfirmed her willingness to receive written submissions, but indicated later the same day that a conference call would not be necessary for the purposes of the review. A copy of Dr. Golda's report (and apparently not a copy of Dr. Peer's report) was transmitted the same day by fax to Officer Bauly. The report was passed on to the attending Canada Immigration physician for his review. His advice was to the effect that Dr. Golda's report failed to establish sufficient medical reasons to allow the Applicants to apply for landed status from within Canada. No meeting took place and no teleconference was held involving the Canada Immigration official and physician and Dr. Golda and the Applicants solicitors.
