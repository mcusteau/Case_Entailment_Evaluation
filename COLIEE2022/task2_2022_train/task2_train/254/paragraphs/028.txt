The change in policy in 1989 is further set out in the affidavit in the
Kwon
case. It is alleged that sometime in 1989, Undertaking of Assistance Forms were made available to the public in response to litigation without requiring an R-2 letter so that an applicant could bypass the prescreening process and file I.M.M.8 and 1344 Forms simultaneously. At the same time, however, the Department changed its former policy of "locking in" the points as of the date of filing of the initial demand and paying the prescribed fee, when both forms were not filed simultaneously.
