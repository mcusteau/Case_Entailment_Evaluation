Respondent refers to the case of
Distribution Canada Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue
(1990), 39 F.T.R. 127, a Customs case, in which Strayer, J., reviewed the jurisprudence relating to the issue of mandamus. At page 131 he states:
"It is true that mandamus is available in appropriate cases to require enforcement of the law. It appears to me, however, that a distinction has generally been drawn in the jurisprudence between a court requiring a public officer to enforce the law in cases where he has completely failed to do so, on the one hand, and a court telling a public officer how to enforce it on the other."
