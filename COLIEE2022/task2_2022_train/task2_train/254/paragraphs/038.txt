In the as yet unreported case of
Choi v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, A-851-90, the judgment dated December 13, 1991, refers to the above quotation and MacGuigan, J.A., states "Any other date except the date of application would be purely arbitrary as a 'lock-in' date for the occupational demand factor, depending on the variances of the administrative process. The application date is the only date within the control of the applicant, and is consequently the only date that can be established without arbitrariness."
