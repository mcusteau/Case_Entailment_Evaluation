In cases where the independent applicant indicates that he has relatives who will provide the necessary Assisted Relative Undertaking of Assistance Form 1344, it might perhaps be argued that it is the date of receipt of this second form which should govern. Now that these Forms are readily available, frequently they are filed simultaneously. It is very significant to note however that the payment is made with the initial application, no further fee being charged when the Assisted Relative Form is received.
