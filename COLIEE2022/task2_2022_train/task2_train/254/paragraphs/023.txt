It is conceded that occupational demand will vary from time to time, and that it is considered on the basis of the country as a whole, and not of the area in which the applicant proposes to settle. Thus the points to be allotted under this heading can be substantially reduced between the time of the initial application and the time it is screened (or of course in some cases increased). This is not disputed. There was some argument as to whether the allotment of zero points for a given occupation represents a permissible allocation of points since the assessment must be based on "the number of units of assessment for each factor" according to Schedule I and the allotment should therefore be somewhere between one and ten, zero not being a number. This was not strongly urged, however, and certainly one can conceive of occupations for which there is no demand whatsoever, for which it would be appropriate to award zero points (or more precisely units of assessment).
