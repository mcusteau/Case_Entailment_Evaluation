Justice MacGuigan in
Choi
states with respect to provision of Forms:
"This does not imply that Canadian authorities must provide a detailed exegesis of Canadian immigration law and procedures, or legal advice to prospective immigrants as to the legal significance of available options but it does mean that the immigration authorities have an obligation in fairness to provide basic information on the methods of application, and to make available the appropriate forms."
