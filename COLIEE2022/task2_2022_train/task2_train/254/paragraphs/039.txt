Respondent refers to the case of
Mohammed v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, 14 Imm. L.R.(3d) 104, which however dealt with a case where the application had been delayed in the mail and meanwhile applicant's point entitlement had been reduced so he no longer qualified (although there is some doubt as to whether he would have qualified in any event). It is not authority for the proposition that it is not the date of receipt of the application which must be applied. In fact Rouleau, J., at page 109 states clearly "I am of the view that there is no lack of fairness in the department's policy of assessing occupational demand as of the date that the application is received."
