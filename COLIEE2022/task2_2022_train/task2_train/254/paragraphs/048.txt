The
Choi
case has pointed out the unfairness and uncertainty of this policy. Certainly with respect to assisted relative applications the visa officer clearly cannot issue a visa until the undertaking has been received, but I do not conclude that this prevents an assessment based on the points available as of the date of the initial application and payment of the one-time fee. The interview as to suitability to assess points for this can also take place. The delay for issuing a visa before receiving the AR 1344 Form is merely a suspensive condition.
