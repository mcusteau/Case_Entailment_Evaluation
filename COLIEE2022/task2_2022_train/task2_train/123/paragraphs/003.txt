  The applicant is a physiotherapist and worked at the University Hospital in Plovdiv. She claims that she has suffered persecution as a result of the Bulgarian authorities' (the local police) disapproval of her husband's activities. The applicant's husband, who fled Bulgaria in December 1989, was a surgeon and an avid target shooter. In the early 1980's the husband attended many target shooting competitions and associated with foreigners. The authorities became aware of his association with foreigners in 1981 and began to harass him and the applicant. At least twice a year the authorities would search their house looking for firearms. It is or was illegal for citizens of Bulgaria to possess firearms.
