  In  
 Bains v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1993), 63 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.), I stated at page 2 of that decision [original]: 
 
 
 
 "However, in making a finding of what was plausible or implausible the Refugee division made no reference to the documentary evidence filed in support of the applicant ... Therefore, in my view, the failure to comment on the evidence filed, either in a negative or positive manner, seriously weakened the Refugee Division's decision and conclusions." 
 
 
 
 Further, at page 5 I continued: 
 
 
 
 "The second issue raised by the applicant is that although three pieces of documentary evidence directly specific to the applicant were introduced ... the Refugee Division made no mention of this documentation in their decision. Once again, I am concerned that no mention of this documentation is made in the reasons. I agree that it is within the purview of the panel to review the documentation and accept or reject the information, however, the Refugee Division cannot simply ignore the information ... The Refugee Division, in my view, is obligated, at the very least, to comment on the information. If the documentation is accepted or rejected the applicant should be advised of the reasons why, especially as the documentation supports the applicant's position."
