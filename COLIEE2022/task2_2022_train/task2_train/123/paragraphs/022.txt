  It is also clear that a court can review and set aside a board's evidentiary findings under circumstances provided for in s. 18.1(4) of the  
 Federal Court Act 
 . The question is whether the Board made an error sufficient to be caught under s. 18.1(4). In  
 Singh and Narang v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1993), 69 F.T.R. 142 (T.D.), Reed, J., indicated that a board's findings of fact can be reviewed under two different circumstances. First, the findings could be reviewed where there was no evidence presented that would support those findings. Second, even if there was some evidence to support those findings they might still be reviewable if, on an assessment of the evidence as a whole, those findings were unreasonable.
