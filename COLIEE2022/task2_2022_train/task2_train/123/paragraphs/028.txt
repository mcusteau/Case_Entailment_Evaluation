  Although it is not clear that the Board's findings would have been different it might still have been possible, based on this final piece of circumstantial evidence, for the Board to have found (1) that there was police involvement in the accident and the prior attacks upon the applicant and her son and (2) that the police were still actively seeking the applicant. If these findings were made it might have then led the Board to conclude that there was evidence of past persecution. This evidence, in conjunction with the fact that the police were still looking for the applicant and her son, may well have been enough to show that there was a potential objective fear on the part of the applicant. The police actions seem to be more private than political and, as the Board found, there had been no State complicity. Therefore, the applicants would still have to establish that the State was either unable or unwilling to protect them from the local police. Given the fact that there was no finding of persecution it is probable that none thought to consider this particular point.
