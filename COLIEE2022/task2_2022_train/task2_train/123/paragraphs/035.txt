  Certainly, it does not look like the treatment the applicant suffered, (i.e., the transfer in jobs, increased scrutiny of her new supervisor or the bi-annual searches for firearms) can even come close to this definition of persecution. Therefore, the applicants' arguments that the Board failed to apply the correct test to persecution cannot be supported. It must be remembered that the Board found that the attacks on the applicant were  
 not 
  carried out by the police so they cannot be calculated into the (past experience=persecution) equation. Had the Board found that there had been police involvement and that the police were still seeking the applicant and her son it might well have found the treatment to be persecution within the meaning of the above definition.
