  There is not, in my opinion, anything in the Board's decision that amounts to a finding which can be classified as perverse or capricious. That is, the Board's findings can generally be viewed as reasonable. Indeed, to the credit of the claimant, the Board determined: "The panel accepts most of the claimant's evidence as credible, and also finds that the claimant has a subjective fear of persecution". (p. 4 of the reasons). Also, they believed her evidence about the miscarriage: "It is indeed tragic that because of the stress caused by such situation [the searches], the claimant suffered a miscarriage". They accepted as a fact that the stress was significant and that a miscarriage occurred.
