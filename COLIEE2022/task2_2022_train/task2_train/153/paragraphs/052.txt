  My conclusion regarding the reasonableness of the RPD's decision is reinforced by the fact that the state did in fact respond to each of the three allegedly persecutory acts relied upon by the Applicants to advance their claims for refugee protection. With respect to the abuse that the principal Applicant's son and other Roma children suffered at their school, the local government hired security guards. No evidence was adduced to suggest that this was not an adequate response. With respect to the attack that occurred in December 2008, the police did attend on the scene and cause the masked assailants to flee before inflicting any serious injuries on any of the Applicants. With respect to the demonstration held by skinheads and members of the Hungarian Guard on March 15, 2009, the principal Applicant testified that the police were present in riot gear. In addition, country documentation included at pages 115 of the Applicant's Record and 156-157 of the Certified Tribunal Record indicate that, at the time of publication, (i) there was an ongoing police investigation into the throwing of Molotov cocktails at Roma homes which occurred shortly after that demonstration, (ii) police had initiated legal proceedings against 16 members of the Hungarian Guard for violating the ban on participating in any event of a legally disbanded organization, and (iii) police arrested more than 70 members of the Hungarian Guard at demonstrations in 2010 that appear to be similar to the one that occurred on March 15, 2009.
