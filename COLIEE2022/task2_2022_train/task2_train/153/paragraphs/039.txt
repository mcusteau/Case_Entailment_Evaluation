  The Applicants submitted that  
 Karaseva 
 , above, is distinguishable on the basis that, in the present case, there was "total inaction" by the police, whereas in  
 Karaseva 
 , the police did get involved, but ultimately did not pursue the matter in question because the applicant could only provide information regarding the colour of the perpetrator's jacket and pants. I disagree. In my view, the two cases are not materially distinguishable on this point. In  
 Karaseva 
 , above, the applicant was questioned by police following the stabbing of her fianc√©, whereas here, the police attended at the scene of the attack and then declined to take further action at that time and again the following day, because the assailants had fled and could not be identified.
