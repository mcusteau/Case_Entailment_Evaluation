  The Applicants submit that the RPD erred by: 
 
 
 
 i. concluding that the discriminatory treatment to which they were personally subjected, and to which people of Roma ethnicity in general are subjected in Hungary, does not rise to the level of "persecution"; and 
 
 
 
 ii. unduly focusing on the efforts of the state to provide protection to its Roma citizens, rather than on the operational adequacy of those efforts.
