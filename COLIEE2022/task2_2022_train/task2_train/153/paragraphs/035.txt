  It is against the backdrop of the foregoing principles that I will now return to the RPD's decision. At paragraph 9 of its decision, after identifying the nexus issue of persecution, the RPD stated: "As well, the Panel has also considered whether or not there is adequate state protection in Hungary, whether the claimants took all reasonable steps to avail themselves of that protection, and whether they have provided clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect them." At paragraphs 21 and 22 of its decision, after elaborating upon the latter two principles, the RPD characterized them as being "directly on point" in this case. After dealing with the persecution versus discrimination issue, the RPD then proceeded to conclude that the Applicants had failed to provide sufficient "objective evidence in the material aspects of these claims and,  
 alternatively 
 , the availability of state protection" (my emphasis).
