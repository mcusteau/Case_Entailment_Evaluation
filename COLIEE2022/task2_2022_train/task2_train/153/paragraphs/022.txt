  The standard of review applicable to the RPD's assessment of the issue of state protection depends on whether the conclusion reached by Board turned on its understanding of the proper test for state protection or on its application of that test to the facts of this case. For essentially the same reasons discussed at paragraphs 20 and 21 above, the former would be reviewable on a standard of correctness (see also  
 Koky 
   
 v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 1407, at para 19 [ 
 Koky 
 ]), whereas the latter would be reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. In short, the jurisprudence has established a clear test for state protection (see, e.g.,  
 Burai v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2013 FC 565, at para 28 [ 
 Burai 
 ];  
 Lakatos v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2012 FC 1070, at paras 13-14;  
 Kaleja v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 668, at para 25; and  
 Cosgun v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 400, at paras 42-52). Therefore, it is not open to the RPD to apply a different test, and the issue of whether the RPD applied the proper test would be reviewable on a standard of correctness. However, the issue of whether the RPD erred in applying the settled law to the facts in this case would be a question of mixed fact and law that is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness (
