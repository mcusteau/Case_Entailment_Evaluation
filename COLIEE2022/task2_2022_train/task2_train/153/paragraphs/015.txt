  The Applicants raised the following two issues with respect to the RPD's decision: 
 
 
 
 i. Did the RPD err by failing to provide adequate reasons for its conclusions that (i) the treatment to which he, his spouse and their children were subjected in Hungary was discriminatory, but not persecutory, in nature; and (ii) the general treatment to which people of Roma ethnicity in Hungary are subjected also does not reach the level of persecution? 
 
 
 
 j. Did the RPD err in reaching its conclusion with respect to state protection in Hungary?
