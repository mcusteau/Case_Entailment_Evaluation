  The following day, Mr. Ruszo and his spouse went to the police station to report the incident. However, when Mr. Ruszo was unable to identify his assailants, he and Mrs. Ruszo were told that charges could not be pressed against unknown persons. The police then smiled at them and took no further action. As a result of that response, Mr. and Mrs. Ruszo did not further pursue the matter.
