  In December 2008, Mr. Ruszo, his cousin and one of his sons were attacked by a group of skinheads while waiting for a bus. As they were being beaten and kicked on the ground, they screamed for help. The police were alerted, and as they approached the scene, the skinheads, who had scarves around their faces, fled. After confirming that they had not sustained any serious injuries, the police drove off.
