The Board found a number of implausibilities and contradictions in the evidence given by the Applicant, and drew its adverse credibility conclusion on that basis. Counsel for the Applicant attempted to reargue the same arguments that were previously presented to the Board, and basically asked this Court to reweigh the evidence in order to come to a different conclusion. But it is well established that paragraph 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Court Act does not authorize the Court to substitute its view of the facts for those of the Board, which sees and hears the witnesses and which also has expertise in assessing the evidence relating to the facts that are within its area of specialized knowledge (Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1998] F.C.J. No. 1425 (F.C.). As my colleague Snider J. said in Sinan v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2004] F.C.J. No. 188:
"The Applicants have put forward alternative explanations for many of the Board's findings. When the standard of review is, as here, one of patent unreasonableness, it is not sufficient to present an alternative line of reasoning - even where that may present a reasonable explanation. What the Applicants must do is to point to a conclusion of the Board that is not supportable in any way on the evidence. The Applicants have failed to persuade me that any of the most significant findings were patently unreasonable. I cannot conclude that the decision as a whole is patently unreasonable."
