In reaching this conclusion, I am also taking into consideration that the Applicant had been in Canada for almost three years when the refugee hearing took place, and therefore had ample opportunity to get in touch with her relatives and friends in Cameroon to obtain the relevant documents. Moreover, she was represented by counsel and the letter from the Board inviting her to produce the appropriate documents and other type of exhibits was sent to her some nine months prior to the interview. In those circumstances, I fail to see how the Applicant can successfully establish that she has been denied a fair hearing and that the Board has breached the principles of natural justice because she was not given a fair opportunity to produce the missing documents substantiating her claim before a decision was made.
