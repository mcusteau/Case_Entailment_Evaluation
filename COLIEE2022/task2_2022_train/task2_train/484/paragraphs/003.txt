The Applicant alleges that on March 4, 2004, a fire broke out at the camp where her husband was on guard. Her husband told her that the fire may have been a possible coup d'Ã‰tat. She adds that her husband was a member of the Social Democratic Front (SDF), which was the largest opposition political party at the time of the fire. When her husband went back to the military camp, after having returned home for a couple of hours, she says he was questioned by his superior about the fire.
