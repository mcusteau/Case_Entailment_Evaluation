Simpson, J., examined a similar scenario in
Lawther v. 424470 B.C. Ltd.
(1995), 95 F.T.R. 81; 60 C.P.R.(3d) 510 (T.D.):
"This court has no jurisdiction to entertain a dispute which is solely a matter of contract. However, it will entertain an action which involves a contractual dispute, if the action primarily concerns a patent, trade mark or copyright:
Titan Linkabit Corp. v. S.E.E.
See
Electronic Engineering Inc.
(1992), 44 C.P.R. (3d) 469 at p. 472, 58 F.T.R. 1; 35 A.C.W.S.(3d) 416 (T.D.). In this case, the pleadings disclose that the principal issue is whether or not the plaintiff is entitled, in Canada, to a reassignment of the Patent. The defendant alleges that the plaintiff was offered an option to reacquire the patent but that the plaintiff refused to pay the agreed price and that the option has lapsed. The central issue would seem to be the nature of the option agreement and whether or not the parties have complied with its terms.
"
In my view, the determination of this contractual issue will dictate ownership of the patent and the appropriate relief in respect of the patent. For this reason, I have concluded that this is primarily a case in contract and that the patent issues are ancillary. Accordingly, this court is without jurisdiction
. The plaintiff should pursue his rights in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. As Mr. Justice Dube noted in
Laurin v. Champagne
(1991), 38 C.P.R.(3d) 193 at p. 196, 49 F.T.R. 280; 29 A.C.W.S.(3d) 538 (T.D.), the plaintiff may apply to this court in the future to vary the registration of the Assignment should such an application be required." (My emphasis)
