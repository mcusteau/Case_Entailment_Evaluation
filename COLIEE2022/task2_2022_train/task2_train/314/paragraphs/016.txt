Madam Justice Allen's findings may be helpful to determine the ownership of the Canadian patents; they may have a persuasive value, but they are not determinative or dispositive in respect of the ownership of the Canadian patents. I cannot find, on the basis of her reasoning, that the issue of whether Northstar is entitled to the Canadian patents has been judicially decided. The B.C. action merely dismissed his claim to the U.S. patents and did not deal with Canadian patents at all. While the parties are the same or their privies, and while the decision is final, the issue was not the same. Thus, there is no room for issue estoppel.
