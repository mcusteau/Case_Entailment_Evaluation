In
Benjamin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2006] F.C.J. No. 750; [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 366 (F.C.) Mr. Justice Konrad von Finckenstein (as he then was) stated, in obiter, on a judicial review of a H&C decision that he could see no benefit in removing the applicant to Nigeria, while his application sponsored by his wife was being considered, only to bring him back to Canada in an expedited fashion should the application be successful. Justice von Finckenstein held at paragraph 18:
"Such a procedure totally fails to take into account the pain, dislocation and emotional toil entailed in any removal. The Respondent should keep the aforementioned factors in mind before attempting a removal while the Applicant's 'spouse in Canada application' is pending."
