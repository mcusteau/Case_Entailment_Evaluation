I find that there is no indication that the officer decided the application based on whether the applicants "deserved" to stay in Canada, as the applicants allege. In considering the prolonged stay in Canada of an H&C applicant, it is acceptable for an immigration officer to consider whether all or part of that stay was by choice. It is also appropriate to find that applicants cannot benefit from time lapsed while they elected to pursue PRRA and H&C applications:
Gonzalez et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2009] F.T.R. Uned. 62; 2009 FC 81 at paragraph 29. It was open to the PRRA officer to note, correctly, that the applicants' home was purchased while they were subject to a removal order. The test of "unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship" was correctly stated in the decision and these findings do not establish that the PRRA officer erred or applied the wrong test.
Issue No. 4: Did the PRRA officer fail to adequately consider the best interests of the child?
