Mr. Justice Denis Pelletier (as he then was) in
Irimie v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.T.R. Uned. 597; [2000] F.C.J. No. 1906 (T.D.) held to trigger "hardship" there must be something other than that which is inherent in being asked to leave Canada after having been in Canada for a period of time. Leaving one's family and friends and employment and residence in Canada is not enough to justify hardship. The applicants must show "unusual hardship", more than what would be experienced by others who are being asked to leave Canada after their legal rights to remain in Canada have expired. Mr. Justice Pelletier held as follows:
"Â¶12 If one then turns to the comments about unusual or undeserved which appear in the Manual, one concludes that unusual and undeserved is in relation to others who are being asked to leave Canada. It would seem to follow that the hardship which would trigger the exercise of discretion on humanitarian and compassionate grounds should be something other than that which is inherent in being asked to leave after one has been in place for a period of time."
