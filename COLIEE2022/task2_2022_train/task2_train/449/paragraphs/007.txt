The applicant submits that the PRRA officer erred in the following five ways:
a. finding that there were no obstacles to the applicants returning as members of the family class;
b. conflating the PRRA test with the H&C test regarding risk and associated hardship;
c. finding that the applicants' establishment in Canada was merely normal and "expected";
d. characterizing the H&C test for hardship as simply "undeserved," misconstruing evidence and rendering an unreasonable decision with regard to the length of the applicants' stay in Canada and their establishment; and
e. failing to take into account the best interests of the minor applicant.
