With respect, the applicants misstate the standard. The relevant issue is not whether remaining in Canada is the best possible alternative for the minor applicant, but whether his best interests would be adversely affected by removal. In
Vasquez et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) et al.
(2005), 268 F.T.R. 122; 2005 FC 91, Mr. Justice Russell stated at paragraphs 41-44:
"
¶41
What the Applicants are really saying in this case is that the children would obviously be better off in Canada than in Mexico or Honduras and, because they would be better off, Canada's international Convention obligations dictate that factor be given paramountcy in an H&C Decision that involves both parents and children.
"
¶42
I do not think that law, logic or established authority dictates the result urged upon the Court by the Applicants.
"
¶43
On the facts of this case, there is nothing to suggest that the children would be at risk or could not successfully re-establish themselves in Mexico or Honduras. The fact that the children might be better off in Canada in terms of general comfort and future opportunities cannot, in my view, be conclusive in an H&C Decision that is intended to assess undue hardship.
"
¶44
I am of the view that the guidance of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 4 F.C. 358; 2002 FCA 125, at para. 12 remains applicable to this case:
'In short, the immigration officer must be "alert, alive and sensitive" (
Baker
, supra, at paragraph 75) to the interests of the children, but once she has well identified and defined this factor, it is up to her to determine what weight, in her view, it must be given in the circumstances. The presence of children ... does not call for a certain result.'"
