The applicants are currently the subject of an application by their daughter to sponsor them as members of the family class. This sponsorship application was filed over 1 year ago, and acknowledged by the respondent on April 24, 2008. The respondent advised the daughter that sponsorship applications for parents "are experiencing longer processing times", i.e. do not expect an answer soon. The PRRA officer stated in his decision (at p. 2c of the Application Record):
"It is understandable that the applicant[s] would want to remain in Canada with their extended family considering they have been together since they last travelled to Canada ... However, I note the purpose of H&C discretion is to allow flexibility to approve deserving cases not anticipated in the legislation. I have to look to the possibility of reunification through an existing program such as the family class program which exists for cases such as the one before me. I find there are no apparent obstacles that would impede an overseas sponsorship."
