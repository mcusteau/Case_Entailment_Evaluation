The respondents submit that the applicants' situation is "a mundane and relatively common scenario" and that remaining economically or academically productive in Canada does not render having to return to Guyana undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. I agree. I do not find that maintaining employment and integrating into the community over a period of six years constitutes an unusually high degree of establishment. There is nothing in the applicants circumstances which necessitates that the applicants be found to fit "into the special category of cases" where an H&C is warranted:
