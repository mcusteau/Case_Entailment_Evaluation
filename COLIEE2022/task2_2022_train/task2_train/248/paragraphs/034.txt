Turning to the merits of the decision, the applicant submits that the visa officer improperly exercised his discretion by adopting as his own the decision which was made in Ottawa concerning the applicant. The visa officer did not independently consider the information he received. In my view, this submission is groundless. While the visa officer did receive information from Ottawa and from the R.C.M.P., there is no indication that he did not weigh this evidence and arrive at his own conclusion. Mr. Delisle is an experienced visa officer and understands what is required of him.
