The principles to be applied in determining whether a statutory scheme violates the principles of fundamental justice were enunciated by Sopinka, J., in
Chiarelli v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711; 135 N.R. 161. In considering the constitutionality of legislation governing the deportation of permanent residents convicted of certain criminal offences, Sopinka, J., confirmed the importance of adopting a contextual approach to the interpretation of s. 7 of the
Charter
. In this regard, he stated as follows at p. 733:
"Thus in determining the scope of principles of fundamental justice as they apply to this case, the court must look to the principles and policies underlying immigration law. The most fundamental principle of immigration law is that noncitizens do not have an unqualified right to enter or remain in the country. At common law an alien has no right to enter or remain in the country.
. . . . .
"The distinction between citizens and noncitizens is recognized in the
Charter
. While permanent residents are given the right to move to, take up residence in, and pursue the gaining of a livelihood in any province in s. 6(2), only citizens are accorded the right 'to enter, remain in and leave Canada' in s. 6(1).
"Thus Parliament has the right to adopt an immigration policy and to enact legislation prescribing the conditions under which noncitizens will be permitted to enter and remain in Canada. It has done so in the
Immigration Act
."
In my opinion, these words of Sopinka, J., are directly applicable to the case at bar. An analysis of the scope of the principles of fundamental justice in proceedings under s. 82.1(10) of the
Immigration Act
must be conducted in the context of the principles and policies underlying immigration law, particularly the principle that an alien has no right to enter or remain in Canada.
