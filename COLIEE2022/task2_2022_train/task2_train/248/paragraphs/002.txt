The facts in this case are not in dispute. On August 16, 1990, the Commission for Canada in Hong Kong received an application for permanent residence in Canada from the applicant and her dependant son, Stanley Cheung Tak Kwai. The applicant stated she was unmarried and had a personal net worth of $1,485,273 CAD. On October 27, 1992, the application was favourably reviewed without the need for an interview by a visa officer, James Gill.
