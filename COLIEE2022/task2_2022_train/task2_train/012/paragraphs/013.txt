  In my view, the evidence here of concern, in particular the letter from the applicant's parents, whatever weight the board might assign to it, on its face has relevance to at least two of these principal reasons relied on by the board, the second and the third, the cumulative assessment of his fear of persecution and the issue of change in country circumstances. It would not be consistent, in my view, with the principles of fairness applicable to the operations of the CRDD that a decision should stand when it makes no reference to relevant evidence proffered in the letters submitted before the decision, leaving the applicant and this court uncertain whether or not that evidence was considered at all.
