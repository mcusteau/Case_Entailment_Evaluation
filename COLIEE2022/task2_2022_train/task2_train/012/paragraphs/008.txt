  Secondly, counsel for the applicant noted the decision does review in considerable detail the evidence of various incidents involving the applicant, which he claims gave rise to his fear of persecution. Yet, no reference is made to the letter from his parents, the latest evidence, relating to events since his departure from Bulgaria said to affect him. That is all the more surprising in my view, in light of the decision and its very brief reference to a change of circumstances within Bulgaria after the applicant left. In its decision the board stated: 
 
 
 
 "With the current political changes in Bulgaria the claimant need not fear persecution for defecting nor for making a refugee claim." 
 
 
 
 The decision includes a further statement drawn from a Canadian Embassy telex, of the Department of External Affairs, but it adds nothing to this particular case. It is a general statement of Bulgarian law in 1990 that refers to minimal fines for returning Bulgarians who overstay an authorized visit abroad.
