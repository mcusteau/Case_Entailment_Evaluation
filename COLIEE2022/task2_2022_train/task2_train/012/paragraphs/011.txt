  Thirdly, as I read the decision, the tribunal appears to accept the evidence put forward by the applicant, at least in relation to various incidents, apparently accepting, but without expressly so stating, that he had a subjective fear of persecution. It does not clearly state that it finds no objective basis for that fear or that the fear of the applicant is not well-founded. It is clear in its assessment of each of the several incidents reviewed, that the particular incident in itself was not considered to constitute persecution. Nor did the various incidents, viewed cumulatively, constitute persecution. This implies that the Board found no objective basis for the fear claimed by the applicant, but such a finding is not expressly made.
