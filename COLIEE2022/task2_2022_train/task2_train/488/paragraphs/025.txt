Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer decided likewise in
Ali v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
(1996), 112 F.T.R. 9 (T.D.), relying on Mr. Justice Rothstein's judgment in
Bogus v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 71 F.T.R. 260 (T.D.). Rothstein, J., had concluded, at paragraph 5:
"That he re-availed himself of the protection of Turkey on three occasions (counsel agreed that the facts are that he had only returned to Turkey twice) and that this reflects negatively on his alleged fears. The panel stated at p. 89:
'In addition, the panel must take note that you did re-avail yourself, and there's no - there appears to be no conflict in your testimony in this area - of the protection of Turkey on no less than three occasions.
You went back on three occasions. And this action itself must reflect negatively upon the voracity (sic) of your alleged fears, in our opinion, of returning now to Turkey.
'
"In my opinion, it was open to the panel to assess the evidence and conclude that the applicant did not have a credible basis for his claim by reason of his actions or inactions that were inconsistent with having a subjective and objective fear of persecution in Turkey. Such findings are clear and unambiguous. It is true they do not include express words such as 'we do not believe the applicant'. But the words that are used 'reflect negatively upon the voracity (sic) of your alleged fears' and '[t]hese are not the actions or inactions of a person in your circumstances', together with the reasons given, demonstrate beyond doubt, that the panel did not believe that the applicant had a subjective and objective fear of persecution in Turkey and therefore did not have a credible basis for his refugee claim."
