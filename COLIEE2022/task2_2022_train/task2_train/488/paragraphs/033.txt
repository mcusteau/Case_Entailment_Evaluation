The applicant argues that the Refugee Division erred in not considering the following things:
- the persecution of all the members of her family: her son, her aunt, her cousin and her three children, her brother and her mother, and the fact that they all obtained refugee status in Canada;
- the break-up of the applicant's family as a result of the political atmosphere in Uzbekistan and the responsibility of the Uzbeks in discriminating against and persecuting minorities;
- the suffering experienced by the applicant as a result of her son's exile in Russia since 1994, the two of them having always lived together until then;
- by refusing the applicant's claim and accepting her son's, the panel exposed the applicant to a new separation from her son;
- in thus deciding, the panel failed to consider and appreciate the fundamental principle, which is to promote the reunification of the members of a refugee family.
