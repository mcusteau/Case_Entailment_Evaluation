Without deciding which stressors outside the usual human existence evoke the requisite significant symptoms of distress to potentially ground a diagnosis of PTSD, the Board found that no such stressor existed in the circumstances of the applicant in the case at bar. While the applicant cites 19 instances of alleged harassment by superior officers within the Armed Forces, each are alleged to stem from his claim of being falsely accused of having committed drug offences. The Board was not satisfied that the social stigma and humiliation the applicant claims to have endured are outside the range of "usual" human existence, nor that they are of such severity to "evoke significant symptoms of distress in almost any previously normal person".
