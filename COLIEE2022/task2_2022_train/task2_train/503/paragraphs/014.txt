On questions of law, I held in
Youden v. Canada (Attorney General)
(2005), 284 F.T.R. 314; 144 A.C.W.S.(3d) 866 (F.C.), at paragraph 10 that the Court has equal or greater expertise than the Board, and less deference is owed to the Board on issues of statutory interpretation, jurisdiction, or articulation of legal standards. In my view, decisions of the Board turning on questions of law are reviewable on a correctness standard.
