The applicant was referred to Dr. Furman by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Dr. Furman confirmed the basis upon which the applicant applied for the pension. The applicant reasonably relied upon the psychologist chosen by the respondent, and cannot be faulted for pursuing his pension claim on that basis, including bringing this matter before the Federal Court. Accordingly, there will be no order of costs against the applicant.
