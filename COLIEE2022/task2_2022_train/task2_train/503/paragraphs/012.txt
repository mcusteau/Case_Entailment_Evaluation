[12]
In the Court's view, three main issues are raised on this application:
1. Did the Board err in rejecting the uncontradicted medical evidence that the applicant suffered from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder?;
2. Did the Board err in failing to provide the benefit of the doubt to the applicant as required by ss. 3 and 39 of the
VRAB Act
?; and
3. Did the Board err by failing to obtain independent medical advice under s. 38(1) of the
VRAB Act
before rejecting the only medical evidence before the Board?
