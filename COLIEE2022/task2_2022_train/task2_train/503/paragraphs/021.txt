The Medical Guidelines limit diagnosis of PTSD to "the existence of a stressor, outside the range of usual human existence, of such severity that it would evoke significant symptoms of distress in almost any previously normal person" in conjunction with other essential factors including recurrent intrusive recollections, nightmares, detachment from others with restricted emotional responses, insomnia, and survivor guilt, inter alia.
