Having reviewed the documentary evidence highlighted by the applicant, I am unable to conclude that it clearly contradicts the Board's finding of a lack of objective support for the claim. The evidence indicates that in the generally volatile and violent environment of Columbia, the paramilitaries may seize persons such as the applicant to serve their purposes. Moreover, they have long memories in pursuing their enemies, and they maintain sophisticated databases of persons and locations. But why they would have an interest in a young woman who left eight years ago is not at all clear, when she appears to have meant nothing more to them than as an object of sexual abuse and as a cook. That, in itself, is appalling but it does not mean that her claim of a fear of persecution if she were to return to Columbia is objectively well-founded.
