Ms. Gonzalez based her claim for refugee protection on a fear of persecution at the hands of members of a paramilitary group who abused her during a four-month period in 1997. The applicant and her two sons, aged ten and eight as of the date of the Board's decision, left Colombia for the United States in May 1997 as visitors. They remained in the United States for four years and three months during which they made no claim for asylum.
