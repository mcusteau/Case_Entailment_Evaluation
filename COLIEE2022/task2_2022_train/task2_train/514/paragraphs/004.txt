I accept the submission of counsel for the Minister that where interpretation is required, all concerned must be prepared to use short sentences, speak slowly, use alternate words or phrases where a word or phrase is not understood or easily interpreted, and generally act in good faith. There should be no quarrel by counsel with trivialities of expression and meaning in an effort to make whole cloth from a few threads. However, despite the able argument of counsel for the Minister, I have been persuaded by the equally able argument of counsel for Ms. Saravia that in the present case, the difficulties in interpretation were of a more substantial quality.
