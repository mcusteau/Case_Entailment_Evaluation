To illustrate, the second interpreter provided at the hearing struggled with interpreting the words "demeanour", "onus", "stitches", "sober", "audited", "seized", and "waiving". There were omissions of substance with respect to comments made about the war in Iraq and Ms. Saravia's alleged attack by members of an organized crime gang. (Those omissions and other difficulties were identified by counsel at the hearing so no issue of waiver arises). In a transcript which begins on page 10 with the arrival of a second interpreter and continues until page 48, difficulties with the interpreter being able to understand the speaker (often the presiding member's questions to Ms. Saravia), or to interpret what the speaker said, are found on pages 12-15, 20-22, 24, 26, 28, 31, 35-39, 41, 42, 44, 46 and 47.
