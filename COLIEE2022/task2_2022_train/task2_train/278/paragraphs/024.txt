Essentially, the only question is whether evidence of a single sale will suffice. I am of the opinion that evidence of a single sale is sufficient to establish the use of a trademark in the normal course of trade depending upon the circumstances surrounding the transaction, provided the evidence was not manufactured for the sole and deliberate purpose of protecting the trademark registration: see Keepsake, Inc. v. Prestons Ltd., (1968), 69 C.P.R.(2d) 50, per Cattanach, J., at p. 55; John Labatt Ltd. v. Rainier Brewing Co. (1984), 80 C.P.R.(2d) 228 (F.C.A.) and American Distilling v. Canadian Schenley Distilleries (1977), 38 C.P.R.(2d) 60, per Thurlow, A.C.J., at pp. 62-63. Consequently, I reject the appellant's argument on the point of volume of sales.
