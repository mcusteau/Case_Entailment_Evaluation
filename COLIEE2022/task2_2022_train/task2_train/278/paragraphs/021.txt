In the Plough case, the Federal Court of Appeal expunged the trademark on the ground that the affidavit evidence failed to meet the requirement of s. 44(1) of "showing" the use of the trademark within the meaning of ss. 2 and 4 of the Act. The evidence found to be defective consisted of nothing more than the bare statement that the registrant was currently using the trademark in the normal course of trade in Canada in association with the pharmaceutical wares. This fact alone distinguishes that authority from the case at bar.
