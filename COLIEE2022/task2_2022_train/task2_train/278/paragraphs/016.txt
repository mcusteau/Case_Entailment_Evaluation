Stone, J., stated this opinion in John Labatt Ltd. v. Rainier Brewing Co., supra, at p. 233:
"... In my opinion, s. 44(1) does not, in terms, require that evidence of use be limited to use made on or immediately prior to the notice date. It only requires that, within the specified time-limit, the registered owner furnish an affidavit or statutory declaration 'showing with respect to each of the wares or services specified in the registration, whether the trademark is in use in Canada'."
