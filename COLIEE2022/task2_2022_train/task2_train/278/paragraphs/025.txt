The final issue is whether the Registrar of Trademarks was right or wrong in reaching the decision he did upon the evidence before him. The appeal is under s. 56 of the Trade Marks Act and there is no question that additional evidence may be adduced by affidavit beyond that adduced before the Registrar. Two additional affidavits were adduced in this case. Counsel for the appellant argues accordingly that this constitutes the appeal a trial de novo and enables me to overrule the Registrar of Trademarks by substituting my opinion for his, without regard to the weight to be attached to his decision. At least that is how I understand the argument. I must disagree. An appeal is not a trial de novo in the strict sense of that term. While the court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar, it should be circumspect about interfering with his decision unless it is reasonably apparent that the Registrar had gone wrong. I am satisfied that the evidence supports the Registrar's conclusion and that the decision was not based upon a wrong principle.
