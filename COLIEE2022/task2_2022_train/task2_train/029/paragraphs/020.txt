  The applicant is no doubt correct in stating that a state's ability to protect its citizens must be assessed not only by looking at the legislative and procedural framework in place, but also the capacity and the will to effectively implement that framework: see, for ex.  
 Elcock 
  v.  
 Canada (MCI) 
  (1999), 175 F.T.R. 116, 91 A.C.W.S. (3d) 820;  
 Mitchell 
  v.  
 Canada (MCI) 
 , 2006 FC 133, 51 Imm. L.R. (3d) 159;  
 Franklyn 
  v.  
 Canada (MCI) 
 , 2005 FC 1249, 142 A.C.W.S. (3d) 308. That being said, the test must not be set so high that it would virtually be impossible to meet even in the most developed democracies like Canada. As Justice Gibson said in  
 Smirnov 
  v.  
 Canada (Secretary of State) 
 , [1995] 1 F.C. 780 (T.D.), at par. 11, 52 A.C.W.S. (3d) 398: 
 
 
 
 With great respect, I conclude that Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer sets too high a standard for state protection, a standard that would, in many circumstances, be difficult to attain even in this country. It is a reality of modern-day life that protection offered is sometimes ineffective. Many incidents of harassment and/or discrimination can be effected in a manner that renders effective investigation and protection very difficult. The use of unsigned correspondence that does not identify its source and of random telephone communications where the caller does not identify himself or herself are examples. A single incident of defacement of property is another. The applicants suffered from these types of incidents and received no satisfaction when they reported them to the militia or police. Random assaults, such as those suffered by the applicants, where the assailants are unknown to the victim and there are no independent witnesses are also difficult to effectively investigate and protect against. In all such circumstances, even the most effective, well-resourced and highly motivated police forces will have difficulty providing effective protection. This Court should not impose on other states a standard of "effective" protection that police forces in our own country, regrettably, sometimes only aspire to.
