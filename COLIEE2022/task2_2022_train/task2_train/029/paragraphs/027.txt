  As this Court has said time and again, the police cannot be expected to offer effective protection, especially in a case of domestic violence, when the applicant herself is not prepared to cooperate. Some crimes are obviously more difficult to prosecute successfully, and absent a clear and systemic failure, incapacity or refusal of the authorities to investigate and press charges, we should hesitate before finding that the state is incapable of protecting its citizens.
