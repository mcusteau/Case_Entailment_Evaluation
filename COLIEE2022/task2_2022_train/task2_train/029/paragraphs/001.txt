 de Montigny, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (the tribunal), rendered on June 20, 2007, which concluded that the applicant was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. The tribunal member found the applicant to be credible but concluded that she did not rebut the presumption of state protection. Despite counsel for the applicant's able arguments, I have come to the conclusion that this application must be dismissed for the following reasons.
