  In June 2005, the applicant's husband learned that the applicant had asked her parents for money in order to send their children to school, and he beat her again. The applicant claims that she was beaten almost every day. By August 2005, her husband had begun to spend most of his time with the other woman and usually came back home only two or three times a week.
