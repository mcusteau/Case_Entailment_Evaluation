Eastman called upon his supervisor, a woman, to continue the examination of the plaintiff. The supervisor questioned whether any of the jewelry had been redesigned in India which the plaintiff then, for the first time, confirmed. Eastman also spoke with officer West about the manner of her earlier questioning of the plaintiff and was told of West's questioning in English and Punjabi and the plaintiff's professed desire to discuss matters in English. Eastman did this, he said, to assure himself that there was no reasonable doubt of the plaintiff's understanding of the questions that had been put to her. Having reached that conclusion he advised the plaintiff that in his view the
Customs Act
had not been complied with by the plaintiff and for this reason her jewelry was seized under the
Act
.
