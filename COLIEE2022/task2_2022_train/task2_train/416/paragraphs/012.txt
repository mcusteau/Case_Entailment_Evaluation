Not surprisingly, the plaintiff's evidence of events at Vancouver Airport on the plaintiff's arrival on February 8, 1988, differs in some respects from that of the customs officers called on behalf of the defendant. Where there is significant difference I rely on the evidence of the customs officers who were, in my view, more credible witnesses, clear in their testimony and their recollection of the events that transpired.
