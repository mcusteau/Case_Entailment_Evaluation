The plaintiff's evidence about arrangements to have her jewelry redesigned while in India was not helpful. She testified that her grandmother had made arrangements for this to be done, had taken 2000 rupees from her and her jewelry and had arranged, without the plaintiff being present, for the jewelry to be redesigned. The plaintiff, with other family members, did visit the jeweller to pick up the jewelry and at that time she was given a form by the jeweller, described as a form relating to gold added to her jewelry in its redesign. This, in my view, is not evident from the form itself which describes her and which she signed as "seller" of gold. The jeweller in India did not advise whether gold was added to her jewelry in its redesign and she professed no knowledge of whether any gold was added. She claims not to have understood the form which was printed and completed in English, but she signed it as directed by the jeweller who said they should present it to Customs officers upon her return to Canada if there were any questions about her jewelry. At trial she could not remember when she provided the original of that form to Canada Customs, though she probably did not do so on arrival in Canada but at some later date.
