There was no evidence clearly describing the items of jewelry before any of it was redesigned, other than the Vancouver jeweller's appraisal which related to more items than were here seized. The photocopies of photographs were not clear enough to depict the jewelry in any detail. There was no evidence from the plaintiff about what items were redesigned and no description of the items as changed by redesign. In argument the plaintiff's husband, her representative, suggested that redesign was minor at least in relation to certain pieces of the jewelry, i.e. that a long single strand necklace had simply been changed to a shorter necklace of three strands, and that of four bangle bracelets seized only two had been redesigned to match the other two which were left unchanged. Yet there was no evidence from witnesses or documents on which one could determine what was done in the redesign of jewelry in India, or if gold was added in redesign, and the person who ought to have known, the plaintiff, professed not to know.
