The plaintiff claims the goods seized, her personal jewelry, were owned by her prior to leaving Canada, as appears from photographs and an appraisal made of the jewelry before she left Canada and took the jewelry with her. While she admits that her jewelry was taken to be redesigned while she was in India, she claims that essentially they are the same pieces she owned, had photographed and appraised before leaving Canada and which she took with her when she departed Canada. By implication it is said the jewelry items were not imported into Canada in February 1988 so that there was no contravention of s. 12 of the
Act
and the seizure and the Minister's decision cannot be justified.
