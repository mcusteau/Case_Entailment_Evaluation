When the jewelry was seized, the plaintiff was apparently given a seizure receipt dated February 8, 1988 and apparently was later provided with a Statement of Goods Seized (Form K-99) which included evaluations based on appraisal of the goods seized. In her statement of claim the plaintiff alleged that she was not informed of the basis of the evaluation or appraisal, but no evidence was adduced at trial to question the evaluation by Canada Customs.
