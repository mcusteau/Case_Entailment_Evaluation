Under s. 11 of the
Customs Act
every person arriving in Canada is required to present himself or herself to a customs officer and answer truthfully any questions asked by the officer in the performance of his duties. Under s. 12 all goods that are imported are to be reported to a customs officer by a person who has possession of the goods or in whose baggage the goods are carried upon arrival in Canada. The person reporting goods has an obligation to answer truthfully any questions asked by a customs officer about the goods under s. 13, and s. 17 provides that imported goods are subject to duty from the time they are imported. While certain exemptions from duties are provided, for example, in relation to goods taken out of the country and brought back in by a resident of Canada, the onus of proving the exemption from duties lies on the person claiming exemption:
Freesman v. Canada
, [1982] 2 F.C. 900; 4 C.E.R. 117. Here that onus was not discharged by the plaintiff who, while admitting jewelry had been redesigned, professed not to know what changes had been wrought and no other evidence was adduced that clearly established that all or any of the items of jewelry seized by Customs officer Eastman were the same as those of the plaintiff appraised in Vancouver before she left for India.
