The important words are "a visa officer shall assess that immigrant or, at the option of the immigrant, the spouse of that immigrant". In my view the use of the words "or" and "at the option of the immigrant" indicate that it is the responsibility of the applicant to designate who will be assessed. The visa officer is not required to assess both the applicant and his spouse as submitted by the applicant. Rather s. 8(1) makes it mandatory for the visa officer to assess only one or the other. There is no provision in the
Immigration Act
or
Regulations
or any principle of procedural fairness which imposes a duty on the visa officer to apprise the immigrant of this option.
