The applicant applied for permanent residence in Canada as an Assisted Relative by filing his application form (Immigration Application) in Kenya. The visa officer testified that the applicant indicated that he (the applicant) wished to be considered as the principal applicant. He signed the Immigration Application. His wife accompanied him to the interview and Mrs. Nanji was asked some questions about her intended occupation as secretary which she had disclosed in the Supplementary Information Sheet supplied with the Immigration Application. The supplementary sheet states that it is "to be completed by the spouse and children under 18 of the principal applicant". The supplementary sheet has no place for a signature and was not signed by the wife of the applicant. In my view the facts disclose that Mr. Nanji was the only applicant and there is no implied application by the applicant's wife.
