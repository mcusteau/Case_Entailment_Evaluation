  In addition, the Commission states clearly that all factions of the conflict specifically targeted civilians, and that combatant groups executed brutal campaigns of terror against civilians in order to enforce their military and political agendas: TRC Report, at paras. 76 and 84. The Commission further found that while the majority of victims were adult males, the perpetrators also singled out women and children for some of the most brutal violations of human rights recorded: TRC Report, at paras. 77, 81-82. The Commission further stated that forced displacements, abductions, arbitrary detentions and killings were the most common violations. Other violations included destruction of property, assault/beating, looting of goods, physical torture, forced labour, extortion, rape, sexual abuse, amputation, forced recruitment, sexual slavery, drugging, and forced cannibalism: TRC Report, at paras. 78 and 87. Clearly many of these violations fall into the category of crimes against humanity, particularly in light of the fact that civilians were specifically targeted in systematic campaigns.
