  With respect to the leadership position of the applicant in particular, even where an organization's purpose has not been determined to be limited and brutal, it is "possible to infer knowledge of crimes and a common purpose with the perpetrators of the crimes when the person in question occupies a sufficiently high leadership position and either tolerates the crimes or fails to withdraw from the organization":  
 Cardenas 
 , above at para. 13. As was similarly noted by the Court of Appeal in  
 Sivakumar 
  at paragraph 10: "[b]earing in mind that each case must be decided on its facts, the closer one is to being a leader rather than an ordinary member, the more likely it is that an inference will be drawn that one knew of the crime and shared the organization's purpose in committing that crime. Thus, remaining in an organization in a leadership position with knowledge that the organization was responsible for crimes against humanity may constitute complicity." See also:
