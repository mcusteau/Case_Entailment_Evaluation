  Though the Amnesty International Report entitled "Sierra Leone: A disastrous set-back for human rights" which was before the Board, indicated that while the leader of AFRC, Major Johnny Paul Koroma, "has called on soldiers to refrain from illegal activity, lack of effective control over both soldiers and members of RUF has resulted in human rights violations being committed with impunity", the TRC Report repeatedly found that the leadership of the AFRC was responsible for the listed human rights violations. For example, the Commission found that " 
 the leadership and membership 
  of the AFRC displayed a particularly ruthless disregard for human life and limb", and that Johnny Paul Koroma " 
 was the man most responsible for the violations and abuses carried out by the AFRC soldiers 
 : first as the Head of State under the AFRC junta government; later in his capacity as the Chairman of the ill-fated Commission for the Consolidation of Peace": (Emphasis mine) TRC Report, at paras. 232 and 239.
