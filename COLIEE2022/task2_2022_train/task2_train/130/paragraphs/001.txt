 Mosley, J. 
 : The applicant, a citizen of Sierre Leone, seeks judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated June 14, 2006, in which the Board determined that Mr. Thomas was not a refugee or a person in need of protection due to his exclusion pursuant to section 98 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27. While the Board's decision is not error free, for the reasons that follow I am satisfied that no reasonably instructed tribunal could have reached a different conclusion and exercise my discretion to dismiss the application.
