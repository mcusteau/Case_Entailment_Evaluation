  The respondent, the applicant and the Board all refer to the same case law and principles in setting out what the appropriate law to apply is in the present case. For example, the Board citing  
 Gutierrez et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1994] F.C.J. No. 1494; 84 F.T.R. 227 (T.D.), at para. 22 (T.D.) ( 
 Gutierrez 
 ) referred to the fact that there are three prerequisites to making a finding of complicity, including: 
 
 
 
 "1) membership  
 in an organization which committed international offences 
  as a continuous and regular part of its operation; 
 
 
 
 "2)  
 personal and knowing participation 
 ; and 
 
 
 
 "3)  
 failure to dissociate 
  from the organization at the earliest safe opportunity." (Emphasis mine) 
 
 
 
 These prerequisites were established by the Court in  
 Gutierrez 
  on the basis of an excerpt taken from the earlier decision of  
 Penate v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1993] F.C.J. No. 1292; 71 F.T.R. 171 (T.D.), at paras. 4-6 (T.D.) wherein the Court had summarized the principles set out in the foundational cases of:  
 Ramirez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1992] 2 F.C. 306; 135 N.R. 390 (F.C.A.) ( 
 Ramirez 
 );  
 Moreno and Sanchez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1994] 1 F.C. 298; 159 N.R. 210 (F.C.A.); and  
 Sivakumar 
 . These three prerequisites have since been utilized by the Court, indicating they represent an accurate summary of the law, see for example:  
 Petrov v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2007] F.T.R. Uned. 953; 2007 FC 465, at para. 8;  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Yaqoob 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 595; 2005 FC 1017, at para. 26.
