The first condition in Rule 210 has been met. In the case at bar, the evidence in the record indicated that three copies of the plaintiff's statement of claim and amended statement of claim were served personally on the defendant Mitchell Levine, for himself, and as director and officer of MRL Horticultural Services and Bio-Lawncare Services Ltd. Following service of these pleadings, the defendants failed to file a defence within the deadline specified in Rule 204. Consequently, the defendants were in default in filing their defence to the action. Further, the affidavit evidence filed in support of the motion indicated that in the case at bar there had been an ongoing and deliberate infringement of the plaintiff's right in the trademark BIO-LAWN.
