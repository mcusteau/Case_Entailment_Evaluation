According to the evidence in the record in the case at bar, the use of the mark BIO-LAWN and logo by the defendants without the plaintiff's consent is such as to cause confusion with the plaintiff's registered mark according to the tests laid down in subsections 6(2) and (5) of the
Act
, and as the latter have been applied by the courts (
Miss Universe Inc. v. Bohna
, [1995] 1 F.C. 614; 176 N.R. 35; 58 C.P.R.(3d) 381 (F.C.A.), at 387 [C.P.R.]). The use of a trademark creates confusion with another trademark when the use of both marks is likely to lead to the conclusion that the wares associated with the trademarks are made or sold by the same person. That is the case here in Ontario, and in particular in the Toronto area.
