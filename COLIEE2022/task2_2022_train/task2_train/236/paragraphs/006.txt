We should also mention that the plaintiff's products are sold in Canada in different markets. In particular, since 1993, the plaintiff has sold its products in Ontario under the trademark BIO-LAWN, inter alia in the municipalities of Bolton, Timmins, Burgessville, London, St. Catharines, Cumberland, Richmond Hill and greater Toronto.
