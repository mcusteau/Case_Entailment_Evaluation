Unlike certain procedural systems, allegations which are not admitted in this Court are deemed to be denied (Rule 184). A judgment by default cannot be obtained simply [Translation] "in view of the pleadings". If the allegations set out in a statement of claim are not admitted, they remain allegations, and there is no proof of their veracity or accuracy if no affidavit is filed (

, [2001] F.T.R. Uned. 768; [2001] F.C.J. No. 1626; 2001 FCT 895). Under Rule 210, there are two stages: (1) first, the plaintiff must establish that the defendant is "in default" (which is the case if he has not filed his defence within the deadline specified in Rule 204 or any other deadline set by order of the Court); and (2) second, it is necessary to determine whether the evidence in support of the motion makes it possible to grant the judgment sought (if not, the action may be dismissed or certain conclusions may be rejected by the Court).
