  As the Supreme Court stated at paragraph 47 of  
 Dunsmuir 
 , reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. It is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. Thus the fact that the Court may have reached a different conclusion on the evidence does not justify interference with the Tribunal's decision if it meets the reasonableness standard.
