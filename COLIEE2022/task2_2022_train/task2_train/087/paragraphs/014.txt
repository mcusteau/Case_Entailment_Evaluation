  Justice Gauthier, then a member of this Court, addressed the standard of review in  
 Singer v Canada (Attorney General) 
 , 2010 FC 607, aff'd 2011 FCA 178, [ 
 Singer 
 ], a pension case raising similar questions to those in this matter. She found, at paragraph 18, that the appropriate standard to apply to the sufficiency of the reasons and the application of the legal test to the facts of the case was reasonableness. I agree with that conclusion.
