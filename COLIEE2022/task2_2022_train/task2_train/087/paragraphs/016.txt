  The applicant submits that the Tribunal failed to consider all of the evidence. She points to stamps in her U.S. passport showing her exiting Canada on July 4, 1977 (and re-entering on July 15, 1977) as demonstrating that by that date she was already resident in Montr√©al, and was heading south for a vacation with her mother in New York. She states that at that time only trips longer than a week were marked by a stamp at the border. This indicates, she submits, that she was not leaving Canada for prolonged periods to live in the U.S. in 1977. She argues that the Tribunal recorded that it had observed those stamps but did not analyze their significance, and therefore it failed to have regard to the evidence.
