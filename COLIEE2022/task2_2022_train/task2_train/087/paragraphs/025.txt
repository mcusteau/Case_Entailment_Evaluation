  In the present case, the Tribunal reviewed several factors: the absence of proof of a lease or home ownership in Canada, the failure to authorize the retrieval of government records, the absence of banking records, the ties to the applicant's mother in the U.S. and the corresponding lack of proof of ties to anyone in Montréal before 1978, the absence of proof of the whereabouts of the applicant's furniture prior to spring 1978, the absence of proof of having severed ties with the employer in the U.S., the frequency and length of absences from Canada to visit the U.S., and the absence of proof of lifestyle or establishment in Montréal.
