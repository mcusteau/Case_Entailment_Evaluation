Section 14(6) of the
Act
is intended to preclude any appeal from the decision of the Federal Court - Trial Division. As a result, the Court of Appeal has not been called upon to resolve this conflicting case law. judges of the Trial Division have not been fettered in expressing their own view. In my opinion, it is open to the citizenship judge to adopt either one of the conflicting schools in this court and, if the facts of the case were properly applied to the principles of the chosen approach, the decision of the citizen足ship judge would not be wrong. Until now, Federal Court trial judges, presiding over the de novo hearings, have generally felt free to substitute their view of the residency re足quirement for the one expressed in the de足cision under appeal. The divergence of views, both in this court and among citizen足ship judges, has brought uncertainty to the administration of justice in these matters.
