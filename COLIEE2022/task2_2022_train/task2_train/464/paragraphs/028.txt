It is useful to consider briefly the few procedures set out for citizenship ap­plications. According to s. 12 of the
Citizen­ship Regulations, 1993
, [see footnote 37] there is no requirement for the recording of testimony received by the citizenship judge, even where it is given under oath. The absence of a transcript was not a serious issue in a de novo appeal before this court. In a statutory appeal by way of application, however, the absence of the record can only be compensated by fulsome affidavits con­cerning the information the applicant for citizenship provided to the citizenship judge. [see footnote 38] Currently, the record is usually limited to the applicant's extensive documentary evidence and the reasons for decision of the citizenship judge. These reasons are often quite brief.
