Under the former
Federal Court Rules
, an appeal pursuant to s. 14(5) proceeded by way of trial de novo. [see footnote 4] This is no longer the case. According to rule 300(c) of the
Federal Court Rules, 1998
, a citizen­ship appeal is now dealt with as an ap­plication. However, the statutory appeal from the decision of a citizenship judge is not an application for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
. [see footnote 5]
