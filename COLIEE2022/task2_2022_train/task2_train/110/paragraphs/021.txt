  The IAD reviewed many factors relating to Mr. Baro's circumstances and those of his family members. However, Mr. Baro submits that the IAD failed to take adequate account of the effect on Mr. Baro's parents if he were to be sent back to the Philippines (where his parents reside) and could no longer remit to them a portion of his Canadian earnings. Any salary he earned in the Philippines would be lower than his Canadian wages.
