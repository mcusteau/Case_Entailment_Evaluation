  Mr. Baro says that the IAD made a clear error when it concluded that his testimony was not credible. Before the IAD, Mr. Baro had claimed that he took the certificate in a sealed envelope to the Canadian Embassy and only found out what the certificate said much later. Accordingly, Mr. Baro submits that the IAD erred when it found that he had submitted the certificate knowing it to be inaccurate. Although he had testified before the Board that he was surprised that it did not mention his first marriage, he had never said that he was aware of its contents before he submitted it.
