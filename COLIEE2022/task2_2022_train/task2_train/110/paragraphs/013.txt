  However, as mentioned, the Board also found that Mr. Baro had failed to disclose material information when he omitted to mention his marital history. This conclusion is unaffected by the Board's erroneous finding that Mr. Baro had knowingly misled Canadian authorities. On this point, Mr. Baro argues that his conduct should not result in a finding of inadmissibility since he was never specifically asked about his marital history. Accordingly, he was under no duty to inform Canadian authorities of his previous marriage or the circumstances surrounding its dissolution. Further, Mr. Baro submits that his previous marriage was not relevant to his application for permanent residence and his failure to disclose it could not have induced an error in the administration of the Act because his second marriage was clearly valid.
