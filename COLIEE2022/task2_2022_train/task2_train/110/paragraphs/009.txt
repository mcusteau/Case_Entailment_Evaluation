  Mr. Baro appealed to the IAD, which upheld the Board's decision. The IAD found that Mr. Baro knew that the certificate, which contained no reference to his first marriage, was inaccurate. It concluded that Mr. Baro had been asked to confirm his marital status and, by supplying a document he knew to be incorrect, he misrepresented a relevant fact. The IAD referred to Mr. Baro's testimony before the Board and rejected the contention that Mr. Baro was unaware of the contents of the certificate until after he arrived in Canada. Accordingly, unlike the Board, the IAD made a negative credibility finding against Mr. Baro on the basis that his evidence was inconsistent on this point. Further, the IAD found that Mr. Baro, by omitting to mention his first marriage and the order of presumptive death, had failed to disclose material facts.
