  In 1999, Mr. Baro applied for permanent residence in Canada, sponsored by Ms. Tuzon. Canadian authorities in Manila asked him for a "marriage check". In particular, they asked him to provide a certificate from the National Statistics Office in the Philippines, which maintains a registry of marriages. Mr. Baro obtained the certificate but it contained no reference to his prior marriage to Ms. Gandeza. Mr. Baro did not tell Canadian officials that he was previously married or that he had obtain an order of presumptive death in relation to his first wife.
