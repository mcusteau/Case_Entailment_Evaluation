In my opinion, given the early establishment of the residences and businesses in British Columbia, there is ample evidence on the record for me to conclude that residency in Canada had been established well before the citizenship applications were filed. In addition, even having regard to the fact that the Applicants are well short of the 1095 days of residence required by the
Act
, on the flexible approach adopted by application of
Re Papadogiorgakis
and
Re Koo
, there is ample evidence for me to conclude that, throughout the four-year period immediately preceding their citizenship applications, the Applicants possessed a sincere intention to, and made active efforts to, maintain their residence in Canada.
