In the present case, the Citizenship Judge attempted to apply the decision in
Re Koo
, and, as a result, the Applicant argues that it was incumbent on him to address each of the factors suggested in the decision, which, it is argued, he failed to do. In support of this argument, the Applicant cites
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Mueller
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 113; [2005] F.C.J. No. 266 (F.C.), in which Justice Snider granted a citizenship appeal on the ground that there were shortcomings in the citizenship judge's analysis of the
Koo
factors. The Respondent argues that the
Koo
factors need not be specifically addressed, but it is enough if it can be discerned from the Citizenship Judge's decision that the factors were in his or her mind when the decision was rendered.
