The plaintiffs submit that since the defendants invoke Hong Kong and New York jurisdiction in the alternative, there clearly is no more suitable forum than Canada. However, I place little value on the New York jurisdiction clause set out in the freight invoice. It was issued after the Bill of Lading and covers Kuehne & Nagel Inc.'s activities as an agent for the cargo interests. It is being sued, rightly or wrongly, as a carrier. Furthermore, that jurisdiction clause would not benefit the other Moving Parties.
