In the
ECU-Line
case referred to above, Mr. Justice Bastarache in another obiter statement was also of the view that s. 46(1) had the effect of removing from the Federal Court its power under s. 50 of the
Federal Courts
Act
to stay proceedings in light of a forum selection clause if the requirements of s. 46(1) were met. He stated at paragraph 38:
"Indeed, s. 46(1) would appear to establish that, in select circumstances, Parliament has deemed it appropriate to limit the scope of foreign selection clauses by facilitating the litigation in Canada of claims related to the carriage of goods by Canada having a minimum level of connection to this country."
