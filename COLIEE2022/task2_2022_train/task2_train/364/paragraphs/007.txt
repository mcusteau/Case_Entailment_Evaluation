The terms and conditions of a bill of lading are not necessarily the terms and conditions of the contract of affreightment as the bill is issued after that contract was made. However absent evidence to the contrary, there is a presumption that the bill evidences the terms and conditions of the contract. The only other possibility in this case would be the terms and conditions of a subsequent freight invoice on which more will be said. In my opinion, the bill of lading trumps.
