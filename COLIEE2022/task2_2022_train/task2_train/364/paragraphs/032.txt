However by the time the Federal Court of Appeal came to grips with a shipment subsequent to the enactment of s. 46, these obiter remarks were not followed. In
Magic Sportswear Corp. et al. v. OT Africa Line Ltd. et al.
, [2007] 2 F.C.R. 733; 352 N.R. 331; 2006 FCA 284, the Court was dealing with a claim for damage to cargo carried from New York to Liberia under a Bill of Lading calling for English jurisdiction, the jurisdiction where the defendant had its principal place of business. The Canadian connection was that the contract was made here, where the carrier had a branch office. The Court was also faced with the fact that the carrier had commenced proceedings in the High Court in London claiming damages for breach of the jurisdiction clause and had obtained an anti-suit injunction.
