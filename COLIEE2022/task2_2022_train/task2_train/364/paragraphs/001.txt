Harrington, J.
: The issue before the Court is whether an admiralty action instituted in Canada in personam by two foreign corporations against four foreign corporations for loss overboard of cargo shipped from one foreign port and intended for discharge and delivery in another foreign jurisdiction should be stayed in favour of still another jurisdiction, the jurisdiction stipulated in the Bill of Lading. In my opinion, the Defendants have not made out that there is a more convenient forum and so I dismiss their motion with costs.
