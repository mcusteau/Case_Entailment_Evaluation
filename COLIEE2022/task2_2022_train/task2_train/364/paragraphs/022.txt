The international regime covering carriage of cargo under bills of lading to which Canada adheres is the
Hague Rules
with the
Visby Protocol
. These rules are set out in Schedule 3 of the
Marine Liability
Act
. They do not compulsorily apply to import shipments. The
Hamburg Rules
have also been enacted in Canada and are to be found in Schedule 4 of the
Act
. However they have not been proclaimed in force. The
Hague-Visby Rules
have no jurisdictional provisions. The
Hamburg Rules
do, as set forth in article 21 thereof. However since no evidence has been led that they are applicable in the other jurisdictions to which this case has some contact, Taiwan, Hong Kong and the United States, I will not consider whether Canada would maintain jurisdiction over the defendants if they were applicable.
