As noted by Lord Macmillan in
Stag Line Ltd. v. Foscolo, Mango & Co.
, [1932] A.C. 328 (H.L.) at page 350:
"It is important to remember that the
Act
of 1924 was the outcome of an International Conference and that the rules in the Schedule have an international currency. As these rules must come under the consideration of foreign Courts it is desirable in the interests of uniformity that their interpretation should not be rigidly controlled by domestic precedents of antecedent date, but rather that the language of the rules should be construed on broad principles of general acceptation."
