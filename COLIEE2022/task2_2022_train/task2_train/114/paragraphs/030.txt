  In the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Reference Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486; 63 N.R. 266, Lamer, J., dealt with the significance of the principles of fundamental justice and said (at page 501) that these principles are "not a protected interest, but rather a qualifier of the right not to be deprived of life, liberty and security of the person". Further down he held that "as a qualifier, the phrase serves to establish the parameters of the interests". He also expressed the view that "it would be wrong to interpret the term fundamental justice as being synonymous with natural justice". He found (at page 503) that the principles "are to be found in the basic tenets of our legal system".
