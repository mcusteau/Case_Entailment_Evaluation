  Relying on R. v. Neale (1985), 46 C.R.(3d) 366, he suggests that the word "deprivation" in s. 7 "is limited to the complete loss or absolute denial of the right to life, liberty and security of the person, but includes its mere infringement". He quotes Bolling v. Sharpe (1954), 347 U.S. 497; 98 L. Ed. 884; 74 S. Ct. 693, for the proposition that "liberty under law extends to the full range of conduct which the individual is free to pursue".
