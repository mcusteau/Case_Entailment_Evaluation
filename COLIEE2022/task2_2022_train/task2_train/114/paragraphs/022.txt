  According to the petitioner, those words set no limit upon the Board as to the power it may choose to exert: those words purport to posit upon the Board the power to deny totally any or all of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter, thus placing the Board beyond the purview of s. 1 of the Charter and placing a parolee outside the shelter. The petitioner submits that, by this fact alone, s. 10(1)(a) is rendered inoperative, to the extent of that inconsistency, by s. 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.
