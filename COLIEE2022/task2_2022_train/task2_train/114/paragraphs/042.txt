 [42] 
  In three American cases the issue was the validity of parole conditions prohibiting the parolee from associating with certain classes of people. In Birzon v. Edward S. King (1972), 469 F. 2d 1241, the condition was that the parolee would not associate with persons engaged in criminal activity. That condition was held not to be unconstitutionally vague. The United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, said (at page 1243): 
 
 
 
 "... Although a parolee should enjoy greater freedom in many respects than a prisoner, we see no reason why the Government may not impose restrictions on the rights of the parolee that are reasonably and necessarily related to the interests that the Government retains after his conditional release. The restriction here involved is reasonably and necessarily related to the Government's legitimate interests in the parolee's activities and thus does not violate the first amendment."
