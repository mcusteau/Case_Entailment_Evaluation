 [33] 
  Under the circumstances of the instant case, I cannot find that the Board was patently unreasonable in prohibiting the petitioner from meeting with people with a criminal record. In Re Conroy and The Queen, 42 O.R.(2d) 342, the court held that if the Board can impose any reasonable condition it deems desirable at the outset of the parole, it may do so again "when a change in circumstances [so] dictates". The Board, in my view, had full authority to decide as it did under the Act and the condition imposed is not obviously so unreasonable as to constitute an excess of jurisdiction.
