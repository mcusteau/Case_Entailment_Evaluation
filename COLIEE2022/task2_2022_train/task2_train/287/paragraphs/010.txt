Rule 465(3) dealing with examinations for discovery provides that after the defence has been filed (and after the documents have been exchanged) the plaintiff may examine the defendant (if he has not already examined the latter before filing the defence). It logically follows that the defence must be a pleading in accordance with the Rules before the plaintiff goes ahead with the examination, and so a pleading which provides the aforementioned particulars. If it is not in accordance with the Rules, the plaintiff may require the necessary particulars before proceeding with its examination. Moreover, the court cannot assume that such an examination will take place, even if this is likely [see footnote 2].
