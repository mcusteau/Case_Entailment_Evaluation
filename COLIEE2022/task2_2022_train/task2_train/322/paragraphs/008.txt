At some time in 1970, Bill testified it was summer, and John said early autumn, the projected business, on a loosely informal partnership basis, was tested, in Penticton, British Columbia. Two items of construction equipment were acquired by William in Northland's name, of which one was shortly there-after rented out - on an all-found basis. That autumn the brothers discussed and planned the formation of a corporation for the equipment rental business in Penticton. John would resign from the ministry of highways and take charge of the operation. William would provide seed money in the amount of $20,000.00 and Northland would provide financing to acquire new or additional equipment up to the extent of $125,000.00. The equipment was to be kept in Northland's ownership until paid off and then it would be bought by the new enterprise.
