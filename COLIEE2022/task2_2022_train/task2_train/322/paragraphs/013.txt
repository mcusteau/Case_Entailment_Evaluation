Now, it is clear that despite William's insistence at trial that he wanted his shares and he wanted them from day one, he really flinched at insisting because, as he said, in Exhibit 25 at p. 2, he was greatly concerned about the possibility of causing Northland and Cantex to become associated and he "... did not know how to acquire these shares without jeopardizing my position with the Drilling Companies. ..." (Exhibit 25, p. 2.) Therefore, although the brothers hatched an oral agreement about prospective shareholdings, when the moment of truth, the incorporation, arrived William flinched and, together, they agreed not to agree, but rather to postpone the time for concluding an agreement about Cantex. It is equally clear that John treated William's provision of equipment and his seed money as loans to be paid off eventually.
