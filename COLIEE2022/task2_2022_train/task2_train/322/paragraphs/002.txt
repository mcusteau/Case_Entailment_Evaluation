The matter in issue in each case is whether or not the plaintiff corporations were associated, pursuant to s. 256 of the Income Tax Act, with Northland Drilling & Construction Co. Ltd. (hereinafter: Northland). A secondary issue, which becomes important if such association be adjudged to exist is whether the Minister was statute-barred from effecting any reassessment of the plaintiffs for the taxation years 1978 to and through 1981, as provided in s. 152(4) of the Act. The plaintiff 1056 Enterprises was, at all material times, officially known as Cantex Engineering & Construction Co. Ltd. (hereinafter: Cantex) having effected a change of name, shown by Exhibit 1, on February 28, 1985. The parties' lawyers and the witnesses all referred to this plaintiff as Cantex.
