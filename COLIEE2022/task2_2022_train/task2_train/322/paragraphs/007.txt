Northland was incorporated in Alberta on January 5, 1961, and for almost a decade, until about 1970 or 1971 according to William, brother John was a nominal incorporating shareholder, as shown in Exhibit 13, a copy of Northland's certificate of incorporation. The material time begins in 1970. John had been working as a professional engineer in the British Columbian ministry of highways, having started as an undergraduate in 1955. By contrast, his brother William averred that he himself had never attained Grade 8 standing, but as with many persons, that lack of high school education did not noticeably impair his knowledgeability and success in business. However when John indicated he was considering going into a private professional consulting practice, Bill suggested, rather that he would sponsor John's going into the construction equipment rental business.
