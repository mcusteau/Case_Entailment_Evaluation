Mr. Rodger did not interview John Pankiw, Mr. Dewdney, Mr. Roach or Mr. Thorsteinsson. He spoke with Mr. Drossos, now Judge Drossos, who was then John's solicitor, only in the offices of Revenue Canada in the presence of the plaintiffs' counsel. Mr. Rodger noted the original oral agreement of the brothers which had been dissolved before the Cantex shares were issued, in favour of some vague indication of some future agreement or rationalization of their interests. Mr. Rodger did not appreciate that fact, but rather concluded that the roughly 50-50 division of shares in Cantex continued all along through the years in issue. Based on that mistake, his conclusion, not unnaturally, was that the companies were associated and had misrepresented the facts in their respective income tax returns. Mr. Rodger did interview William Pankiw and reviewed his affidavit filed on January 9, 1984, in proceedings taken by John and the plaintiff in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for enforcement of the arbitration award rendered by Mr. Thorsteinsson.
