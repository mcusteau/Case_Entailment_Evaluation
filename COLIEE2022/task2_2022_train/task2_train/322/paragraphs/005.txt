This is a sad story of the increasingly bitter conflict between the brothers Pankiw. It proves the validity of the old adage that "good papers make good friends" and, one might add, could have served to preserve brotherly love in this case, if only the brothers had known what mutual agreement to inscribe on paper. There was no written agreement, there was no enduring oral agreement; and the papers were all futilely inscribed to patch over the widening gulf between the two brothers, and never legally delivered even if some few were signed and sealed, except, in effect, to submit their disagreements to binding arbitration.
