Muldoon, J.
: These reasons apply to eight actions instituted in regard to income taxation, including the case at bar. The others are:
(1) by this plaintiff, allegedly for the taxation year noted in regard to the suit number:

taxation year 1982
T-2531-86

(2) by Paradise Industries Ltd., plaintiff, allegedly for the taxation year noted in regard to the suit number:
T-2534-86
taxation year 1982
T-2535-86

In fact each of the plaintiffs' respective statements of claim is formulated in the same terms in that each seeks relief by the vacating of notices of reassessment issued by the Minister of National Revenue (hereinafter: the Minister) for all of this plaintiff's taxation years and both of Paradise Industries Ltd.'s taxation years above listed. Since these reasons for judgment will serve for reasons in all of the cases, a copy is to be placed on each of the court's files in this matter.
