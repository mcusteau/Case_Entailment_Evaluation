If as the Minister contends, William indirectly owned up to 50% of the issued shares of Cantex, he could have enhanced the value of his alleged indirectly owned registered shares by permitting the Wiltse lands to become an asset of Cantex, and obtained repayment of the $52,500.00 purchase price from Cantex as yet another loan made to it. He wanted nothing to do with that proposition. Indeed, William caused Ellis Creek Holdings Ltd. to be incorporated and to take title to the Wiltse gravel land. William obtained shares as consideration for that "tax rollover". So he testified as recorded in the transcript: volume 4, p. 358. A subsequent proposal for a partnership between Cantex and Ellis Creek was drafted (part of Exhibit 9) but it, too, came to naught. Cantex paid no royalties for the gravel which was in fact extracted for its construction projects. Moreover no portions of Cantex's earnings nor yet any dividends of the corporation were ever paid to William or to Northland.
