[25]
None of the allegations upon which the Minister proceeded to base the reassessments as if the plaintiffs and Northland were associated corporations withstands the evidence and the weight of evidence before the court. Corporations cannot be or become associated merely by what their principals thought or might have done. It takes an agreement or declaration or some legally efficacious mechanism or regime to effect the association defined in s. 256 of the Act. In effect the Minister was pursuing a will-o'-the-wisp because of the mistaken belief that the brothers' initial oral agreement survived and operated at all material times. It ceased before the brothers could carry it into effect, directly or even indirectly, in regard to the shareholdings in Cantex. It ceased forever, because of William's refusal to accept shares, with John's acquiescence or full agreement in such refusal, and no such agreement was ever again forged and consummated. The arbitration proceedings and subsequent court proceedings do not bear relevantly on this issue.
