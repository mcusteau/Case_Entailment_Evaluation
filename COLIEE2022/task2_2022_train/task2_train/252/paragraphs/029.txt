Mr. Zündel would have us believe that he knew Marc Lemire for the "photocopying work" Mr. Lemire did for him. Yet Marc Lemire has been and still is very active in Heritage Front, which he now leads, and an active participant in internet services, notably the "Freedom Site" which offers links to extreme right-wing groups of Canada. Marc Lemire has in fact received financial assistance from Mr. Zündel, and again, I believe the nature of their relationship is much closer than what Mr. Zündel admits. I find somewhat unbelievable that they would never have discussed any matter related to Heritage Front or the internet, given their presence in cyberspace through various sites. Similarly, I believe Mr. Zündel had more extensive contacts with Bernard Klatt, a computer expert who provided internet services to various extremist groups, than what Mr. Zündel stated.
