, supra, there were serious gaps in the history of the respondent. Although the evidence presented by witnesses in favour of the respondent was compelling, Justice Noël points out that the evidence is recent, and does not explain a period of Mr. Charkaoui's life where he is suspected of having linked up with terrorist elements.
