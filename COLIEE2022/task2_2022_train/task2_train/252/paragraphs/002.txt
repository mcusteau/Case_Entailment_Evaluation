[2]
In my capacity as a designated judge pursuant to section 76 and subsection 83(1) of the
IRPA
, I commenced reviewing the continuance of the detention within 48 hours of Mr. Zündel's arrest. The only issue to be decided in this case is whether the detention of Mr. Zündel should be continued, pending the decision on the reasonableness of the security certificate.
