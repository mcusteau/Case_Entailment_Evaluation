Similarly, in Mr. Z端ndel's case, there are gaps that need to be explained. Mr. Z端ndel's activities have in large part been public. In the context of these public endeavours, Mr. Z端ndel has never advocated violence. This has been the basis of his position throughout the hearing. How can defending ideas, however unpopular or insulting, pose a safety concern for Canada? After all, argue his lawyers, Mr. Z端ndel has been repeating the same things for over twenty years, and he has never been prosecuted for any crime, including hate propaganda. He was charged with an offence - spreading false news - which the Supreme Court has since declared unconstitutional (see
R. v. Zundel (No. 2)
, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 731; 140 N.R. 1; 56 O.A.C. 161). The Canadian Human Rights Tribunal has ordered him to change the content of the Zundelsite (see
Citron v. Zundel
, [2002] C.H.R.D. No. 1), but, again according to his lawyers, a regulatory offence hardly amounts to a threat to national security.
