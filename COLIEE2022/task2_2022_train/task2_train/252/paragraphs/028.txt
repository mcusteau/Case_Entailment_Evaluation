Mr. Zündel knows Wolfgang Droege, another "acquaintance" and co-founder of the Heritage Front. Mr. Droege, before coming to Canada and founding the Heritage Front, was convicted and sentenced to three years' imprisonment in the United States for an attempted coup on Dominica. Mr. Zündel maintains that he and Mr. Droege only discussed history matters. I find this difficult to believe, if only because of frequent contacts with Mr. Droege and the latter's rather active role in terrorist activities.
