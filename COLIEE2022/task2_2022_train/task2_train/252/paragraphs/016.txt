Charkaoui, Re
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1119; 237 F.T.R. 143 (F.C.), Justice NoÃ«l of this Court had to deal with exactly the same provisions and had to decide on whether to maintain the detention of Mr. Charkaoui, a Moroccan citizen for whom a certificate had issued and who was being detained pursuant to section 82(1). He states thus the applicable standard of proof, at para. 39:
"Thus, the designated judge is not to look for proof of the existence of the facts but rather to analyze the proof as a whole while asking himself whether it is sufficient for a person to have a reasonable belief that there is a danger to national security or the safety of any person or that the respondent will avoid the procedure or removal. Although it is not at the level of the preponderance of probabilities, this standard must tend toward a serious possibility of the existence of facts based on reliable and justifiable evidence. To this effect, Mr. Justice Evans of the Court of Appeal wrote, in
Chiau v. Canada (M.C.I.)
, [2001] 2 F.C. 297, at paragraph 60:
'As for whether there were "reasonable grounds" for the officer's belief, I agree with the Trial Judge's definition of "reasonable grounds" (supra, at paragraph 27, page 658) as a standard of proof that, while falling short of a balance of probabilities, nonetheless connotes "a bona fide belief in a serious possibility based on credible evidence."

Attorney General of Canada v. Jolly
, [1975] F.C. 216 (F.C.A.).'"
