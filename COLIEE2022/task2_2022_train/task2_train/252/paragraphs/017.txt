The standard is thus defined as "a bona fide belief in a serious possibility based on credible evidence". If the Ministers provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that detention must be continued for reasons of national security or to ensure the safety of any person, the onus shifts to Mr. Zündel to provide evidence to challenge the conclusion that detention should be maintained. I understand the predicament for Mr. Zündel and his counsel caused by not being apprised of all the evidence against Mr. Zündel. However, Mr. Zündel had the opportunity to present evidence, and knew that the gist of the case against him was his link to individuals and groups who advocate violence against certain groups in our society. In this case, my conclusion is that the Ministers have met their burden, and that Mr. Zündel has not.
