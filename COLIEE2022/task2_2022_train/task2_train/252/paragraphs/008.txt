It should be noted from the start that the grounds to continue the detention are much narrower than the grounds of inadmissibility. Whereas inadmissibility defined in sections 33 to 37 covers more than security and includes such grounds as human rights violations or criminality, the test for continued detention requires the designated judge to consider only two criteria:
a) whether the person detained is a danger to national security or to the safety of any person, and
b) whether the person is unlikely to appear at a proceeding for removal.
1) Whether Mr. ZÃ¼ndel is a danger to national security or to the safety of any person.
