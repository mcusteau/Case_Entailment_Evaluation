Mr. ZÃ¼ndel, from all the evidence I have seen, seems to want to have it both ways: he wants to be seen as a thinker who rejects violence as a means of gaining power, yet he does nothing to distance himself from groups and individuals, here and abroad, who have been involved in violent activities and still are. Thus, while overtly condemning the use of violence, he covertly condones it by maintaining his contact and credibility with groups that advocate and engage in violent acts.
