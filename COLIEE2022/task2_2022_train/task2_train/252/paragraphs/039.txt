I believe that one significant factor has been omitted by both sides: the fact that the temptation for Mr. Zündel not to appear would be much greater than it has been in the past. If the certificate is held to be reasonable, no appeal is possible, and a removal order is then in force. Mr. Zündel this time faces more than deportation: he faces certain prosecution in Germany. The German Government has already laid charges against him, charges that he will face if and when he returns to Germany. This is a factor which would seem to deserve some consideration. However, as I stated, the threat to national security is sufficient in itself to justify continuing the detention.
