On March 3, 1992, the Access to Information Coordinator of PWC, Atlantic Region, wrote to the applicant in relation to a request received by the Department pursuant to the
Act
for records relating to "why the idea of a tunnel was dismissed in favour of a bridge proposal as one of the options to create a fixed link between P.E.I. and the mainland". PWC advised that it had in its possession records containing information (the "Record") relating to the applicant, that this might contain information as described in s. 20(1) of the
Act
but they did not have sufficient information to substantiate this, and as required by the
Act
the Department intended to disclose the Record if written representation as to why the Record should not be disclosed were not received within 20 days from receipt of that notice by the applicant. Any representations made would result in a review of the Department's decision to disclose the Record.
