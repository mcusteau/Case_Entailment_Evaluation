[43]
Having examined the Record and the Proposal, it is not self-evident to me from the documents themselves that the applicant, whatever may be its concerns, has demonstrated a basis for "a reasonable expectation of probable harm". That is the standard enunciated and applied by Mr. Justice MacGuigan in
Canada Packers
, supra. The applicant does not demonstrate probable harm as a reasonable expectation from disclosure of the Record and the Proposal simply by affirming by affidavit that disclosure "would undoubtedly result in material financial loss and prejudice" to the applicant or would "undoubtedly interfere with contractual and other negotiations of SNC-Lavalin in future business dealings". These affirmations are the very findings the court must make if paragraphs 20(1)(c) and (d) are to apply. Without further explanation based on evidence that establishes those outcomes are reasonably probable, the court is left to speculate and has no basis to find the harm necessary to support application of these provisions.
