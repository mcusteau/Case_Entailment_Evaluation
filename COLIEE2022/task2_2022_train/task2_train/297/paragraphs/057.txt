Costs were requested by the respondent. My conclusions support the position adopted by the respondent Minister, in part on procedural grounds. If on appeal I were to be found in error on procedural grounds, that in my view preclude review by the court of the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal, as indicated I would have ordered that a portion of the Proposal, mainly the volumes relating to the applicant's financial plan, were exempt from disclosure under paragraph 20(1)(b). In these circumstances, it seems to me each party should bear its own costs.
