[49]
The applicant clearly expressed particular concern, through counsel at the hearing and by references within the Proposal itself, that the financial information was to be treated as confidential. I note that financial statements of the applicant, which was not then a public company, were said to be included in a sealed envelope with the volume devoted to financial information, to be used only for the evaluation of the applicant's proposal and not to be made public under any circumstances. Whether by coincidence or good management those particular statements of Lavalin Inc., to which the applicant SNC-Lavalin Inc. is successor, are not included in the sealed Proposal documents provided to the court under the confidential affidavit of Mr. MacCoul. Those statements, said to have been submitted to PWC in a sealed envelope, which, until persuaded otherwise, I infer are confidential under paragraph 20(1)(b), may not be disclosed under the
Act
for the process established by the
Act
for their possible disclosure has not been followed by the respondent.
