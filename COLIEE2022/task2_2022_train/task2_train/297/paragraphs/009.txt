By a second letter of March 10, 1992, from the Access to Information Coordinator, PWC Atlantic Region to the applicant, the applicant was advised that the Department had received a request for records relating to "data submitted by bridge consortiums, assessment of bridge proposals ...". The applicant was advised that PWC considered that the request related to information including the bridge Proposal submitted by the applicant in relation to the Northumberland Strait Crossing Project. While PWC believed the Proposal might contain information as described in paragraphs 20(1)(a) to (d) of the
Act
it did not have sufficient information to substantiate this. It proposed to disclose the Proposal subject to consideration of any objection the applicant might have to that proposed course of action, which objection should be received within 20 days of the notice provided.
