[24]
For the respondent it is urged that these rules, 421 and 422, concern pleadings in actions in the court, commenced by Statement of Claim, as defined by rule 2 which provides, in part:
"'action' means a proceeding in the Trial Division other than an appeal, an application or an originating motion, and includes such a proceeding by or against the Crown or any person acting for or on behalf of the Crown;
. . . . .
'pleading' means any document whereby an action in the Trial Division was initiated or a claim in such an action was defined, and any document, whereby a claim was defended or answered, and includes a confession of judgment and a discontinuance."
I agree that those Rules relate to actions in the court, and this proceeding by an application under s. 44(1) of the
Act
is not an action.
