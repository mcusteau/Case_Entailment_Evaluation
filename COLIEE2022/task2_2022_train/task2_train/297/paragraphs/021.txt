In my view, the purpose of the limitation period described by the applicant may be one effect of failure to apply to the court within the prescribed period, but the purpose is broader than merely providing protection from recourse, or a reply to objections, made after 20 days by an objecting third party. The ultimate purpose of the
Act
is to provide access to information when requested, except for specified exceptional cases, and in a timely fashion, to the requester. In view of that purpose of the
Act
, the procedures established to deal with objections by a third party, to whom the information sought by a requester relates, must serve the purpose of providing a reasonable but limited time for the third party to object and for consideration of objections received, before a final determination about disclosure of the information. If the main purpose of the
Act
is to be served, the time limit fixed by s. 44(1) must, in the ordinary course, be construed as it was by Strayer, J., in
Schneider
, supra, that is, the time limit is to be strictly applied. The court has no discretion under the
Act
to extend the time for filing or to consider the application filed late. Except possibly in an extraordinary case, to which I refer below, where application is made later than the 20 days limited by s. 44(1), the matter sought to be reviewed cannot be considered to be properly within the jurisdiction of the court. In my opinion, while the court may have discretion to consider the matter in an exceptional case, unless the case be truly exceptional, it will dismiss the application. Thus, I find that the application made in Court File T-1133-92, filed later than the period prescribed by s. 44(1), must be dismissed. There is no application for an extension of time and no argument that this is an exceptional case.
