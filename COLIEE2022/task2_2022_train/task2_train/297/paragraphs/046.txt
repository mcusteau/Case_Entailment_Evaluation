The application of the principle of severability and of s. 25 was not addressed in argument by counsel. The only portion of the proposal specifically referred to by the applicant, a volume in its Proposal that contains financial information, was referred to primarily as illustrative of the material in the Proposal that is exempt from disclosure under paragraph 20(1)(b) and not to suggest that other portions might be disclosed. Essentially the applicant's position is that the entire Proposal consists of confidential, financial, commercial, scientific or technical information and the full Proposal is exempt from disclosure. Essentially the respondent's position is that there is no evidence that the information in the Proposal is confidential in nature, thus the whole Proposal should be released.
