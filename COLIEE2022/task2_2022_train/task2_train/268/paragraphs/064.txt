The evidence of Mr. Windross is that Novopharm's business interests could be severely and negatively affected if excerpts from Novopharm's submission were publicly disclosed and thereby obtained by another generic pharmaceutical company. There is substantial evidence before this Court, says Novopharm, both from Mr. Windross and Mr. Mason, that these documents would be of interest and useful to Novopharm's competitors in developing their own products to compete with Novopharm or to interfere in the approval of Novopharm's product. Novopharm proposes, therefore, that it is completely reasonable to believe that in the highly competitive generic drug industry, what is useful to its competitors would be detrimental to Novopharm.
