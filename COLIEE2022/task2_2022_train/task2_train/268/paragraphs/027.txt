[27]
The Appeals raise the following issues:
(a) Are the Orders clearly wrong, in the sense that the exercise of Prothonotary Milczynski's discretion was based upon a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts?
(b) If so, upon a de novo review by this Court, is Novopharm entitled to a protective order in the form sought? This issue is composed of the following subsidiary issues:
(i) should a protective order be granted as a result of the combined effect of the Disclosure Order, s. 6(7) and (8) of the
Regulations
and rules 151 and 152 of the
Federal Court Rules
, or
(ii) in the alternative (or in any event) should a protective order be granted on the grounds that Novopharm has met the normal test for the issuance of such orders?
(c) From Abbott's perspective, did Prothonotary Milczynski err by going beyond the evidentiary record and ordering that some information should be included in the Protective Order?
