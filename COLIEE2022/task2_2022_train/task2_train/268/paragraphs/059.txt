In this case, Novopharm submits that the test for the issuance of a protective order has been met. The evidence shows that Novopharm has a subjective belief that the information is confidential and that its interests would be harmed by its disclosure. The evidence also shows that the information has been treated as confidential and that Novopharm's belief that its interests could be harmed by the disclosure is reasonable. By choosing not to challenge Mr. Windross' evidence on cross-examination and by only filing the evidence of an individual (Dr. Liston) who cannot speak for Health Canada, has never worked in the generic drug industry and is not an expert in the confidentiality of documents, Novopharm says that Abbott did not adduce any meaningful evidence to contradict the clear and convincing evidence of Mr. Windross.
