What appears at first glance to be a conflict between the mandatory language of s. 6(8) and the discretionary language of Rule 151 is resolved on closer scrutiny. Section 6(7) provides the means for disclosure, and s. 6(8) decrees that any documents so produced will be treated as confidential, until such time as the confidentiality of the material is established, in accordance with Rule 151, either as a matter of legislative fiat or Court order. In the context of the present case Novopharm could not establish confidentiality under a legislative provision and so had to proceed by way of Rule 151 to seek a Court Order in accordance with the governing jurisprudence.
