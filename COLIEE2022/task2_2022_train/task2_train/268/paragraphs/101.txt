Novopharm says that these conclusions on the evidence are clearly wrong for a variety of reasons:
(a) Dr. Liston never dealt with an ANDS in the context of the
Regulations
during his time at Health Canada, which ended in 1992. He may know the general form of submission but he has no knowledge of the actual contents of Novopharm's submission;
(b) Dr. Liston admitted on cross-examination that he did not regard himself as an expert in the area of confidentiality of documents;
(c) Most of Dr. Liston's evidence is purported expert opinion evidence regarding what information might be in Novopharm's submission and whether the material would be confidential. Dr. Liston was not qualified as an expert in accordance with the principles established in
R. v. Mohan
, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9; 166 N.R. 245; 71 O.A.C. 241, at p. 20 so that the expert opinion portions of his evidence are just not admissible;
(d) There is no evidence before the Court from Health Canada to rectify the deficiencies in Dr. Liston's evidence or to challenge the evidence of Mr. Windross;
(e) Prothonotary Milczynski was clearly wrong to prefer the unqualified and inadmissible expert opinion evidence of Dr. Liston over the direct fact evidence of Mr. Windross;
(f) Prothonotary Milczynski was also clearly wrong in holding that Mr. Windross' evidence was general and vague and speculative in comparison with the evidence of Dr. Liston;
(g) The evidence of Dr. Liston and the analysis of Prothonotary Milczynski incorrectly focus on the information within the documents, rather than the documents themselves.
