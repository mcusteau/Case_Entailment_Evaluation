In conjunction with the strict regime mandated by Rule 152, Rule 151 of the
Federal Court Rules
provides the Court with specific authority to issue protective orders to ensure that confidential materials are treated confidentially both before and after filing, while also allowing for those materials to be provided to individuals other than the solicitors of record in appropriate circumstances. However, before issuing a protective order under Rule 151(2) the Court "must be satisfied that the material should be treated as confidential."
