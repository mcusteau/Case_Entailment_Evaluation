This meant that Novopharm did not satisfy the onus imposed in the
Sierra Club
test in various ways:
(a) Other than the exceptions identified by Prothonotary Milczynski, no specific information or material was identified as requiring protection. Novopharm merely relied upon a blanket assertion that all of its documents were confidential. This was obviously not supportable because some of those documents contained information that was already in the public domain;
(b) Because there was no specificity, Novopharm was unable to demonstrate a legally relevant interest in the confidentiality of the materials, and thus was unable to identify a corresponding public interest that would justify the blanket order which it sought;
(c) The lack of specificity also meant that Novopharm was unable to make out a convincing case for ensuing harm and chose to rely instead upon a general and speculative assertion that disclosure of any of the documents would give competitors an unfair advantage.
