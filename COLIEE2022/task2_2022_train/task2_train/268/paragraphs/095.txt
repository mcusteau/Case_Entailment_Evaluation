I cannot say that such an approach is clearly wrong. Section 6(8) is only applicable to a "document produced under s. 6(7)" and s. 6(7) provides a discretionary means for the Court to order, on motion by a "first person" (in this case the Applicants), that a "second person" (in this case Novopharm) produce portions of the NOC submission relevant to the disposition of the issues in the proceedings. If this is done, the recipient of a document produced as part of that process must treat the document confidentially. This does not mean that the document is deemed to be confidential for other purposes and other stages of the proceedings. In coming to Court for an order under Rule 151, Novopharm acted in accordance with Prothonotary Milczynski's reading of the effect of s. 6(8). If s. 6(7) deemed a document to be confidential for all purposes, then Rule 152 would apply automatically and there would be no need for a discretionary decision under Rule 151.
