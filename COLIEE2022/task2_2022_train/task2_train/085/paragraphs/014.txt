  The first error identified by the applicant in the officer's decision is the lack of credibility given to the applicant's description of his main tasks in his application for permanent residence: allegations made by the applicant are presumed true, unless there are reasons to doubt them ( 
 Maldonado v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1980] 2 F.C. 302 at 305). However, the respondent rightly asserts that the officer did have reasons to doubt the applicant's description: it was a verbatim copy of the tasks listed in NOC 0631.
