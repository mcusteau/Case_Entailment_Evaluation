  The case at hand is in the context of an eligibility determination by a visa officer: it is not the same type of decision as those where an obligation has been imposed on administrative agencies to mention specific evidence in their decisions. Moreover, if the applicant wishes to impose these same obligations on visa officers, it must then not be forgotten that a mere statement by an administrative authority that it considered the evidence in making its decision usually suffices to meet its obligation: the visa officer's statement that the applicant "did not provide satisfactory evidence" would fulfill his would-be obligation (

  (1998), 157 F.T.R. 35).
