  The applicable standard of review to the officer's decision of ineligibility is reasonableness, being a question of mixed facts and law ( 
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190 [ 
 Dunsmuir 
 ]). Essentially, a review of the officer's assessment of the evidence must be done according to a standard of reasonableness ( 
 Kuhathasan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 ), 2008 FC 457 at para 17 [ 
 Kuhathasan 
 ]). Therefore, this Court must determine whether the officer's decision falls within the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible in respect of the facts and the law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
  at para 47).
