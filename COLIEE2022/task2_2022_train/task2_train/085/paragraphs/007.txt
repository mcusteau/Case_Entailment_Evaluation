 [7] 
  The reason for refusal is identified in the letter as there being insufficient evidence of the applicant's work experience in the listed occupation, thereby failing to meet the requirements set out in the Ministerial Instructions: 
 
 
 
 . . . the main duties that you listed do not indicate that you performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation, as set out in the occupational descriptions of the NOC. I am therefore not satisfied that you are a Restaurant and Food Service Manager (0631). 
 
 
 
 Since you did not provide satisfactory evidence that you have work experience in any of the listed occupations, you do not meet the requirements of the Ministerial Instructions and your application is not eligible for processing.
