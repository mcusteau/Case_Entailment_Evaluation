In my view, in construing section 44(1) of the
Act
, the proper approach is that the subsection should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the plain meaning of its terms. In my view, the language of section 44(1) is plain and admits of only one meaning. In these circumstances, the court is required to give effect to the language used by Parliament. The application to review the decision must be filed with this court within 20 days after the notice is given. This court, under the current
Act
, has no power to extend this time after it has expired.
