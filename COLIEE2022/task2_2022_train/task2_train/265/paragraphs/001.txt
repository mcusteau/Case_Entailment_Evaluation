Richard, J.
: The issue which the applicant raises in this motion is whether this court can extend the time within which to make an application to this court for a review of a decision to disclose a record or a part thereof made by the head of a government institution pursuant to section 44(1) of the
Access to Information Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1, (the
Act
), and if so, in what circumstances. Section 44(1) of the
Act
reads as follows:
"44(1) Any third party to whom the head of a government institution is required under paragraph 28(1)(b) or subsection 29(1) to give a notice of a decision to disclose a record or a part thereof under this Act may, within twenty days after the notice is given, apply to the court for a review of the matter."
