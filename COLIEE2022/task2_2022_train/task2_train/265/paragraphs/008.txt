Counsel for the applicant did refer me to a decision of Mr. Justice MacKay of the trial division of this court in
SNC-Lavalin Inc. v. Canada (Minister of Public Works)
, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1059; 79 F.T.R. 113 (T.D.). There the learned trial judge held that the provisions of section 44(1) of the
Act
were to be treated as mandatory, but went on to suggest that there was a residual discretion to extend time which was only to be exercised in exceptional circumstances. However, in the case before Mr. Justice MacKay, no application for leave to extend the time was before him.
