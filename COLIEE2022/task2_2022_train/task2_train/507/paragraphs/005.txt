The Medical Statement signed on discharge requires an outgoing member to state whether or not he or she has sustained an injury attributable to service by either striking out the word(s) "have" or "have not" that precede the words "suffered an injury" on the form. The applicant's form shows that the words "have not" are struck out, but the word "not" has been inserted in handwriting, uninitialled and undated, behind the word "have". The form thus reads "I ... have not suffered an injury ...". The applicant denies having inserted the word "not". The Medical Statement form also states that where an affirmative answer is given to the question of whether an injury was suffered, a medical examination is required. As noted, there is no medical examination report on the applicant's military record.
