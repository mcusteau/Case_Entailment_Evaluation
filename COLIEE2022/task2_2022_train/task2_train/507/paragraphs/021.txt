An often quoted principle used in evaluating evidence is that greater weight is generally given to statements made prior to a legal claim being made than to those made at the time of the claim, or in contemplation of the claim. The earlier statements will not likely have been framed with the subsequent claim in mind. I am not saying that the applicant's evidence is not true, but only that the decision-makers below had the unenviable job of evaluating his 1995 evidence concerning the cause of the injury with the documentary evidence from 1984. They chose to rely on the latter and particularly the absence of any medical statement on discharge referring to the injury.
