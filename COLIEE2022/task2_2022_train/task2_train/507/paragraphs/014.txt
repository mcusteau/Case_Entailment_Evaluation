The decision dated September 5, 1997, by the Board on reconsidering its earlier decision in the applicant's case reads in part:
"This Board cannot agree with that argument presented by the Advocate. In the first place,
the record
, as it pertains to Mr. Hall's Regular Force service,
does not disclose any evidence of complaints nor treatment in service
. This Board carried out a complete review of Mr. Hall's service documents and did not reveal any complaints or abnormal findings. This Board did not view any Reports on Injuries or any documentation of any kind which indicated any injury or complaints of injury during Regular Force service.
"In once more reviewing the whole of this application as required by this application for reconsideration,
this Board maintains that Dr. Lovell's opinion is not supported by x-ray documentation and is based on historical information provided by the applicant
.
"In other words, this Board is of the opinion that
Dr. Lovell's letter of 20 December 1996 and the opinion contained therein cannot be supported by the Record
." (underlining added)
