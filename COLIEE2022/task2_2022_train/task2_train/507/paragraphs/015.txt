The applicant argues that the Board's decision is flawed because: (1) it did not resolve doubts in weighing the evidence in his favour as required by subss. 30(a) and (c) of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
; the absence of a medical examination on discharge on his file should not be held against him; (2) it applied an inappropriate legal test in concluding that the medical evidence was inadequate to support his claim when both opinions were framed in terms of probability, not possibility; (3) it ignored relevant evidence, his own, without making an express finding of lack of credibility and stating reasons therefore, contrary to subs. 39(b); (4) it erred in its statement of the facts in stating that there was no x-ray documentation to support Dr. Lovell's opinion.
