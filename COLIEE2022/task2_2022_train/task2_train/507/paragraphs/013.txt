In the
MacKay
case the Board had refused to consider, on a reconsideration hearing, new medical evidence that was sought to be adduced. Mr. Justice Teitelbaum held that under the applicable legislation the Board had an obligation to consider such evidence. He also commented that expert medical evidence that speaks in terms of probabilities, not possibilities, could not be considered to be speculation, and he made reference to the decision in
Moar v. Canada (Attorney General)
(1995), 103 F.T.R. 314 (T.D.). The principle drawn from
Moar
was that unless the medical evidence is found not to be credible it must be accepted by the Board, if uncontradicted; if found not credible, reasons must be given for that finding.
