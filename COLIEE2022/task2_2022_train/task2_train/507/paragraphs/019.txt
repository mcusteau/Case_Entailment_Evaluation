Each decision respecting the applicant's application for a disability pension denied the application on the ground that there was no medical documentation in the 1983-1984 period attesting to an injury or complaint. While the applicant correctly asserts that uncontradicted evidence by him should be accepted unless a lack of credibility finding is made, and that every reasonable inference should be drawn, and any reasonable doubt resolved in his favour, he still has the obligation to demonstrate that the medical difficulty from which he now suffers arose out of or in connection with his military service; that is, the causal linkage must be established.
