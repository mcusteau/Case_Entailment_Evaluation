The Board had before it: the applicant's evidence concerning his fall into the crevasse; his assertion that he reported this as a service injury on discharge for which assertion there is no supporting documentary evidence and indeed documentary evidence that contradicts it; his evidence that he sought medical attention in 1987-1988 from his family doctor who took x-rays, which x-rays the applicant states he imagines "were destroyed long ago"; the more recent 1996 medical evidence of Drs. Pietrangelo and Lovell who attest to the present neck problems from which the applicant suffers but whose evidence concerning the initial cause thereof can come only from the applicant's description of the events that occurred. The Board weighed this evidence and found it could not conclude that the applicant's present problems were related to the events of 1983-1984.
