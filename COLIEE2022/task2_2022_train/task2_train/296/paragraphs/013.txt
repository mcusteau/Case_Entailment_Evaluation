I would certainly agree with plaintiff's counsel that the form of the election may vary from case to case. I would also agree that the fiscal considerations involved as far as taxes are involved are not at opposite poles. It is not a section of the statute which provides complete relief to a taxpayer if an election is made or otherwise no relief at all if an election is not made. Absent an election, tax is payable on the basis of the spread between the adjusted cost base of the taxpayer's property which in this case is admitted to be $11,500 and the deemed value of disposition which the Crown fixed at $50,000. The result is a gross capital gain of $38,500 and a taxable gain of $19,250. The effect of it, however, because the two properties were of equal value, is that the taxpayer thereafter enjoys an adjusted cost base not of $11,500 but of $50,000. Some taxpayers, depending on their individual circumstances or their future plans or on the nature of any particular capital asset might very well be happy with an earlier tax bite and an easier one later. Others would choose the election route thereby postponing any tax liability to a remote future date.
