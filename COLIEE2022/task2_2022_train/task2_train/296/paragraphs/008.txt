On a reading of s. 44 of the
Income Tax Act
, the form of an election thereunder is not quite clear. Some assistance, though not necessarily determinative, may be had from paragraph 2(e) of
Interpretation Bulletin IT-259R2
, which states that in order to benefit from the tax deferral, the taxpayer must make a valid election. In paragraph 7 of that same bulletin it is stated:
"7. A taxpayer must elect to have the provisions of subs. 44(1), 13(4) and 14(6) apply.
The election should be made as follows
:
(a) If the disposition and replacement takes [sic] place in the
same year, the calculation of
the recaptured capital cost allowance, the amount payable (net of outlays or expenses) under subparagraph 14(5)(a)(iv) by reason of subs. 14(6)
or the capital gain under the provisions of subs. 13(4) or 44(1) in the taxpayer's return of income will be considered to constitute an election
.
(b) If the property is not replaced until a
subsequent year
, the election should take the form of a
letter
attached to the return of income for the year the replacement property is acquired. The letter should include a description of the replacement property and the former property, a request for an adjustment to the recapture of capital cost allowance, the taxable capital gain reported or the amount included in income by virtue of subs. 14(1) in a prior year, and a calculation of the revised recapture, taxable capital gain or cumulative eligible capital.
(c) If the replacement property is acquired
prior
to the year of disposition of the property, the election to apply subsections ..., 44(1) ... should take the form of a
letter
attached to a return of income for the year in which the replacement property is acquired ..." (underlining mine)
