Counsel for the plaintiff, in an adroit submission, argued that the simultaneous registration of the requisite deeds in the local registry office was tantamount to an election. That registration constituted public notice that an exchange of similar capital assets had taken place and such notice, in the light of the somewhat undefined meaning of the word "election" in s. 44 should satisfy the requirements of the statute. After all, pleaded counsel, the application of s. 44 is not to avoid taxes but to defer them to a later date. In the circumstances, only a minimum standard of "election" must be met.
