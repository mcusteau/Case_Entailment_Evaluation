In a letter dated June 18, 2003, Dr. Hung-Tat Lo, a psychiatrist qualified to practice in Ontario, and an Assistant Professor of Medicine, University of Toronto, confirmed that the applicant was seen in psychiatric assessment on May 27, 2003. Based on his assessment of the applicant, Dr. Hung-Tat Lo states as follows:
"In summary, my professional opinion is that Mr. Gorria is suffering from an adjustment disorder with features of a posttraumatic stress disorder. These are the direct consequence of his persecution in his home country. With the freer environment in Canada and the support available to him, prognosis is good. However, a return to his home country will have grave, adverse effect on his health."
