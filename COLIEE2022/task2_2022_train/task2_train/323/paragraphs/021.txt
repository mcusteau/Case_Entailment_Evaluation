For this reason, I find that the Board's decision in this regard is incongruous with the facts before it and the specific circumstances of the persecution the applicant suffered at the hands of the police, agents of the state.
Did the Board err in finding that the "compelling reasons" exception of subsection 108(4) is not applicable to the applicant's situation?
