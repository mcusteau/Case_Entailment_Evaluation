[6]
The Applicant raised five issues in his Memorandum:
a) Whether the Adjudicator erred in law in applying the incorrect standard of proof related to ss. 33 and 37 of
IRPA
;
b) Whether the Adjudicator erred in law in his assessment of the evidence, and made findings which were patently unreasonable;
c) Whether the Adjudicator erred in law in giving weight to police reports and the evidence of police officers concerning incidents which did not lead to criminal charges being laid, or where laid, did not results in convictions, but rather were withdrawn or dismissed;
d) Whether the Adjudicator erred in law in his definition of "organization" set out in s. 37(1)(a) of the
IRPA
, both in terms of ignoring evidence, and in terms of correctness;
e) Whether the Adjudicator erred in law in concluding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the Applicant was a member of the A.K. Kannan group.
