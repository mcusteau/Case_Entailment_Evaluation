In
Bruce (Township) v. Thornburn
(1987), 61 O.R.(2d) 321 (H.C.), Montgomery, J., said that "being" as it appeared in a statute could include "having been" where the "sense of the statute demands it or where there has been an obvious mistake". At page 351 he said:
"Section 1(i) -- 'being' or 'having been'
"If read literally, the last half of the present definition of 'subscriber' is redundant by virtue of the use of the word 'being' in the portion of the definition reading 'and also means a person who, being a subscriber as defined above'. Is the use of this word, an obvious mistake in the drafting of the re-enactment of the
Telephone Act
in 1954, to be corrected by the use of the words 'having been' (the words used from 1924 to 1954)?
"The parts of the definition of 'subscriber' after the words 'and also means a person who', would seem to be completely redundant by virtue of the word 'being'. In other words, any person already qualified under the earlier part of the definition of subscriber need not meet any further criteria. Meeting the additional criteria without qualifying under the first part of the definition accomplishes nothing. The error in the use of 'being' is confirmed and compounded by the use of the word 'also'.
"A statute should not be interpreted so as to render parts of it as 'mere surplusage or meaningless'. Where the sense of the statute demands it or where there has been an obvious mistake in drafting, the court has power to substitute another word or phrase for that which actually appears in the text of the
Act
