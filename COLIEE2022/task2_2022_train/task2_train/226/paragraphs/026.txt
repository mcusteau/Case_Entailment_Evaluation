I find therefore, that the Member committed no reasonable error in law when he found as he did at pages 30 and 55 of his Reasons:
(Page 30):
"Paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Act
"Paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Act
renders a permanent resident inadmissible to Canada for being a member of an organization that is believed on reasonable grounds to be or to have been engaged in activity that is part of a pattern of criminal activity planned and organized by a number of persons acting in concert in furtherance of the commission of an offence indictable under an Act of Parliament.
"Under s. 33 of the
Act
, facts constituting inadmissibility under s. 37 include, unless otherwise provided, those for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur."
(Page 55):
"The legal test cited in paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Act
is whether there are reasonable grounds for belief that an organization is or has been engaged in activity that is part of a pattern of criminal activity planned and organized by a number of persons acting in concert in furtherance of the commission of an indictable offence under an
Act
of Parliament. In my judgment, the evidence cited here provides more than reasonable grounds for such belief.
"On the foregoing reasoning, I conclude that Mr. Sittampalam is inadmissible as alleged under paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Act
insofar as he is a member of an organization that is believed on reasonable grounds to be or to have been engaged in activity that is part of a pattern of criminal activity planned and organized by a number of persons acting in concert in furtherance of the commission of offences punishable under the Act of Parliament by way of indictment."
