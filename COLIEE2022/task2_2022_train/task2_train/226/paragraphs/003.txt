An inquiry commenced in June 2002 and continued until August 2004. When the new
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(
IRPA
) came into force in June 2002, the inquiry continued under ss. 36 and 37 of that
Act
. It was conceded on behalf of the Applicant that, since he had been convicted for trafficking in narcotics in 1996 and received a sentence of more than six months, namely two years less a day, that he was a person as described in s. 36(1)(a) of
IRPA
. The inquiry, therefore, only concerned itself as to whether the Applicant was also a person described in s. 37(1)(a). The importance of the continuation of the inquiry in this way is that, since the Applicant's conviction bore a sentence of over six months but less than two years, no appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division could be made having regard to the provisions of s. 64(1) and (2) of
IRPA
unless it was found that the Applicant was not a person as described in s. 37(1)(a) of
IRPA
. Judicial review would remain the only remedy.
