After a lengthy hearing, the Member provided extensive reasons, 55 pages, in which he concluded at page 55:
"The legal test cited in paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Act
is whether there are reasonable grounds for belief that an organization is or has been engaged in activity that is part of a pattern of criminal activity planned and organized by a number of persons acting in concert in furtherance of the commission of an indictable offence under the Act of Parliament. In my judgement, the evidence cited here provides more than reasonable grounds for such belief.
"On the foregoing reasoning, I conclude that Mr. Sittampalam is inadmissible as alleged under paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Act
insofar as he is a member of an organization that is believed on reasonable grounds to be or to have been engaged in activity that is part of a pattern of criminal activity planned and organized by a number of persons acting in concert in furtherance of the commission of offences punishable under an Act of Parliament by way of indictment."
