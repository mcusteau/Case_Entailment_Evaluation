It is clear from s. 27(1)(a) of the
Immigration Regulations
that stays of departure orders are contemplated by the
Act
. A stay is an extraordinary discretionary remedy which will only be granted in special circumstances. It may be that an application who intends to abide by a departure order, to avoid the negative consequences of a deportation order, will present a case which justifies a stay. In my view, this court clearly has jurisdiction to stay a departure order in appropriate circumstances.
