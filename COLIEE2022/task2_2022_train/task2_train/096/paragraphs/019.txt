  The line of cases relied upon by the applicants (

  and  
 Mooker 
 , above;  
 Dharamraj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.C.J. No. 853, 2006 FC 674;  
 Pinter v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] F.C.J. No. 366, 2005 FC 296) imposes upon H&C Officers the requirement that the generalized risk of violence, or risks flowing from discrimination, be considered according to the appropriate test. It does not go so far as to require the Officer to conclude that discrimination and a risk of generalized violence always constitute undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
