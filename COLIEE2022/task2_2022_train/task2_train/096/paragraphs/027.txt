  I am of the opinion that the Officer carefully reviewed the documentary submissions of the applicants, as well as other documents, and acknowledged certain instances of discrimination and crime which the applicants might face if returned to Kenya. It was open to the Officer to prefer certain documentary evidence over other sources. The Officer was not bound by the previous determinations made in the context of a PRRA application or a refugee claim, since he must assess the facts on H&C grounds. Assessing documentary evidence as it related to the risk of undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship falls squarely within the functions of an H&C Officer. In the present case, the Officer did so diligently.
