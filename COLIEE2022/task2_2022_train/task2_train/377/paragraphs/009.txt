It is the applicant's submission that the immigration officer failed to comply with the duty of fairness. Specifically, the humanitarian and compassionate review took place through the medium of an exchange of letters without an interview. The respondent submits that the requirements of procedural fairness do not create substantive rights and that there is no obligation under s. 114(2) to conduct an interview or a hearing. The respondent acknowledges that procedural fairness requires a consideration of the entirety of the applicant's case, but that this occurred: the applicant's counsel was given the opportunity to make extensive written submissions.
