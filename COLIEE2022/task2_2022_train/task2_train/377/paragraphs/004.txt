At issue is the immigration officer's decision of 20 November, 1992. The relevant part of the letter is as follows:
"Your submission as well as other information on file was carefully and sympathetically reviewed in order to evaluate the merits of Ms. Thangarani Sellakkandu's case. Insufficient grounds exist to warrant processing of Mr. Navaratnam [sic] application in Canada, pursuant to s. 114(2) of the
Immigration Act
."
The immigration officer's reasons of 23 November are detailed and they provide a list of every factor or piece of evidence considered.
