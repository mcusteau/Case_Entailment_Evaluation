 [72] 
  I note that Justice Near, as he then was, certified a question on this issue in  
 JMSL 
 : 
 
 
 
 1. What is the nature of the risk, if any, to be assessed with respect to the humanitarian and compassionate considerations under section 25 of IRPA, as amended by the  
 Balanced Refugee Reform Act 
 ? 
 
 
 
 2. Does the exclusion from consideration on humanitarian and compassionate grounds of the "factors" taken into account in the determination of whether a person needs protection under section 96 or 97 of IRPA mean that the facts presented to the decision-maker in the application for protection may not be used in a determination of the "elements related to the hardships" faced by a foreign national under subsection 25(1.3) of IRPA?
