  In  
 Sha'er v Canada 
   
 (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 231, [2007] FCJ No 297, Justice Tremblay-Lamer noted that: 
 
 
 
 [7] It is well established, and the parties agree, that the proper test for H&C decisions is: considering all of the relevant circumstances, would the general obligation put on all foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence from abroad cause the applicant unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship ( 
 Baker v. Canada (M.C.I.), 
  [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817 at para. 17;  
 Legault v. Canada (M.C.I.), 
  [2002] 4 F.C. 358, 2002 FCA 125 at para. 23). Unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship encompasses the risk the applicant allegedly faces in her country of nationality, her level of integration in Canadian society and the consequences of her removal from Canada. 
 
 
 
 [8] There are significant analytical differences between H&C and PRRAs, as clearly stated by Chief Justice Allan Lutfy in  
 Pinter v. Canada (M.C.I.) 
 , [2005] F.C.J. No. 366 (QL), 2005 FC 296 at paragraphs 3-4 ...: 
 
 
 
 [9] I note that though the tests for H&C and PRRA matters are distinct, they are related, as held by Chief Justice Lutfy in  
 Liyanage v. Canada (M.C.I.) 
 , [2005] F.C.J. No. 1293(QL), 2005 FC 1045 at paragraph 41: 
 
 
 
 [...] the immigration officer could adopt the factual conclusions in her PRRA decision to the analysis she was making in the H&C application. However, it was important that she apply those facts to the test of unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship, a lower threshold than the test of risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment which was relevant to the PRRA decision.
