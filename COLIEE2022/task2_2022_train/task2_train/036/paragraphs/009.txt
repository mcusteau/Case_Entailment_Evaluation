  In my view, the family's net worth, even if the visa officer were correct in concluding that it was substantially less than that asserted by the parents, was not relevant to her assessment of the applicants' ability to meet the criteria of s. 15(1)(b) of the  
 Immigration Regulations 
 . The record clearly establishes that the applicants had the "sufficient financial resources" for the one-year period for which the student authorizations were sought. The visa officer's contrary conclusion constitutes a reviewable erroneous finding of fact in that it was made without regard to the material before her.
