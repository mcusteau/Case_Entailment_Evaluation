  In her affidavit filed in response to these applications for judicial review, the visa officer explained her determination that the applicants are not genuine visitors and her view that they were not seeking to enter Canada for a temporary purpose: 
 
 
 
 "First of all, despite their claims to considerable affluence, the applicant's parents' income tax returns disclosed that the applicant's parents had very low incomes, of less than $5,000 per year in Canadian funds. There was no other evidence which satisfied me that the Mittals were of greater means. I did not believe that persons of such apparently limited income would incur the expense of sending their children to Canada simply to attend elementary school. Secondly, the reason given for sending the applicant to Canada was stated to be the quality of education and the crowded classrooms in India. The applicant could, however, receive an excellent education at a private school in India, and avoid crowded classrooms, at considerably less expense and inconvenience." 
 
 
 
 The visa officer's two reasons concerning the parents' insufficient income and the availability of less expensive private schooling in India will be considered in turn.
