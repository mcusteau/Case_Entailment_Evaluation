The decision in Danielson was followed by Rouleau, J., in 1853-9049 Qu√©bec Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue (1986), 87 D.T.C. 5093; 9 F.T.R. 63 (F.C.T.D.). There the court, reviewing the Minister's directive under s. 225.2(1) as it then was, was not satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for believing the taxpayer would waste, liquidate or otherwise transfer its assets, or evade its fiscal obligations, or that on a balance of probabilities collection would be jeopardized by delay. Mere suspicion of collection being jeopardized by delay was not enough. In that case assets seized under the Minister's order exceeded the amount assessed for tax and, moreover, other substantial assets available to the taxpayer were not taken into account by department assessors at the time of the order. In the course of his judgment Rouleau, J., said at page 5099:
"Finally, it was established that the seizures in the case at bar have had the effect of paralyzing the applicant's activities and, indirectly, those of some of its subsidiaries. In short, the question is whether the respondent's debt is likely to be more jeopardized by the applicant's paralysis than by the passage of time allowed the taxpayer under s. 225.1 (1)..."
