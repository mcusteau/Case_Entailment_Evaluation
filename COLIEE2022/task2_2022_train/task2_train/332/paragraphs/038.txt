The third general factor relied on by officers of the department was the change in assets of the corporation. In financial statements filed with the company's 1986 tax return, assets of the company included an Ultimate 100 aircraft, a Lake Renegade aircraft and a 1986 Nissan van all purchased from company funds. Yet subsequently the ultimate aircraft was registered in the name of Brough, the Lake Renegade aircraft was said to have been purchased by Brough and registered in the United States in the name of Brough's mother who is resident in the United States, and the Nissan van was transferred to Manchee's name in March 1988, apparently as part of the settlement arrangements of personal relations and corporate involvement of Manchee. In addition the department pointed to a company bank account closed out, with the balance in the account apparently distributed in the spring of 1987, largely between Manchee and Brough. The evidence of the two principals is that the account in question was closed when the company ceased operations in Milton and another account, nearer Hillsburgh, was opened. In November 1988 the officers of the department apparently believed that the only asset of value of the company was the Lake Renegade aircraft which had originally been ordered seized under the writ of fieri facias in May. As noted earlier, another action contests the validity of the department's action, in part on the ground that at the time that aircraft was not owned by the company.
