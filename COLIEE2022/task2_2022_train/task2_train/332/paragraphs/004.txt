That general situation arose when on May 10, 1988, this court issued a writ of fieri facias on the application of Her Majesty the Queen, made, ex parte, upon filing on the same date of a certificate under s. 223 of the Income Tax Act. That section of the Act provides that a certificate when filed shall be deemed to be a judgment of the court against the debtor for a debt due to Her Majesty. Under the writ an aircraft, alleged by the Crown to be the property of the applicant corporation, Satellite, was seized by the Sheriff. In other proceedings David Brough has sought to contest the validity of the seizure and of the writ of fieri facias, inter alia, on the ground that the aircraft is not owned by the applicant corporation Satellite. In the original court file, no. ITA-1697-88, Mr. Justice Martin, on June 19, 1989, adjourned sine die the applicant's motion to strike the original writ of fieri facias pending the final disposition of the motion of December 22, 1988, the matter now under consideration. That course followed similar action by Mr. Justice Cullen, in court file no. T-2392-88, who ordered on January 9, 1989, that a motion by the applicant for an order quashing the writ of fieri facias be adjourned pending disposition of the motion of December 22, 1988.
