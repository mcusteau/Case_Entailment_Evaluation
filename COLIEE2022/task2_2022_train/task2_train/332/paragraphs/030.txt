In the summer of 1986 the Department of National Revenue, Taxation, initiated an audit of the company's operations and its tax liability. This led to correspondence, initiated by the department in November 1986, concerning operating expenses and research expenditures claimed on behalf of the company in the years 1984 and 1985. Brough replied to these letters on behalf of the corporation in December 1986, and the accountant retained by the company in previous years wrote to the department in February 1987. These replies were apparently not satisfactory explanations for the department which wrote again to the company for the attention of Brough in mid-April 1987. Brough replied two weeks later disputing some of the positions of the department auditor, indicating he would be writing to the Minister to complain of the department's methods and offering to meet department representatives to resolve concerns about research expenditures. Apparently there were discussions between tax auditors and the company's accountant early in 1987.
