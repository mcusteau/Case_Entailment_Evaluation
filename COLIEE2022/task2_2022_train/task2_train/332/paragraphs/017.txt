Occasionally there may be concern about whether the order should have been made initially, but I expect that this will not often be the principal focus, unless there appears to have been a serious procedural flaw in the original application. This was one ground for decision in Deputy Minister of National Revenue v. Vanwert and Wilma Atchison (1988), 89 D.T.C. 5088 (B.C.S.C.). That case was also based in part on another ground, that the Minister did not offer sufficient evidence to satisfy the test warranting an order under s. 225.2(2) of the Act.
