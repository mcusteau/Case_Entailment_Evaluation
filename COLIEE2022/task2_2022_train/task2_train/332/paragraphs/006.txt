While there are numerous initiatives in the name of the corporate party, Satellite Earth Station Technology Inc. and of its principal officer, Brough, the only matter fully dealt with in the hearing on June 26, as specified in the Notice of Return of Motion dated June 22, and the only issue dealt with in these reasons is whether the applicant corporation, Satellite, is entitled under s. 225.2 (8) of the Income Tax Act as amended, to have set aside the earlier order of this court made November 28, 1988. Determination of this issue simultaneously resolves the Crown's motion to dismiss the application of the corporation.
