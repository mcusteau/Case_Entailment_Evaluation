In an application to review a "jeopardy order" originally granted under s. 225.2(2) the issue will be whether that order will now be set aside or varied. In this, an application under s. 225.2(8) has the initial burden to muster evidence, whether by affidavits, by cross-examination of affiants on behalf of the Crown, or both, that there are reasonable grounds to doubt that the test required by s. 225.2(2) has been met. Thus the ultimate burden on the Crown established by s. 225.2(2) continues when an order granted by the court is reviewed under s. 225.2(8).
