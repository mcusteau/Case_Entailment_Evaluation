The second general conclusion from the applicant's evidence, that is, that a number of the concerns of the Department's officers can be reasonably answered, leads to a reasonable doubt about the likelihood of jeopardy, as a result of delay, in the collection process. This requires an assessment of whether all the evidence available at the date of hearing, June 26, 1989, on balance of probability leads to a conclusion that it is more likely than not that collection of part or all of the debt due Her Majesty would be jeopardized by delay. That is the standard required by s. 225.2(2) to support an order from the court authorizing collection action by the Minister, and that is the standard to be met upon review if the authorization once granted is to be sustained.
