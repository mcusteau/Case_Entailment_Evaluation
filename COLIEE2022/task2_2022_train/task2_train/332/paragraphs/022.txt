In Laframboise, supra, and in Berendt v. The Queen, an unreported decision of Eberle, J., in the Supreme Court of Ontario, both dealing with the predecessor of the current s. 225.2, the court, upon review, found that the evidence on a balance of probabilities supported the likelihood that collection would be in jeopardy by reason of delay, and thus that the jeopardy order of the Minister would not be varied. In each of these cases there appears to have been some evidence of the taxpayer's involvement in nefarious activities and also of the likelihood of dissipation of assets or their likely movement from the jurisdiction of the court. Where these factors were not present, in Danielson, supra, and in 1853-9049 Qu√©bec Inc., supra, both cases dealing with the predecessor of the current s. 225.2, and in Atchison, supra, dealing with s. 225.2 as it now is, the court was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the "jeopardy order", made by the Minister in the first two cases, and issued by the court in Atchison, should be set aside.
