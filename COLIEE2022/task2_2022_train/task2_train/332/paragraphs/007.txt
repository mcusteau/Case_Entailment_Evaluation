The applicant's original motion of December 22, 1988, also sought additional relief, namely, an order releasing seized aircraft N14008; an order to put the aircraft back in airworthy condition; an order restraining Revenue Canada from acting against the company or its owner, and restitution for damages. It did seem implicit from argument on behalf of the parties that if the order of November 28 were set aside the aircraft held under that authority would be released, but neither this nor other additional relief originally sought were argued and they are not dealt with in these reasons.
