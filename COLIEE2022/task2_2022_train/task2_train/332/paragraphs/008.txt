Under the Income Tax Act as amended ss. 222 to 228 set out a variety of procedures for collection of moneys owed to Her Majesty for taxes, interest, penalties or other charges under the Act. Among those procedures, s. 223, here followed by the Crown in May 1988, provides for a certificate of an amount owing to be registered with the court which registration effectively becomes a judgment of the court. Regular court processes, including in this case a writ of fieri facias, are then available to recover the debt due Her Majesty.
