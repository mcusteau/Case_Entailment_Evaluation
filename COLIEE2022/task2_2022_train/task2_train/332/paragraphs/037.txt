Second, reluctance on the part of Brough to file tax returns for 1987 and to provide documentation was set out by Sherman Lee as a basis for concluding there was risk warranting special action. The company's tax return for 1987 was due not later than November of that year. When it was not filed Brough had been requested by letters twice in June of 1988 to file the return, he was personally served in August with a notice to do so and in October was urged again to do so since the department was in a position to prosecute him for continuing failure. At the time of his affidavit of November 25, 1988, Lee indicates that the return for 1987 was still outstanding, Brough's affidavit swears that it was filed before November 25, 1988. On the other aspect of reluctance to provide information requested, Lee's affidavit points to the requests in November 1986 and April 1987 for information about expenditures for research and development. Yet it was the failure to provide such information that led in part to the reassessment of tax liability of the company, so that it is not as if the requests for information created any special barrier to departmental actions. In my view, the reluctance referred to in relation to information about research expenditures and in relation to the 1987 return, have no significance in considering the risk from delay in collection of arrears of taxes and interest claimed for the years 1984 to 1986.
