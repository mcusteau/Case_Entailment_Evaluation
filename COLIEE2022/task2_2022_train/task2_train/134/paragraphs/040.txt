  I am comforted in this conclusion by the decision reached by my colleague Justice Dawson in  
 Al Mansuri 
   
 v. 
   
 Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 
 , 2007 FC 22. The documents consulted by the PRRA officer in that case were bulletins providing guidance to caseworkers dealing with Libyan asylum claims and were therefore very similar to the document relied in the present case. After quoting from the decision of Justice DÃ©cary in  
 Mancia 
 , she characterized these documents as being in the public domain, available online, disseminated by a widely recognized and reliable source of information concerning country conditions, and general and neutral in their content (see para. 47). She then came to the following conclusion: 
 
 
 
 [52] [...] in light of the ongoing nature of the applicants' submissions with respect to risk, the public availability of the two documents at issue, the notoriety of the United Kingdom Home Office as a reliable source for country condition information, the general nature of the content of the two documents at issue, and the fact that Amnesty International documents on the same point were being submitted to the PRRA officer by the applicants the duty of fairness did not require disclosure of the two documents at issue. With due diligence the documents would have been available to the applicants. In view of that, and the content of the Amnesty International documents which the applicants did submit, the applicants were not deprived of a meaningful opportunity to fully and fairly present their case as to risk.
