 [3] 
  Exemptions under subsection 25(1) from the application of the requirements of the Act are discretionary and exceptional. In this case, the Applicant had a very heavy burden to meet in demonstrating that the Officer carried out an unreasonable assessment. The Officer considered the factors submitted to her by the Applicant, including the impact of the decision on the Applicant and her child and on the Applicant's co-tenant and the co-tenant's child, and found these insufficient to justify an exemption from the application of the Act. That decision was reasonable in the circumstances of this case.
