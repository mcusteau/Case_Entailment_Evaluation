 [55] 
  What really matters are not the words used by the Officer in assessing the best interests of the co-tenant's child, but whether the Officer was actually alert, alive and sensitive to that child's best interests:  
 Pannu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 1356, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1695 (QL), at para. 41. In this case the Officer did consider the impact on that child, but deemed it insufficient to warrant granting the Applicant's H&C application. Having found that the Officer did address the issue of the child's best interest, it is not for this Court to substitute its opinion for that of the Officer unless the Officer's decision was such as to fall outside the framework of reasonability. This is clearly not the case here. The child is not being separated from her mother, but from her mother's co-tenant. Moreover, the child will remain in Canada with both her biological parents. In such circumstances, the decision of the Officer falls within the realm of possible acceptable outcomes and is therefore reasonable.
