  The Applicant is a female citizen of Mexico born in January of 1987. She first came to Canada in 2005, when she was 18 years old, in order to study. She eventually claimed refugee status in July of 2007, but her claim was rejected in August 2008 by the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The Applicant then submitted, in November 2008, an application for permanent residence from within Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (the "H&C application").
