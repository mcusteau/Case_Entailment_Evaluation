  It is settled law that the best interests of children affected by humanitarian and compassionate applications are an important factor to be considered, but this factor is not determinative. As was noted by Justice DÃ©cary in  
 Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2002 FCA 125, [2002] 4 F.C. 358, 212 D.L.R. (4th) 139, [2002] F.C.J. No. 457 (QL), at para. 12: 
 
 
 
 In short, the immigration officer must be "alert, alive and sensitive" ( 
 Baker 
 , para. 75) to the interests of the children, but once she has well identified and defined this factor, it is up to her to determine what weight, in her view, it must be given in the circumstances. The presence of children, contrary to the conclusion of Justice Nadon, does not call for a certain result. It is not because the interests of the children favour the fact that a parent residing illegally in Canada should remain in Canada (which, as justly stated by Justice Nadon, will generally be the case), that the Minister must exercise his discretion in favour of said parent. Parliament has not decided, as of yet, that the presence of children in Canada constitutes in itself an impediment to any "refoulement" of a parent illegally residing in Canada (see  
 Langner v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1995), 184 N.R. 230 (F.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [1995] S.C.C.A. No. 241, SCC 24740, August 17, 1995).
