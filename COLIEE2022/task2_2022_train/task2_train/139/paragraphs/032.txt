  I agree with the Minister that a decision refusing to reopen an H&C application is a distinct decision from the actual decision on the H&C application decision, and may thus be challenged as a distinct decision in a judicial review proceeding. Here the Applicant only sought leave pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Act with respect to the May 11, 2009 decision, and leave was granted solely in regard to that decision. Consequently, I am not called upon to undertake any judicial review of the subsequent refusal to reopen the matter.
