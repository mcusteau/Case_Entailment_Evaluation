  The Applicant is correct in stating that in  
 Kurukkal v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2009 FC 695, [2009] F.C.J. No. 866 (QL), Justice Mactavish held that the doctrine of functus officio does not apply to the informal, non-adjudicative decision-making process involved in the determination of applications for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. In  
 Kurukkal 
  a question was certified on the issue of functus officio but it has yet to be addressed by the Federal Court of Appeal. Until and unless the Federal Court of Appeal makes a different determination on the matter, the law as stated by Justice Mactavish in  
 Kurrukkal 
  stands and, as a matter of judicial comity, I intend to follow her ruling.
