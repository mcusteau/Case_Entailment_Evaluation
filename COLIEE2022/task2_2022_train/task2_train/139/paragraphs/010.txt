 [10] 
  In her written submissions, the Applicant raises two principal issues: 
 
 
 
 (a) Did the Officer err in her assessment of the evidence, and particularly, did she fail to be alert, alive and sensitive to the best interests of the children who would be affected by the decision? 
 
 
 
 (b) Did the Officer breach procedural fairness in denying the Applicant an opportunity to respond after the officer (allegedly) changed her mind regarding the outcome of the application?
