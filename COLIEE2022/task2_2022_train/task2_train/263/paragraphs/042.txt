It was not disputed that an applicant for the registration of a trademark has the burden of proving that there will be no reasonable likelihood of confusion with an existing mark, and that the burden remains on the applicant both before the Registrar and on an appeal to the court:
McDonald's Corp. et al. v. Coffee Hut Stores Ltd.
(1994), 76 F.T.R. 281; 55 C.P.R.(3d) 463 (T.D.). In other words, any doubt is to be resolved in favour of the opponent, in this case, Garbo Group.
