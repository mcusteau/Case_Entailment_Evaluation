Gary Grundman is the president of Garbo Group Inc. In the affidavit that he swore in November 1997 for the purpose of this appeal Mr. Grundman stated that in the previous four years the company's total sales of goods covered by the "Garbo" marks exceeded $10 million. The best year was 1994 when sales were just under $4 million; thereafter they dropped sharply, but in 1997 recovered to something in excess of $2 million.
