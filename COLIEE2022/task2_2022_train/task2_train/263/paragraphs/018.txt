First, the language of the constitutive legislation must be examined. Here, it is relevant to note that s. 56(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
creates a right of appeal from the Registrar to the court, and imposes no limitation on its scope. Indeed, s. 56(5) expressly permits the parties to adduce additional evidence on an appeal that was not before the administrative decision-maker, and authorises the court to exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar. However, since the likelihood of confusion is a question of fact or mixed fact and law, not discretion, this latter provision is irrelevant to this appeal.
