In 1992 Harriet Brown & Company Inc. applied to register the trademark "Greta Garbo" which it proposed to use in Canada in association with cosmetics and toiletries, and eyeglasses and accessories, including sunglasses. Garbo Group opposed this registration on the ground that there was a reasonable likelihood of confusion between the proposed "Greta Garbo" mark and the "Garbo" marks and trade names.
