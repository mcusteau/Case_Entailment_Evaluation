Mr. Grundman has further stated that the word "Garbo" is a coined word from the letters that start the given names of the principals of the company,
Gar
y and
Bo
nnie Grundman. Whether the word was also intended to suggest to consumers the late Greta Garbo, legendary movie actress of the 1930s and the early 1940s, and thereafter famous and mysterious recluse, is not of immediate relevance here. However, as counsel suggested in argument, the Grundmans' choice of "Garbo" as the trademark for their fashion accessories, rather than some other combination of the initial letters in their names, such as BONGA, may not have been entirely arbitrary.
