The second point to be made here is that, as s. 6 of the
Act
provides, the relevant question is not whether there is a reasonable likelihood of confusion in the abstract between the proposed mark and any existing mark. Rather, it is whether the applicant's proposed mark is reasonably likely to induce consumers into thinking that the goods to which the mark will be attached emanate from the same source as, or are otherwise associated with, the goods covered by the opponent's mark.
