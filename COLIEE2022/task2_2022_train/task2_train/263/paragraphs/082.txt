Ms. Barham is an expert in the fashion industry. She is the editor of a national fashion magazine, and is a member of an organization called The Fashion Group International, a global, non-profit, professional organization with over 6,000 members. In paragraph 5 of her affidavit, Ms. Barham stated that in the course of her career she has acquired "expertise in all aspects of the fashion industry, including jewellery, toiletries and eyeglasses". The products of this industry, whether it is characterized as the fashion industry or the fashion accessory industry, would seem to me to fall into the same "general category of goods."
