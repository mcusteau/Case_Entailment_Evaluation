Hughes on Trade Marks
, looseleaf (Toronto; Butterworths; 1984) says (at page 629) the following about the inquiry to be made when determining whether the nature of the trade in different products is likely to cause confusion:
"The risk of confusion is greater where the wares or services, though dissimilar, are distributed in the same types of stores or are of the same general category of goods; for example, if both items are in the general category of household products and are sold in similar places, then confusion is more likely. However, where one mark refers to household products and the other to automotive products and they are distributed in different types of shops, there is less likelihood that consumers will mistake one mark for the other."
