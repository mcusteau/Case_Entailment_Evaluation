  It is difficult to know exactly what the facts are in this matter. The IAD described the evidence given by the applicant this way: 
 
 
 
 I find the fact that the applicant has changed her story every time she has been in front of an Immigration official or a panel, indicative of a person who is hiding evidence and I am not prepared to accept her new story as testified to during the course of this hearing as true. In my view, the appellant continues to lie and misrepresent facts to suit her own purposes and as such, I do not believe her version of events.
