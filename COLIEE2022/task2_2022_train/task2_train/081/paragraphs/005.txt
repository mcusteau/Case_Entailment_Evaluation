  By letter dated July 31, 2005, Mr. Qureshi wrote to Immigration Canada stating that their marriage was a fraud: 
 
 
 
 Mrs. Uzma Luqman Qureshi came to Canada under false pretenses. She did not consummate the marriage. My uncle, M. Younas Qureshi, has kept her in his custody since she arrived in Canada on, September 17/ 2004 till now. All my sponsorship documents are with my uncle, M. Younas Qureshi ... [S] he refuses to see me or even take my phone calls. I was basically just her ticket to come to Canada and now that she's here, she plans to marry my uncle's nephew, Sohail Qureshi, who currently resides in Pakistan.
