  On May 1, 2007, the reviewing officer referred a report pursuant to section 44 of the  
 Act 
  to the ID for an admissibility hearing. At the ID hearing, the applicant's uncle testified that his niece had never lived with him. This is also an admitted lie. On January 21, 2009, the ID found the applicant to be a person described in paragraph 40(1)(a) of the  
 Act 
  and an Exclusion Order was issued. This was appealed to the IAD which dismissed the appeal on June 28, 2011. That is the decision under review.
