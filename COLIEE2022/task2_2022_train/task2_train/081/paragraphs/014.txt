  The applicant cites  
 Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) (FC) 
 , 2007 FC 725, at para 43 [ 
 Hernandez 
 ], and argues that the IAD's decision should be set aside because she should have received a copy of the letter considered in the subsection 44(1) determination. Had she been given access to the details of the complaint against her, she could have brought to the officer's attention the fact that her ex-husband had gone to Pakistan, married another cousin and had also abandoned her.
