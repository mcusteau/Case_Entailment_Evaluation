Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is an application by the plaintiff for an order allowing it to retain possession of three Zodiac inflatable boats owned by the defendants, in order to set off the value of the boats against the amount being claimed by the plaintiff in its action against the defendants in this court (action number T-1571-93). In addition, the plaintiff seeks an order freezing all the defendants' bank accounts, goods and chattels effective immediately in order to secure the payment of any award which may be rendered against the defendant Mr. Blyth and his related companies in favour of Marine Atlantic Inc. In the alternative, the plaintiff seeks an order requiring Mr. Blyth personally and the other defendants to post security in the court for $1 million in order to secure payment of the plaintiff's claim for damages.
