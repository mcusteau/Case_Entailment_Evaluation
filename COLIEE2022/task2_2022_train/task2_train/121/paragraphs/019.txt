  Did the Officer fail to have regard to certain of the evidence - specifically that the Applicant and Ms Nawabi were engaged five months prior to his being questioned by the Inland Enforcement Officer? I do not think so. In the reasons, the Officer notes that she reviewed photos from their engagement. A review of the FOSS notes contained in the Certified Tribunal Record also shows that the Officer considered the photos from the engagement. However, offsetting the engagement photos was the fact that the Applicant could only produce photos from three occasions, even though he claims to have been in a relationship for three years.
