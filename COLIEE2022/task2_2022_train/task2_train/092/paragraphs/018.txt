 [18] 
  With respect to the applicant's argument that the Board failed to deal with certain other evidence she adduced, I accept the respondent's submission that the Board is not required to mention all of the evidence introduced by the applicant: Hassan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 147 N.R. 317 (C.A.). However, I am of the view that the Board should have specifically dealt with the letter from the applicant's Mother, tendered to corroborate the applicant's evidence that the threats from the ZANU-PF are ongoing. Notwithstanding this error, the decision must be considered as a whole, in the sense that a reviewing court should not seize on one or more mistakes or elements of the decision which do not affect the decision as a whole. The Supreme Court of Canada in a recent decision stated that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling. The Court went on to state that this does not mean that every element of the reasoning given must independently pass a test for reasonableness. The question is rather whether the reasons, taken as a whole, are tenable as support for the decision. See Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan [2003] S.C.J. No. 17 at para. 55 & 56. I am satisfied that the reasons in this instance are tenable as support for the decision. 
 
 
 
 B. Did the Board commit an error of law in concluding that the applicant is not a person in need of protection?
