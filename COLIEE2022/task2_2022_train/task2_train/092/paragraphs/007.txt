  The Board stated that it did not believe that the applicant would be harmed were she to return to Zimbabwe. Although the applicant stated that the ZANU-PF generally carry out their threats, the Board asked why the applicant would be followed 300 miles to her parents' home, and then not be harmed after having received threats at that location. The Board held that "there was no credible evidence before [it] to indicate that members of ZANU-PF had any interest in the claimant before she came to Canada or that they will if she were to return to Zimbabwe today." Consequently, the Board rejected the applicant's claim for asylum.
