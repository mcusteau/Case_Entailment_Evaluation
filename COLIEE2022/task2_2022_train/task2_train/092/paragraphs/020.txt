  The applicant's argument on this second issue relies in part on grounds stated in her first issue: that the Board failed to have regard to the documentary evidence in assessing her claim. For essentially the same reasons given earlier, I find the Board's determination that the applicant's story was implausible in the circumstances to be reasonably open to it. Consequently, the applicant's argument concerning the documentary evidence is without merit.
