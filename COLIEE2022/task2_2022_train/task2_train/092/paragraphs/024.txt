  This error is not, in my view, material to the result. The Board did in its reasons consider the documentary evidence and I find that, in the circumstances of this case, the evidence would not support a finding that the applicant was a person in need of protection within the provisions of s. 97 of the Act, in any event. No useful purpose would be served in sending the matter back for re-consideration on this basis.
