  The election in which the applicant participated in as an election monitor was a civic election in Harare, held on September 8-9, 2001. The documentation on the record deals with the national elections that were held on June 24-25, 2000, and in 2002, and refer essentially to polling agents who worked for an opposition party candidate and to "middle-ranking opposition officials" targeted by the ZANU-PF. The applicant's situation is different, since she was a one-time election monitor whose political party affiliation was not known prior to her being hired. The Board noted in its reasons that the applicant joined the MDC in February 2001, and participated in three rallies that year. There is no evidence of her being politically involved prior to that time.
