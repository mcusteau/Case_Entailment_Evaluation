In oral and written submissions counsel for the applicant stated that the appropriate measure of damages in these cases was assessed according to the notice period required to be given by an employer under the common law. However, research indicated that limiting an award on the basis of the common law or s. 235 of the
Code
was an error. I revealed the fruits of this research to counsel for the applicant in a memorandum and asked for his written submissions. When I received these submissions from counsel it appeared that he felt aggrieved by not being heard orally and I therefore instructed an oral hearing to be held with respect to the issue of the quantum of damages awarded by the adjudicator by way of teleconference. Counsel for both parties participated in this hearing.
