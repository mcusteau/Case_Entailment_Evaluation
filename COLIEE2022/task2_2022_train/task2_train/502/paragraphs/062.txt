With respect to "personal expenses" awarded to Ms. Young, the applicant asserts that these amounts were not proven by the respondent. However, the adjudicator wrote at p. 28:
"These expenses totalling $485.84 have been established. They cover costs directly incurred in the preparation of her complaint and I see no reason not to award it pursuant to s. 242(4)(c)."
I have no reason, on the evidence, to doubt that these sums and the basis for their disbursement were established. Counsel for the applicant alleged that the sums were not proven but did not reveal to the court on what basis the adjudicator reached the decision that they had been "established". There are handwritten lists of expenses in the evidence but there is no transcript of the proceedings. As there is nothing in the record which discloses that this decision was reached in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the evidence, I am unable to interfere with it.
