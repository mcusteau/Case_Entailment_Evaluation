Although an adjudicator retains jurisdiction to finally dispose of a matter by rendering an order pursuant to s. 242(4), the adjudicator is not thereby empowered to rehear the merits of a case. The applicant did not seriously contest that the actual merits of the claim were finally disposed of, aside from the question of bias. Clearly, the adjudicator had decided the issue and absent any specific legislative provision, was "functus officio".
