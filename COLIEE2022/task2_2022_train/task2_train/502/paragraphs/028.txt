Sections 16(a), (b) and (c), generally speaking, give the Board the power to summon and enforce attendance of witnesses and the production of documents, to administer oaths and to receive evidence. It is noteworthy that s. 242(2)(c) does not give to the adjudicator the powers conferred on the Board by ss. 16(d) through (p). This is not a situation where giving affect to the powers accorded by ss. 16(a) to (c) requires the application of the powers found in s. 18. Parliament clearly accorded the adjudicator the powers found in the first three subsections of s. 16 and no others.
