A quick perusal of the
Code
is sufficient to determine that an adjudicator and the Board are two distinct entities with very different functions. Although s. 18 of Part I gives power to the Board, the section does not confer any power whatsoever on an adjudicator appointed under circumstances anticipated by Part III of the
Code
. In
Norwy House Indian Band v. Bass and Duncan et al.
, [1994] 3 F.C. 376; 75 F.T.R. 246, Muldoon, J., stated at p. 422:
"The emphasis of Parliament's privative clause, which, the Supreme Court ordains, may be overridden in instances of 'patent unreasonability' may be appreciated by contrast with s. 18, in Division II-Canada Labour Relations Board, Part I of the
Code
. It, by extreme contrast with any provision of Division XIV, Part III, empowers the
Board
, thus: (s. 18 is reproduced)
"That is a far cry from any of the provisions of Division XIV, Part III."
