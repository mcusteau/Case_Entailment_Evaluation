In the first paragraph quoted above, a general reference is made to the amount of the offer without disclosing that amount. This does not put "evidence" before the adjudicator in any sense which might be construed as tainting the proceedings. Obviously the amount of the offer is unacceptable to the employee. The fact that the two sides cannot agree on an appropriate quantum is the reason for having to hold a second hearing.
