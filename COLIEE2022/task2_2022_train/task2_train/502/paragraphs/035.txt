In the supplementary decision the adjudicator wrote at p. 18:
"I have closely reviewed the incidents alleged by counsel to constitute apprehension of bias in the instant case. I fail to see how a reasonable person could consider the fact of allowing one party to introduce evidence that counsel may a year later with hindsight see as counterproductive to his case as a sign of bias. The role of the adjudicator in the conduct of a hearing is to act more or less 'in the role of a judge and not venture into the fray as prosecutor or defence' (
Canadian Labour Law
(2nd Ed.), G.W. Adams, Canada Law Book, par 4.730). This is precisely what happened here, and failing compelling evidence showing that a party was not aware of its acts, I fail to see how it could be otherwise."
I agree with his assessment of this situation. The mere fact that the evidence was unfavourable to the employer's case does not mean that it created a reasonable apprehension of bias. For all of these reasons the interim award of adjudicator Brault will not be set aside.
