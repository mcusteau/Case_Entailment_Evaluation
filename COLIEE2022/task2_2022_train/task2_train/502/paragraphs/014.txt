As I read the decision of Mr. Brault it is clear that he was not persuaded by the evidence adduced by the Wolf Lake Band that they had dismissed Ms. Young due to financial difficulties. Although Mr. Brault canvassed other possible reasons, he made no definitive finding as to what motivated the Band Council to dismiss Ms. Young. What is clear from the decision however, is that Ms. Young was let go for some reason other than financial difficulties and that the Band was not able to demonstrate that they had a just or bona fide reason for dismissing her.
