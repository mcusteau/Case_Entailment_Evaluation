I read this to mean that interest on the wages owed will run as of the date they became due according to the principles set out in
Banca
, supra at p. 75:
"On the other hand, I consider that the adjudicator did exceed his authority in awarding interest on the basis of the lump sum compensation allowed, rather than on the basis of a series of payments which the respondent would have been paid had he remained in employment. As I see it, if the award were allowed to stand, the respondent would receive something more than that which is 'equitable', and that would do more then 'remedy or counteract' a consequence of his unjust dismissal. The respondent would be enriched beyond that permitted by the statute. The decision should be set aside on this basis as well."
