Although this point was not raised by the respondent in these proceedings, it is my opinion that the application for judicial review of the interim award is out of time. This finding is the result of a determination that, once the decision on the merits of the issue had been issued, the adjudicator was "functus officio" [see footnote 1] with respect to that issue. Therefore, the decision rendered on February 14, 1995, is a final determination of the merits of Ms. Young's complaint and time began to run from that date. However, even if that were not so, I would not interfere with the findings of the adjudicator, Mr. Brault. There is ample evidence in the record to support his conclusions and I can find no error of fact or of law which would allow me to intervene.
