An adjudicator appointed pursuant to s. 242 of the
Code
is not an employee of Labour Canada. The adjudicator is appointed by the Minister on receipt of a report from an inspector indicating that attempts at settling the dispute between the parties via the inspector have failed. In
Norway House
, supra, Muldoon, J., described the role of the adjudicator in the following terms at p. 422:
"Here the Adjudicator is not a full-time, career, institutional board, commission or other tribunal, but an individual selected ad hoc and uniquely in order to perform a single, one-time adjudication, without any institutional expertise or collegiality."
