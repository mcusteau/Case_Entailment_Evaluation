Further support for the position that Part III of the
Code
provides everything which is necessary to dispose of a case of unjust dismissal is found in
Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro of Canada Ltd. v. Lee-Shanok
(1988), 87 N.R. 178; 22 C.C.E.L. 59 (F.C.A.), where Stone, J.A., wrote at p. 78:
"Part III of the
