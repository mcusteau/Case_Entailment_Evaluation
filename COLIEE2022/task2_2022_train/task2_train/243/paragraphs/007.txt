In any event, it appears to me that the policy required five years "underground". The purpose of the policy is to give special consideration to people illegally in the country for that period of time. Nothing in the material filed indicates to me that it was intended to come to the assistance of people who were either arrested, apprehended or discovered by immigration officers. Indeed, subsequent clarification of the policy specifically excluded those who did not come forward voluntarily, but who did so only as a reult of apprehension.
