In respect to the disputed fact, I see no reason to disbelieve the sworn affidavit of the respondent's officers which simply confirms that they did nothing more nor less than is their practice in every case of this sort. The applicant's version, on the other hand, is astonishing to say the least. If it is to be credible, I must believe: that the stewardess who had signed for his passport allowed him to walk into the waiting room without any precautionary measures; that in the same waiting room there were no Air Canada people attending to the last minute passengers who took notice of his presence or said anything to him before closing the gate and leaving him stranded there; and that on arrival at their destination, the stewardess who had signed for the passport would make no report to the captain or anyone in authority about the fact that she still had the passport, but no passenger. To the extent that the respondent's determination is based upon the failure to believe the applicant's story, I do not find that such an interpretation constitutes unfair treatment in any sence of the word.
