(1999), 164 F.T.R. 177 (T.D.), that the standard of review for decisions of Citizenship Judges "is close to the correctness end of the spectrum", I would emphasize that since the Supreme Court's decision in
Dr. Q., Re
(2003), 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170; 223 D.L.R.(4th) 599 (S.C.C.), at page 613 [D.L.R.], there are only three standards of review that courts can choose from:

Where little or no deference is called for, a correctness standard will suffice. If the balancing of factors suggests a standard of deference somewhere in the middle, the reasonableness simpliciter standard will apply."
