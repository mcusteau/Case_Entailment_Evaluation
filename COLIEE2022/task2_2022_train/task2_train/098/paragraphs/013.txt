  It appears to me that the Director must take account of all of the relevant circumstances, including FH's trademarks and its exclusive rights to use those marks in association with its business (according to s. 19 of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 ). In addition, the Director may consider all of the other factors and potential consequences about which FH is concerned, as well as the corporate history and operations of both parties. I cannot conclude from the Director's decision not to stay FRP's application that the result is a foregone conclusion to FH's detriment. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that there exist special circumstances that would justify the Court's reviewing the Director's interlocutory decision. I agree with the approach taken by Justice Walsh in similar circumstances:  
 Brick Warehouse Corp. v. Brick's Fine Furniture Ltd. et al. 
 , [1992] F.C.J. No. 272; 53 F.T.R. 133, (T.D.).
