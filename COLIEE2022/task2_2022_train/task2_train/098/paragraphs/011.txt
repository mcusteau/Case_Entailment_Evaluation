  FH argues that special circumstances exist in this case that merit the Court's early intervention. In particular, FH argues that the Director's decision not to grant a stay has the following implications: 
 
 
 
 - The Director's decision to deal with FRP's application while the trademark proceedings are ongoing indicates that the Director plans to arrive at a decision without taking account of FH's ownership of the "Fairmont" trademarks. 
 
 
 
 - In the absence of consideration of FH's trademarks, the only other factor that the Director could evaluate would be the respective dates of incorporation of the parties. FRP was incorporated before the applicants, so the Director will undoubtedly allow FRP's application. 
 
 
 
 - In any case, the issue of confusion cannot be resolved within FRP's application because the alleged confusion arises primarily from use of the word "Fairmont" for which FH has a registered trademark. FH's entitlement to use that mark can only be resolved in the trademark proceedings, not in FRP's application under the  
 CBCA 
 . Therefore, the Director is simply not in a position to decide FRP's application. 
 
 
 
 - If the Director grants FRP's application, FH will be in the strange position of having to remove the word "Fairmont" from its corporate name while still being entitled to use the "Fairmont" trademark. This will cause FH irreparable harm and actually cause greater confusion among members of the public.
