  The parties are completely separate entities, with different histories operating in different spheres (the applicants own and manage a chain of hotels, while the respondent runs a time-share business). Yet, they have common ties to Fairmont Hot Springs, British Columbia, specifically to the Fairmont Hot Springs Resort (FHSR). In addition to its trademarks for "Fairmont", FH acquired FHSR's trademarks in 2000 and then licensed them back to FHSR. FRP used to operate FHSR's time share operations, but is no longer affiliated with it. However, FRP obtained FHSR's permission to use the word "Fairmont" in its corporate name in 1985.
