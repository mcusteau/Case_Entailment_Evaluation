  On the other hand, courts have also recognized that there are special circumstances where early intervention by an appellate or reviewing court is appropriate. It would be unfair, for example, to refuse to intervene when the underlying decision denies a party the benefit of a fair hearing, discloses grounds for an apprehension of bias, or curtails a party's substantive rights:  
 Canadian Human Rights Commission v. Canada 3000 Airlines Ltd. et al. 
 , [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 271, [1999] F.C.J. No. 725 (T.D.), at para. 15;  
 Zundel 
 , above, at para. 15. Similarly, where the tribunal wrongly exceeded or circumscribed its jurisdiction, or declined to exercise it, early judicial intervention may be appropriate although, even in this area, courts should be cautious:
