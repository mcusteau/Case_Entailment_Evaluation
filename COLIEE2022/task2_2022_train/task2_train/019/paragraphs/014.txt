  For these reasons, and perhaps others, the Court has, in the context of public law applications, required that the parties provide a cogent reason, other than their consent, for setting aside a decision of a tribunal. As Mr. Justice Muldoon noted in  
 Ladio v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 413; [1997] F.C.J. No. 991 at paragraphs 3 and 4, this brings transparency to the process by providing an assurance that, for example, the Crown's consent is not motivated by any favouritism, and by fixing the Crown with a publicly expressed reason for its decision to consent to a particular judgment.
