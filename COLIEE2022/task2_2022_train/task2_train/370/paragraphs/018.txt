In my view this jurisprudence is sound. The objection that the facts in issue which form the subject of the interrogatories are beyond living memory seems, with respect, to be specious. Especially where matters of aboriginal rights are concerned, tradition custom and oral history may be valid sources of historical fact. The deponent on discovery is not a simple witness but is the representative of and speaks for a party qua party. Furthermore, institutions may also have memories and the Crown is quintessentially one such institution. To say that the Crown can have no factual information about anything which goes beyond living memory (as a practical matter, some time after the first world war) seems to me to be absurd. Governments, more than most institutions, are notorious for keeping records of what they do and such records may be constantly referred to and relied upon as a source of current practice even today. While most such records will be in documentary form it is by no means inconceivable that institutional memory may manifest itself in other forms such as practices and traditions. If these are the source of factual allegations by or against the Crown, they may surely be made the proper object of discovery.
