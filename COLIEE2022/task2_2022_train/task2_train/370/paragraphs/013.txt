I turn now to the specific objections raised by the Crown to the interrogatories in these cases. They are, as I have said, nine in number as follows:
1. Historical questions beyond the memory of any living person;
2. Questions relating to the interpretation of documents;
3. Questions requiring the expression of an opinion;
4. Questions requiring the deponent to state the Crown's legal position or apply principles of law;
5. Questions which ask for arguments or evidence;
6. Questions which are unreasonable or unnecessary;
7. Questions which are irrelevant or overly broad;
8. Questions which are vague and ambiguous;
9. Questions which ask for privileged information.
As indicated earlier, many of these grounds of objection overlap in the sense that more than one of them may be invoked in support of an objection to any particular question. Many others, notably numbers 6 to 9 above, do not raise any issue of principle but simply require the application of well known rules of law to particular questions. However, items 1-3 (which are virtually always invoked simultaneously) and 4 and 5 (which are frequently pleaded as additional grounds) raise some important issues which go to the very heart of the nature of discovery in actions of this sort and require more detailed analysis. I turn to them first.
