I also find unconvincing the objection that a deponent to historical facts is being asked to interpret documents or to give an opinion. The rule against requiring a deponent to interpret documents is most properly applied where the document in question is a contract and the witness is asked what he or she thinks it means. Documents, however, can and do serve as the basis of a great deal of factual information and a deponent who is asked to give such information is not being asked to interpret the document or to give an opinion but rather to state on behalf of the party he or she represents, that party's understanding of the facts represented therein. Even in a wholly modern context, records are often expressed in some form of code, overt or covert; a corporate party, or even an individual, may surely be asked to give the true meaning of such records.
