The Crown has been unsuccessful on virtually all of its submissions. On those very few questions where the Crown has had success on this motion, the matter has been one which in my view could have been settled by a simple discussion between counsel or, at worst, on a short motion heard by telephone conference. As it is the hearing of this motion has taken more than two days of court time in both Ottawa and Calgary together with a number of telephone conferences; all parties have also produced voluminous written submissions and supporting materials. It is my view that this motion ought not to have been brought or, if brought, ought to have been of very much less duration and complexity. No attempt has been made by the Crown to facilitate written discovery even though it was agreed upon. Many of the objections verge on the frivolous; it was for example argued, apparently seriously, that a question as to how many members had "left" a reserve by a certain date required the Crown to indicate which members had gone on hunting trips off the reserve during the period. Such submissions are scarcely evidence of an honest effort to understand the interrogatories and to answer them in good faith. Indeed, if the Crown had not enjoyed some very minor measure of success on the motion, I would not have hesitated to impose costs on a solicitor and client basis. As it is, the Crown will pay the costs of each plaintiff Band forthwith and in any event of the cause, such costs being fixed in the amount of $5,000 for each Band.
Order accordingly.
