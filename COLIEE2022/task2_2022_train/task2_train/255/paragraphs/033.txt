I am unable to tell from the material before me whether the application which led to the decision of July 17, 1997 was made after June 15, 1995 but assuming it was, the Minister has a discretion to address all issues arising out of the application if he is moved to do so. That, of course, is a matter for the Minister. All this court can say is that this appears to it to be a case in which the exerÂ­cise of the Minister's discretion to review the issue of Mr. King's entitlement would be in the interests of justice.
