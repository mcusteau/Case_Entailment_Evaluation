The french version of the section says that the Table is provided to help ("aider") physicians and surgeons who conduct medi­cal examination "pour déterminer des pen­sions". "Déterminer" is defined in
Le Nou­veau Petit Robert
, Dictionnaires Petit Robert, Paris, 1993 as follows: "Indiquer, délimiter avec précision, au terme d'une réflexion, d'une recherche" which I translate as "to define with precision following an inquiry".
Harrap's French English Dic­tionary
, Harrap, Edinburgh, 1994 translates "déterminer" as "to determine (species, value, noun, area, etc)". This does not support the view that physicians and surgeons are mere cataloguers of indicia of disability for the Board. It is not necessary for me to decide the respective roles the Board and physicians and surgeons in the pension scheme for purposes of this application but I do not accept the Board's narrow definition of the role of physicians and surgeons in the as­sessment process. It is sufficient for these purposes to say that having regard to the expertise of physicians and surgeons in assessing disability, and the legislative provi­sions which suggest that physicians have a role to play in assessing the degree of dis­ability, the Board cannot reject a physician's assessment of disability without providing meaningful reasons as to why it is doing so.
