Mr. King seeks to have the Board's decision set aside on four grounds:
- The Board did not draw all inferences favourable to Mr. King nor did it give him the benefit of the doubt with respect to the evidence, contrary to ss. 39 and 3 of the
Veteran's Review and Appeal Board Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. V-1.6.
- The Board failed to give effect to un­contradicted medical evidence.
- The Board failed to give adequate rea­sons for its decision.
- The Board arrived at a decision which is not supported by any evidence.
