It is true that s. 18 of the
Act
gives the Board jurisdiction with respect to reviews of pension decisions and s. 26 gives the Board jurisdiction with respect to appeals. It is also true that the Board cannot have been inÂ­tended to simply rubber stamp any medical opinion put before it. But s. 35(2) is clear that the Table of Disabilities is provided for the guidance of physicians and surgeons, no doubt to promote a uniform standard for assessment. If physicians and surgeons are limited to listing symptoms and signs which the Board will then classify according to the Table, it cannot be said that the Table is for their guidance. In such a case, the Table would be for the Board's guidance.
