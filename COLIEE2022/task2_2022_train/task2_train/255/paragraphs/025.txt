Mackay, J., held that the process which lead to the reduction of Mr. King's pension was "extraordinary".
"It seems bizarre that a pension being paid at a rate established by earlier appeals to the VAB, and in relation to entitled con­ditions, can be reduced very significantly after consideration of reports of medical specialists, including a number to whom the Commission referred the applicant, where the examining doctors recommend increases in pension. If the doctors' reports were not related to matters of concern to the Commission surely that was a matter to be straightened out by the Commission, which arranged for their assessments, before the Commission ignored them. If, as counsel for the respondent suggested, the comments of doctors related to conditions other than those for which entitlement had been accorded but which those doctors clearly related to his original injury, then the appeal by the applicant in regard to reduction of his assessments ought not to have precluded the Commission from simultaneously commencing review of Mr. King's entitlement. Particularly is this so if, as counsel for the respondent suggested, there appeared no dispute that the ap­plicant's overall condition, probably trace­able to his original injury, warranted sig­nificant pension support based on en­titlement related to conditions not yet considered."
