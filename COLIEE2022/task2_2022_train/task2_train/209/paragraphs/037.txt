 [37] 
  The requirement that an applicant point out or bring forth the substance of the omission, is similar to the requirement in other cases where a breach of procedural fairness is claimed, that the applicant show some prejudice as a result of the breach (see  
 Naiki 
  above, at paragraph 43).
