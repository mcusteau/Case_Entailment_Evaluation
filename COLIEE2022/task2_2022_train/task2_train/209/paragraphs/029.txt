  This brings us to the applicant's allegations of procedural unfairness, because after all, he does not challenge the procedures of the Commission per se, but the investigation report which the Commission adopted. As noted in those situations, the duty of fairness only requires that the investigation and report be neutral and thorough and does not require any quasi-judicial procedures. Thus, the applicant's specific allegations regarding the content of the duty of fairness (i.e. the lack of a personal interview by the investigator and the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses) will only be a breach of procedural fairness if shown that those omissions resulted in a lack of neutrality or thoroughness.
