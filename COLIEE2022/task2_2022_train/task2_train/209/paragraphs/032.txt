  The requirement of thoroughness stems from the essential role that investigators play in determining the merits of each complaint (see  
 Slattery 
  above, at paragraph 53,  
 SEPQA 
  above, at page 898). However, the desire for thoroughness must be balanced against the Commission's limited resources and its need to allocate them between competing needs. Thus, judicial review for a lack of thoroughness in the investigation is only warranted where an investigator misses obviously crucial evidence and when such an omission cannot be addressed adequately with subsequent submissions directly to the Commission (see  
 Slattery 
  above, at paragraph 56).
