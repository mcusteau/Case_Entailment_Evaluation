  In August of 2008, the Commission provided Canada Post and the applicant with its investigation report. The investigation report recommended that the Commission dismiss the complaint because the evidence gathered did not support the applicant's allegations of discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin nor did it support that Canada Post engaged in a discriminatory policy or practice on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin.
