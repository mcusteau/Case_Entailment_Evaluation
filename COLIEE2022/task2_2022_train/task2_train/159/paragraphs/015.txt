  It seems plain to me that Rule 494(1) contemplates the ability of a Plaintiff to request, and upon request in accordance with the Rules, be issued a warrant of arrest notwithstanding the existence of a caveat warrant. I find no merit to the Defendant's suggestion that a warrant issued in the face of a caveat warrant is invalid or capable of being struck for that sole reason. By setting out the consequences to the Plaintiff of requesting a warrant in the face of a caveat warrant, Rule 494 necessarily confirms the ability of a Plaintiff to do so.
