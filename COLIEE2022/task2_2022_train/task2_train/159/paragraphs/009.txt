  The third, subsidiary argument of the Defendant is by far the most serious. The Plaintiff sent to the Defendant on June 15, 2005 an electronic document stated to be an up-to-date "A/R [accounts receivable] customer transaction listing" for all of its accounts, indicating a total of $136,132.25 for outstanding invoices plus interest charges of $172,884.09, for a total amount overdue of $309,016.34. It is common ground between the parties that following that updated statement, on June 17, 2005, the Defendant remitted the sum of $31,479.00 to the Plaintiff, and that no new charges for goods or services were incurred by the Defendant and no new invoices were issued by the Plaintiff. Yet, when the Plaintiff issued its statement of claim on August 26, 2005, it claimed the amount of $740,359.90, being over twice the amounts claimed by the Plaintiff to have been owed as of two months earlier; that increase cannot be accounted for by mere accrual of interest over a period of two months.
