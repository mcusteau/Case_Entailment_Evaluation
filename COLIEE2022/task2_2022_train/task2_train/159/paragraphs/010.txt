  This glaring discrepancy required a response and explanation from the Plaintiff. The explanation, such as it is, it to be found in paragraphs 35 and 36 of the affidavit in reply of Sotirios Moutsios and is twofold: That "the payment so far received by the Defendant had not been applied against interest first as provided for in the governing terms and conditions" and that "due to a problem with the programming of our system the calculation of interest was suspended for a duration corresponding to the payment terms of our invoices every time it was posted in our system (which should not have been)". The Defendant did not cross-examine Mr. Moutsios very closely on that explanation. As a result, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the two "errors" that resulted in the accounts receivable transaction listing of June 15, 2005 are limited to that specific report or are "errors" that have been repeated throughout the business relationship between the parties. It is far from obvious that a single instance of incorrect calculation or error cannot validly be corrected later. It is another matter if the alleged "miscalculation" or the method of allocation of payments have been consistently and continuously present in the Plaintiff's accounting practices. The former is an error and the latter is a course of conduct. The former would clearly present a reasonably arguable case for the Plaintiff. The latter might still present an arguable case, but the very significant increase between the amounts now asserted and the amounts that would then have been historically charged by the Plaintiff might have justified setting bail at a lower amount.
