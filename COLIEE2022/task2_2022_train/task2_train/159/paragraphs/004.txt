  Both parties have presented evidence as to what the Plaintiff's reasonably arguable best case ought to be. The issues are contentious, the evidence contradictory, and clearly incomplete. At the hearing, I asked the Defendant's counsel what standard the Court should apply in weighing the evidence before it. Counsel could point to no authority that would have discussed or determined that standard, but suggested that the standard should be similar to that applied to motions for summary judgment. In other words, a Plaintiff is prima facie entitled to such security as will cover the amounts claimed in its statement of claim and affidavit to lead warrant. Once a Defendant files a motion to set the bail at a lower amount, it would then behoove the Plaintiff, as if it were facing a motion for summary judgment, to put its best foot forward to show that the amount as claimed constitutes a genuine issue for trial; the Plaintiff did not disagree with that suggestion. I am not certain that such a standard might not be setting the bar higher than it ought to be for the Plaintiff. Â [see footnote 1] Nevertheless, applying that standard as the standard most favourable to the Defendant, it is my conclusion that the amount of bail already filed by the Defendant ought not to be reduced.
