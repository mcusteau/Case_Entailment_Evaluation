  The facts surrounding the filing of a caveat warrant and the issuance of a warrant of arrest are as follows: On August 26, 2005, the Plaintiff transmitted to the Defendant a copy of the statement of claim issued herein, demanding either satisfactory resolution of its claim or acceptable security within three days, failing which it would arrest one of the Defendant vessels. On August 30, 2005, the Defendant filed a caveat warrant in form 493 of the Federal Courts Rules, undertaking to give bail in an amount of up to $1,600,000.00 "within three (3) days after being required to do so". The Plaintiff took the position that its letter of August 26, 2005 triggered the undertaking contained in the caveat warrant. The Defendant took the view that the three day delay provided for in the caveat warrant ran from the time it was "required" to furnish security, and that the requirement had to come from the Court, either in the form of a notice that an affidavit to lead warrant had been filed or by way of direction, and could not come from the Plaintiff itself. Upon this impasse, the Plaintiff not only elected to file an affidavit to lead warrant but to request the issuance of a warrant, which it did on September 7, 2005. The warrant was issued after the Registry had duly notified the Plaintiff of the existence of the caveat warrant and the provisions of Rule 494(1). One of the Defendant vessels having been scheduled to berth at St-Romuald on September 9, 2005, the Defendant filed a motion to quash the warrants of arrest and set the form and amount of bail and asked that it be heard prior to the arrival of the vessel at St-Romuald. It is to be noted that whilst there initially was an issue between the parties as to the form of the bank letter of guarantee which the Defendant proposed to file as bail, the bulk of the Defendant's motion concerned the quashing of the warrants on the grounds of the absence of a right in rem against the vessels and the fixing of bail to an amount less than the $1.6 million set out in the caveat warrant. Eventually, the parties reached an agreement as to the form of the letter of guarantee, which allowed bail to be posted without the arrest of a vessel and without the need for a determination by the Court, and leaving the issues of the validity of the warrants and the appropriate amount of bail to be determined at a later and less hurried date.
