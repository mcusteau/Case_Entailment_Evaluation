 [6] 
  There is sufficient evidence on the record before me to establish, on a prima facie basis, the existence of a written agreement between the parties that outstanding invoices should bear interest at the rate claimed by the Plaintiff, in accordance with the calculations made by the Plaintiff, and that payments made by the Defendant could properly have been allocated by the Plaintiff so as to support the full amount of the claim as presented. The Defendant's approach to this motion has not been to undermine the prima facie validity of the Plaintiff's claim and calculations but to establish its own defence to the claim. Indeed, the Defendant asserts the following defences: 
 
 
 
 (a) that whatever the written contractual terms contained in the Plaintiff's invoices, statements of account or general terms and conditions, those are superseded by an agreement between the parties that the Defendant would not pay any interest on any of the Plaintiff's invoices even when overdue; 
 
 
 
 (b) that in light of its conduct during the seven years of the business relationship between the parties, and as a result of certain representations made by the Plaintiff to the Defendant, the Plaintiff has waived or should be estopped from claiming interest on the amounts overdue; or 
 
 
 
 (c) in the alternative, that if it is entitled to claim interest, the Plaintiff's claim should be limited to the amount of $277,537.34 plus interest at the rate of 26.825% per annum from June 15, 2005, the whole as per the Plaintiff's own calculations contained in a statement of account prepared on June 15, 2005 and which the Defendant submits constitute a binding extrajudicial admission.
