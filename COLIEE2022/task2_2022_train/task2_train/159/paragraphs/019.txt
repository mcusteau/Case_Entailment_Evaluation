  However, the Defendant's motion and the costs associated with it do not arise as a result of the issuance of the warrant. Had the Plaintiff proceeded in the manner suggested by the Defendant - by filing an affidavit to lead warrant and a request for the Court to direct the Defendant to file bail in accordance with the caveat warrant - it is clear that the Defendant would have brought the same motion for the same relief. Indeed, save for that part of the motion seeking directions as to the form of the letter of guarantee, the ultimate purpose of the motion is not to rectify the consequences of the Plaintiff having arrested the vessel despite the Defendant's undertaking to file bail, but to relieve the Defendant of the obligation to comply to the full extent of the undertaking given as part of its caveat warrant. I am not questioning here the ability of a Defendant who has filed a caveat warrant to seek judicial determination of the validity of the in rem proceedings or of the amount of bail that should be given, but I cannot see how that exercise results from the issuance of a warrant; nor can I see why its costs should automatically fall on the Plaintiff, whatever the outcome, due to the mere fact that a caveat warrant had been filed.
