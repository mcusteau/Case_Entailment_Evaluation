  As to the Defendant's argument of a general estoppel or waiver, it is not so much based on evidence of the Plaintiff's conduct toward the Defendant as on the Defendant's own conduct in having never acknowledged or paid interest on outstanding invoices. Furthermore, is lacking from the Defendant's evidence any element tending the show that the Defendant altered its conduct or acted in any way to its prejudice in reliance on the expectation that the Plaintiff would not claim interest. That second argument of the Defendant therefore also fails to cast sufficient doubt that the amounts claimed by the Plaintiff are reasonably arguable.
