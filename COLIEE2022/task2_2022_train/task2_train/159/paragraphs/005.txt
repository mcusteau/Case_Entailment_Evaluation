  The Plaintiff's claim is for amounts outstanding under invoices issued for goods and services provided, together with interests and penalties allegedly accruing thereon. On the motion before me, the initial amounts covered by the invoices are not at issue, nor is it at issue that the Defendant has paid a substantial portion of the initial invoices. The Defendant in fact concedes that the Plaintiff has a reasonably arguable case to claim the sum of $104,753.25 in capital outstanding on the invoices. The bone of contention between the parties is whether the Plaintiff is entitled to claim interest on outstanding invoices at all, and if so, how and from when such interest should be calculated and how payments made by the Defendants should be or should have been applied by the Plaintiff as between capital outstanding and accrued interest.
