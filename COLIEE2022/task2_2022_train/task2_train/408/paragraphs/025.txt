Mr. Moir, employed as he is, would be more familiar with the various wines and spirits and their packaging than the average customer. Certainly he was the victim of confusion at the beginning. He states in paragraphs 3 to 7:
"3. On or about March 18, 1987, I set up the in-store display and price labelling for cases of Andres Splitz Wildberry cooler, a product newly listed with the Branch, which had only very recently been delivered for sale in the Westview Liquor Store.
"4. On or about March 18, 1987, while I was working at the Westview Liquor Store, I spoke to a man whom I knew as John whom I recognized as a representative of the liquor supplier Seagrams.
"5. I advised John that the Westview Liquor Store had recently received his new cooler product.
"6. On showing the cases of cooler to John, I realized that the product could not be Seagrams and I apologized to John for my error.
"7. I have read and considered the affidavit of John Justus Floto sworn on April 10, 1987."
