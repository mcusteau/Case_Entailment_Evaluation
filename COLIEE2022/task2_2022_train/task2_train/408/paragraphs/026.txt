Mr. Floto states in paragraphs 4 to 7 of his affidavit:
"4. During my visit at the Westview Liquor Store, I spoke with David Moir, a merchandise clerk employed at that store. Mr. Moir advise me, and I verily believe same to be true, that he had received and set up an in-store display for my Company's new WILDBERRY Cooler.
"5. Mr. Moir further advised me and I verily believe same to be true, that he had placed this display in the previous spot used by my Company's Rye Cooler and that everything had worked out well.
"6. I asked Mr. Moir to show me the display and, upon seeing the display, I discovered that, in fact, the display was not of Seagram's product WILDBERRY Vodka Cooler, but instead it was a display of a wine cooler marketed, sold and distributed by Andres Wines Ltd., bearing the word WILDBERRY on the label.
"7. I indicated to Mr. Moir that the coolers which were being displayed were in actual fact not my Company's WILDBERRY Vodka Cooler but were in fact coolers sold and distributed by a competitor, Andres Wines Ltd. At that time, Mr. Moir appeared surprised to learn this."
To be fair, Mr. Moir tells why he was confused in paragraph 16 of his affidavit:
"I connected Andres Splitz Wildberry Cooler with Seagrams without thinking because I had very recently heard that certain Seagram's products had been recalled due to a problem with glass particles in the bottles. A newspaper article which I had read on the morning of March 18, 1987, before I spoke to Mr. Floto, stated that Seagrams Wildberry Vodka Cooler was being recalled in other Canadian jurisdictions which stocked that product. The Seagram's recall was the subject of much discussion in the Westview Liquor Store. Since the Store carried no wildberry coolers until the arrival of Andres Splitz Wildberry Cooler into the Store on March 17, 1987, I linked the Andres' product to Seagrams due to the words 'wildberry' and 'cooler' in both products. I knew, however, that the products were different."
