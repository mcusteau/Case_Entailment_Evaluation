I pointed out to counsel for both parties that a motion dealing with an interlocutory injunction was not the occasion to attack the validity of a registration. Other avenues were available to the defendant if it wished to challenge the registration. Counsel for the plaintiff was correct therefore when he stated: "The validity of the registration of a trademark should not be considered in an interlocutory motion." and cited Pacific Produce v.
