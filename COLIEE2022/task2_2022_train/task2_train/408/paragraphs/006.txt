In March 1987, the defendant commenced advertising a wine cooler in association with WILDBERRY for sale as of April 1, 1987 in British Columbia. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant's use of the mark is likely to cause and has caused confusion with the plaintiff's vodka cooler, and especially so since the defendant's wine cooler is the same colour as the vodka cooler and the colour scheme on the bottles and packaging is similar.
