In support of this argument, the applicants rely upon a statement by Justice Stone of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Rajaratnam v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1991] F.C.J. No. 1271; 135 N.R. 300 (F.C.A.) (
Rajaratnam
), in which he observed that the Court was concerned "that the Board Member, by her questioning, may have removed her judicial hat and put on the hat of an advocate". This arose in the context of extensive questioning by the Member after the evidence of the claimant had already been elicited by counsel and the refugee hearing officer. Justice Stone referred to the principles respecting judicial intervention in hearings and concluded that the questioning had remained within the bounds of propriety.
