Under
IRPA
s. 161, the IRB Chairperson may also make rules respecting, among other things, the "activities, practice and procedure" of each division of the Board. Rules made under this authority require the approval of the Governor-in-Council and must be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of such approval. I note that there are no similar requirements for guidelines or jurisprudential guides under paragraph 159(1)(h). See
