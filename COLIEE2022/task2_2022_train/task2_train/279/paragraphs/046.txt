Two notices of constitutional question were served on the federal and provincial Attorneys General in these proceedings as required by s. 57 of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. The Notice filed in Benitez (IMM-9766-04) identifies three constitutional issues. They are: (1) that the order of questioning mandated by paragraph 19 of Guideline 7 is contrary to s. 7 of the
Charter
; (2) that Guideline 7 is also contrary to s. 15 of the
Charter
because persons appearing before other tribunals have a right to present their evidence first, have their counsel present their evidence first, and have their counsel question first; and (3) that the failure to implement the Refugee Appeal Division is contrary to s. 7. This third issue was not argued at the hearing. The Notice filed in
Jones
(IMM-1877-05) states that by permitting the Board member to conduct an examination-in-chief of the claimant, paragraph 19 breaches the right to a fair and independent judiciary resulting in a reasonable apprehension of bias which is contrary to s. 7 of the
Charter
.
