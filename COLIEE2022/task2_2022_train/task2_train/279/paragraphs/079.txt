The applicants rely in particular upon two decisions of this Court:
Herrera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 75; 2004 FC 1724; [2005] F.C.J. No. 118 (
Herrera
) and
Sandor v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2004), 266 F.T.R. 311; 2004 FC 1782 (
Sandor
).
Herrera
was considered by Justice Blanchard and distinguished.
Sandor
was, I believe, not addressed before Justice Blanchard.
