As noted above, the factors to be considered in determining whether the common law duty of fairness has been met by the procedures in question were discussed by Justice L'Heureux-Dubé in

1. The nature of the decision being made and the process followed in making it.
2. The role of the particular decision within the statutory scheme.
3. The importance of the decision to the individual affected.
4. The legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision where undertakings were made as to the procedure to be followed.
5. Whether the decision-maker is empowered by statute to set its own procedures.
