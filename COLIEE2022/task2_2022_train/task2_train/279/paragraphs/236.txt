Turning to the application of these principles to the cases before me, I make the following findings:
- Cases in which there was no waiver because of a timely objection at or before the Board hearing and the denial of procedural fairness was identified as a ground for judicial review in the leave application either expressly or through a basket clause: IMM-9766-04 (Restrepo Benitez); IMM-1144-05 (Qadri); IMM-4044-05 (Roy); IMM-470-05 (Martinez & others); IMM-2150-05 (Matheen); IMM-353-05 (Rincon & others); IMM-1419-05 (Gomez & others); IMM-1877-05 (Jones); IMM-712-05 (Guirguis & others); IMM-407-05 (Mejia); IMM-9797-04 (Bilomba); IMM-2709-05 (Trujillo); IMM-2034-05 (Ortiz). These applications are not barred from proceeding on the procedural fairness issue in relation to the application of Guideline 7 in that case.
- Cases in which no objection was raised before or during the hearing and for which waiver will be implied: IMM-4064-05 (Kamalendran); IMM-9220-04 & IMM-3994-05 (Arachchige); IMM-3313-05 (Robinson); IMM-9452-04 (Gyankoma); IMM-934-05 (Savagoli). These applications are barred from proceeding on the ground of procedural unfairness in relation to Guideline 7.
