Justice Blanchard took into account the fact that
IRPA
ss. 110 and 111 creating the appeal division had not been brought into force in finding that the second factor called for greater protection. I have nothing to add to his conclusion in that regard other than to note that the appeal provided for in the unproclaimed sections was to be conducted on the basis of the record of the refugee determination proceedings below rather than through an oral hearing. Judicial review is not an appeal and this does not detract from the significance of the factor in the
Baker
analysis but in so far as that record may disclose procedural unfairness that may be addressed in an application for judicial review to this Court.
The nature of the decision being made by the administrative tribunal and the process followed in making that decision.
