, Justice Blanchard did not make a specific finding as to whether the Chairperson's authority was exceeded by Guideline 7. He noted, however, at paragraph 103 of his reasons that while the enactment explicitly authorized the Chairperson to make and issue guidelines to assist members in carrying out their duties, the guidelines cannot be mandatory in the sense that they leave little room for the exercise of discretion by each Board member to conduct a full and proper hearing.
