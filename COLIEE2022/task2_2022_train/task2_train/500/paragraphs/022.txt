It is with this standard in mind that I will now proceed with an analysis of the first leg of the
Toth
test. Counsel for the Applicant contends that there is a duty on the enforcement officer to consider the best interests of the children when the removal of a parent is being arranged. She argued that Mrs. Farrauto refused to defer the removal, despite awareness that there were no travel documents as yet for the children and that the mother was seeking sole custody so that the children can go with her if she must leave. It was submitted that the Officer has not demonstrated that she has been alive, alert and sensitive to the best interests of the children, and has not made any inquiries as to what would happen to the children if they could not leave with their mother.
