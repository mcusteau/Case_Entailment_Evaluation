Much has been made of the decision reached by this Court in
Martinez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 799; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1695 (F.C.), where my colleague Justice Simpson found that where a parent is being removed and the children are remaining in Canada, the removals officer should defer the removal pending the outcome of the H & C application in order to give effect to Canada's obligations under Article 1 of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child
. Justice Simpson was of the view that s. 3(3)(f) of the
IRPA
has "incorporated" the
Convention
into our domestic law "to the extent that the
IRPA
must be construed and applied in a manner that is consistent with the
Convention
". This
Convention
deals with the rights of children and recognizes in its preamble that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance.
