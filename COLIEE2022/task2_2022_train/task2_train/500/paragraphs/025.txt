Needless to say, counsel for the Respondent vigorously opposed this argument. First, he objects to the notion that s. 3(3)(f) has incorporated the
Convention
into our domestic law, since it is neither precise nor detailed enough to make the international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory part of Canadian domestic law. This section would be no more than a codification of the canon of statutory interpretation that says that, as far as possible, domestic law should be interpreted in accordance with international obligations. The inclusion of s. 3(3)f) cannot be used to ignore or substantially rewrite provisions of the
IRPA
, it is contended, which is precisely what would happen if an undecided H & C application was to bar removal.
