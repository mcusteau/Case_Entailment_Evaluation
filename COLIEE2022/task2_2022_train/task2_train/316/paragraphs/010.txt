The officer's comprehensive, and indeed, exhaustive, review of the documentary evidence is comprised of some five and one-half pages, single-spaced. It was open to the PRRA officer to prefer the contents of the documentary evidence over that submitted by Ms. Augusto. The 2002 ceasefire between the Angolan government and UNITA as well as the passing of the amnesty law and its application were both specifically noted. It was on the basis of that evidence that the officer rejected the notification. Alternatively, the officer determined, on the basis of the same documentary evidence, that there was no reason to believe that Ms. Augusto would not be granted amnesty. Those findings were certainly available to the PRRA officer on the evidence that was before her.
