Layden-Stevenson, J.
: Ms. Augusto is a citizen of Angola. On May 4, 2004, a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) officer rejected her application for protection. This is an application for judicial review of the PRRA officer's decision. Despite the articulate submissions of counsel for the applicant, I have determined that the application must be dismissed.
