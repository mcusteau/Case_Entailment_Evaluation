Having closely reviewed the reasons in each of the cases cited above and considered the arguments of counsel, I see no reason to depart from the conclusions reached by my colleague in
Thamotharem
on the correct interpretation of these prior decisions. While the reasons for decision contain statements which may be construed as lending support for the notion that a fair hearing requires that the claimant's counsel question first, a close examination discloses that the Court in each case was more concerned with whether the hearing, as a whole, was fair than with the order of questioning. The order of questioning may have contributed to unfairness in a particular case but was not determinative of that finding.
