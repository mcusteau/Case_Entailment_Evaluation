[151]
In exhibits A-8 and A-9, the Member does not consider the particular circumstances of the claimant before him but addresses the validity of the Guideline in general. Although it is not clear from his reasons whether the Member considered whether the applicant before him fell within the paragraph 23 examples, a review of the Tribunal Record for each of these cases (which are part of the consolidated action) shows that the applicant's counsel in each case did not raise a specific objection to the implementation of Guideline 7 based on the circumstances of the particular claimant. Counsel raised only a general objection to the Guideline without stating why the claimant should be questioned by counsel first.
