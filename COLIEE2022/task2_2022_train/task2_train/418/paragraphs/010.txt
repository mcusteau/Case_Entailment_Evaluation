In keeping with the consolidation order, submissions from counsel respecting the facts in relation to each application for judicial review were not received in this hearing except to the extent that counsel deemed it necessary to refer to them in support of their arguments respecting the Guideline 7 issues. Counsel did draw the Court's attention to the particular circumstances of certain applicants for whom an increased susceptibility to stress in a hearing room and to questioning by strangers could be inferred. Counsel also referred to portions of the transcripts of the refugee determination hearings to illustrate certain points in issue.
