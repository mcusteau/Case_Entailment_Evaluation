According to Mr. Aterman's affidavit evidence, the standard order of questioning was introduced as part of an Action Plan to increase the Board's efficiency, decrease the average time of a hearing and reduce burdens on the Board's resources while maintaining fairness. The applicants challenge these assertions as unfounded and unwarranted. The change, they say, has had little effect on hearing times or the overall disposition rate for refugee determinations but has denied claimants their rights to the effective assistance of counsel and to be heard, both of which are aspects of fundamental justice and procedural fairness.
