The question was raised in
Rajaratnam
by the Court on its own motion and does not appear to have been fully argued by the parties. Moreover it occurred in the context of proceedings under the former legislation and the order of questioning was not in issue. Justice Stone's discussion supports the principles that a Board member must act fairly, impartially and judiciously, and does not stand, in my view, for the proposition that a member should not question a claimant or, indeed, that a member may not question in advance of the claimant's counsel.
