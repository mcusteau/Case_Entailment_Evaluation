Mr. Aterman's evidence is that in drafting the guideline, a deliberate choice was made to avoid the use of terminology such as "examination-in-chief" and "cross-examination" as inappropriate concepts better suited to an adversarial model requiring judicial formality. Attached to his affidavit as Exhibit "N" is a copy of the Board's training handout entitled "Questioning 101" which instructs new members and RPOs that they are not to "cross-examine" claimants, or employ aggressive techniques such as attempting to trap the claimant, to badger or harass by repetitious or misleading questions or to adopt a hostile or sarcastic tone. The object is not to try to "win" a case.
