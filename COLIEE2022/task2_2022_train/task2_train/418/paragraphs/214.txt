The reasoning of Justice MacGuigan was applied by the Court of Appeal in
Yassine v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1994), 172 N.R. 308; 27 Imm. L.R.(2d) 135 (F.C.A.), where an applicant did not object until after the Refugee Division's decision was released. Justice Stone for the Court stated at paragraph 7:
"It must also be noted that no objection was taken to the procedure that the Presiding Member adopted for receiving the additional information ... That surely was the time to raise an objection and to ask the panel to reconvene the hearing, assuming that the information could not otherwise be received. The appellant was then in possession of all of the new information and was aware that the panel intended to take notice of it.
Not only was no objection made at that time, which I would regard as the 'earliest practicable opportunity' to do so ... the appellant remained silent until after the Refugee Division's decision was released on April 18, 1991. Thus, even if a breach of natural justice did occur, I view the appellant's conduct as an implied waiver of that breach.
