It is clear that Parliament has left much to the Board to decide through the Chairperson's rule and guideline-making authority with respect to its own procedures. In giving weight to the choices made by the Board respecting its procedures, it is not necessary for the Court to conclude that these procedures have been effective or the best choice. That choice is for the Board to make, recognizing always that the application of the Board's procedures in an individual case may result in a denial of fairness. It is not appropriate, in my view, for the Court, in hindsight, to substitute its own view of what procedure would be preferable unless it is necessary to ensure natural justice.
