[144]
In urging me to depart from these conclusions, the respondent submits that the language of the Guideline has to be read as permissive rather than mandatory in keeping with the principles established in
Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Canada et al.
, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2; 44 N.R. 354; 137 D.L.R.(3d) 558, that discretion given by statute cannot be confined by general policy statements and that a term such as "will normally" does not mean "in every case". Here, the respondent submits, the contextual evidence including the Board's policy on the use of guidelines, indicate that members retain discretion to vary the order of questioning where they deem it appropriate.
