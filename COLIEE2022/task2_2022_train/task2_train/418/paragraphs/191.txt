[191]
In
Régie
, the Supreme Court dealt with the question of the independence of quasi-judicial tribunals in the context of s. 23 of the Quebec
Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms
, R.S.Q., c. C-12, which guarantees the right to a full and equal, public and fair hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. As explained in
Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. Liquor Control and Licensing Branch (B.C.)
, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 781; 274 N.R. 116; 155 B.C.A.C. 193; 254 W.A.C. 193; 2001 SCC 52, the standard of independence articulated in
Régie
stemmed from the Quebec
Charter
, a quasi-constitutional statute, and does not apply to tribunals created by other jurisdictions. In other contexts, the standard is to be determined by the express will of the legislature. If the legislation is silent or insufficiently precise, the courts will generally infer that Parliament or the legislature intended that the tribunal's process will comport with the principles of natural justice. In some instances, but generally not, the tribunal may attract
Charter
requirements of independence.
