Reference was made during argument to a decision by Board Member K. Brennenstuhl,
R.K.N., Re
, [2004] R.P.D.D. No. 14, which was apparently distributed to other RPD members for their assistance on the interpretation and application of Guideline 7. This action was cited by the applicants as illustrating the Board's efforts to impose Guideline 7 on the RPD members and thereby fetter their discretion. However, the distribution of the decision is not in my view evidence of fettering so long as members did not consider themselves bound to follow Member Brennenstuhl's conclusions. There is no evidence before me that this was the case. The
R.K.N.
decision has not been identified by the Chairperson as a jurisprudential guide nor does it fall within the category of "persuasive decision", which the Deputy Chair, Refugee Protection Division may designate under a policy adopted by the Board as "models of sound reasoning" which members are encouraged to adopt. See the Board's Policy Note on Persuasive Decisions, December 13, 2005.
