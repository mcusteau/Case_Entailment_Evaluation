dealt with a policy which provided that counsel were not permitted to attend interviews with visa officers. The Court of Appeal concluded, at paragraphs 74-77, that the policy fettered the discretion of visa officers because of the mandatory nature of the language used, there was no indication that the officers had a duty to consider the particular circumstances of each case, the policy gave no guidance to the officers as to how to exercise that discretion other than to deny the attendance of counsel in each case, the objective evidence indicated that the officer in question treated the policy as fettering his discretion and the respondent had offered no evidence to indicate that counsel had ever been allowed to attend.
