The Board should not be held to the same procedural standards as a judicial body. In
Kozak
, above, the Court of Appeal in commenting on the Board's "uniquely difficult mandate of administrative adjudication" had this to say at paragraph 56:
"In view of these challenges, the Board has had to devise means of maintaining and enhancing the consistency and quality of its decisions, which is of critical importance to its ability to perform its statutory functions and to retain its legitimacy.
To this end, the Board's procedure should not be confined in a model of due process that draws exclusively on the judicial paradigm and discourages innovation.
Nonetheless, procedures designed to increase quality and consistency cannot be adopted at the expense of the duty of each panel to afford to the claimant before it a high degree of impartiality and independence." (Emphasis added)
