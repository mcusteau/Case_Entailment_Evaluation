The Guideline contemplates that the RPD will define the issues which are to be addressed at the hearing through disclosure of the RPD File Screening Form with the Notice to Appear for the hearing and that questioning would be limited to those issues and any others that the claimant may wish to submit. Guideline 7 covers matters such as case preparation, disclosure of documents, research requests, pre-hearing conferences, interpretation and the making of representations. The Guideline also stipulates the order of questioning where the Minister intervenes on the issue of exclusion, on other issues, or in an application to vacate or cease refugee protection.
