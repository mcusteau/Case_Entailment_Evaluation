I note that in
Stumf et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2002), 289 N.R. 165; 2002 FCA 148, the Court of Appeal allowed the applicants to raise an issue in oral arguments which had not been raised in the judicial review or in any of the proceedings before the Board. The issue in this case was the failure of the Board to consider the designation of a representative for a minor refugee applicant as required by s. 69(4) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2. The Court determined that it was appropriate to consider it at that time because the record disclosed all of the relevant facts, and there was no suggestion that the Minister would be prejudiced if the issue was considered.
