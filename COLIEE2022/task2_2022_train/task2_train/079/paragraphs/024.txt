  The case of  
 Baron 
 , above, makes it clear that section 48 of the IRPA gives very limited discretion to officers to defer removal orders ( 
 Baron 
  at para. 49). The existence of an H&C application, in and of itself, does not constitute grounds for deferral of a valid removal order ( 
 Baron 
  at para. 50).
