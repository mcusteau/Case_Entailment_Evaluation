  The question of how thoroughly a removals officer must consider the best interests of the child was canvassed in  
 Munar 
 , above. Justice Yves de Montigny held: 
 
 
 
 [40] This is obviously not the kind of assessment that the removal officer is expected to undertake when deciding whether the enforcement of the removal order is "reasonably practicable." What he should be considering, however, are the short-term best interests of the child. For example, it is certainly within the removal officer's discretion to defer removal until a child has terminated his or her school year, if he or she is going with his or her parent. Similarly, I cannot bring myself to the conclusion that the removal officer should not satisfy himself that provisions have been made for leaving a child in the care of others in Canada when parents are to be removed. This is clearly within his mandate, if section 48 of the IRPA is to be read consistently with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. To make enquiries as to whether a child will be adequately looked after does not amount to a fulsome H&C assessment and in no way duplicates the role of the immigration officer who will eventually deal with such an application (see Boniowski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2004), 44 Imm. L.R. (3d) 31 (F.C.)). 
 
 
 
 [41] In the present case, the two kids of the applicant are very young, and nobody seems prepared to care for them besides their mother. Yet, she cannot take them with her since her application for an order seeking sole [page680] custody has not yet been dealt with. Therefore, I conclude that the applicant has raised a serious question, even on the more probing standard required in a case like this one, when claiming that the removal officer failed to exercise her discretion appropriately and was not "alert, alive and sensitive" to the childrens' best interests.
