Generally speaking, Sergeant Stanley described a period of several days, his recollection of the exact length of this period being somewhat vague, where the plaintiff drove his truck to the gate house area at the station, waited there for a short period of time, and then left without entering the station or picking up the garbage. Sergeant Stanley was unable to pinpoint the dates upon which these incidents occurred, stating only that this was "in a period of seven to ten days after the incident involving Corporal Durand and the finding of the weapon". Sergeant Stanley could not recall, but did not contradict the plaintiff's evidence with respect to the plaintiff's repeated encounters and conversations with him on the subject of the decal and the necessity for removing it from the car, and turning it in at the station. The Sergeant also testified that there were three days when the Abensteins did not even appear at the station to pick up garbage, testimony which was contradictory to that of the Abensteins, was not supported by a letter from Lieutenant Gregory upon which Mr. Grouette relied in his decision to terminate the contract, and which was not consistent with the pleadings of the defendant.
