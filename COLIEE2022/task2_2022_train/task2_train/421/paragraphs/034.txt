In this case, as noted above, the statement of defence sets out the particulars of the alleged breach or default by the plaintiff. The plaintiff conceded that he did not arrive at the station on October 16, 1985, until approximately 7:00 p.m., some hours past the time specified for garbage pickup in the specifications of the contract. The plaintiff's testimony, uncontradicted, was that in the thirteen years he had been picking up garbage from the station, he had been late on one or two, or perhaps a few other occasions without incurring any criticism or penalty from the authorities at the station. There can be no doubt that the plaintiff's lateness was in breach of his contract. I am not satisfied, however, that taken alone his breach amounts to something which "goes to the root of the contract". The occurrence of this event alone by no means deprived the defendants of substantially the whole benefit of the contract. Indeed, though late that day he was admitted to the station and did complete the pickup of the garbage. To rely upon one of the indicators suggested in Waddams, "the quantitative ratio of the party's obligation affected by the nonperformance to the obligation as a whole", the effect of the plaintiff's tardiness on one day in attending to pick up the garbage was negligible in relation to his ability to carry out the terms of his contract competently over a two-year period.
