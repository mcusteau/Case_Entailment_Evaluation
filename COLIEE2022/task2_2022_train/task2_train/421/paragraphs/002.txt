The plaintiff had a contract with the defendant for the removal and disposal of garbage and ash at the Canadian Forces Station Beausejour. The plaintiff had provided similar services under a series of contracts, renewed annually or bi-annually, over a period of approximately thirteen years. He lived some two miles from the station, near Lac du Bonnet. The contract required that he provide his own truck, travel daily to the station and load garbage, and dispose of the garbage at a municipal dumpsite which was located some seven miles beyond his home. While he did not travel to the dump site every day, rather he did so as required three or four times a week, the round trip from his home to the dumpsite to home was about 18 miles. In recent years, because of his health condition Mr. Abenstein was always accompanied on his trips to the station by his wife or his son and when he was ill his wife undertook garbage removal responsibilities for him.
