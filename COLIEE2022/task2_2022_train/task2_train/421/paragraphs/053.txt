[53]
On this basis, therefore, I am unable to conclude that the plaintiff is entitled to an award of damages in the amount of the full balance of the contract price, without deducting the portion of that balance which, had the contract continued, he would have been obliged to spend on expenses related to the contract. To make the plaintiff an award of the full balance would be to place him in a much better position than he would have occupied had the defendant performed his promise. The plaintiff is entitled only to be placed in the same position as he would have been if the contract had been performed.
