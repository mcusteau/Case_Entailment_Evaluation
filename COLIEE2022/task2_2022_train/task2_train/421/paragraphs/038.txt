The clairty of the plaintiff's description of these events when contrasted with the vague recollection offered by Sergeant Stanley encourages me to accept the plaintiff's version of what transpired over that of Sergeant Stanley. I am further persuaded by the corroboration of the plaintiff's evidence provided by the testimony of his wife, Mrs. Abenstein. Finally, notwithstanding that it is the defendant who has, in its particulars, cited the plaintiff's failure to pick up garbage on the three particular dates in October 1985, only the plaintiff was able, with any certainty, to recall what took place on those dates. The defendant called no witness capable of testifying as to what took place, or failed to take place, on the specific dates set out in the particulars.
