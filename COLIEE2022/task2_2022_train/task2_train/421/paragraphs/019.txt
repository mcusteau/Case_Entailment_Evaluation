The plaintiff argues that his termination was wrongful and in breach of his contract. He maintains that he has been willing and able, at all material times, to perform the agreement, and by its termination that he suffered loss and damages. The defendant, on the other hand, maintains that the plaintiff defaulted in carrying out the express terms and conditions of the contract in October 1985, and that in light of the breach of the contract by the plaintiff, the defendant was entitled to terminate the contract pursuant to the General Conditions which formed part of the contract.
