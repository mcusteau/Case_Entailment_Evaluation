According to Corporal Durand, the plaintiff became irritated when informed that a spot check search of the truck was required. Corporal Durand states that he found a box of "ammo" in the glove compartment of the plaintiff's truck and behind the seat, a firearm which was fully assembled but not loaded. Corporal Durand maintains that the plaintiff informed him that he had no registration or paperwork relating to the gun with him. The corporal states that after having made sure that both barrels of the gun were not loaded, he returned the firearm to the plaintiff. Although a report of this incident was made available to the station security officer, Sergeant Stanley, by Corporal Durand, the latter himself had no further dealings with the plaintiff.
