On the evidence before me I conclude that there was never any agreement on the part of the Abensteins to the terms set out in DSS 9076. Nevertheless, that document was specifically referred to and incorporated by reference in the contract by clause G5. In the circumstances of this case, however, contract clause G5 was ambiguous and the interpretation attributed to it by Mrs. Abenstein was not unreasonable. Thus, clause 16(1) in DSS 9076, drafted by the defendant but not provided to the plaintiff, ought not to be construed for the benefit of the defendant in the circumstances of this case. That means at least that the plaintiff ought not to be in any worse position under clause 16(1) of DSS 9076 than he would be at common law if the defendant had acted without claiming to do so under clause 16(1). Thus, so far as that clause relates to default by the contractor, that default must be comparable to a fundamental breach of contract at common law.
