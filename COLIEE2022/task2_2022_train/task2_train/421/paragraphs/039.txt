Accordingly, it is left to me to assess whether or not, in light of the plaintiff's testimony, his failure to pick up the garbage at the station on October 17, 18 and 19, 1985 amounts to a fundamental breach of contract. Did the plaintiff's failure to pick up the garbage on the three days in question deprive the defendant of substantially the whole benefit which it was to obtain from the contract? Did his breach "go to the root of the contract"?
