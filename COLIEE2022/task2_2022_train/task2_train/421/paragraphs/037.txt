The plaintiff and his wife, on the other hand, provided a clear and logical explanation for their actions on the three days in question, and for their failure to pick up the garbage on those days. According to the plaintiff and his wife, their efforts to pick up the garbage from the station on the 17th, 18th and 19th of October were frustrated by Sergeant Stanley's insistence upon their compliance with a number of requests relating to the decal pass on the plaintiff's windshield. In contrast to Sergeant Stanley's assertion that the plaintiff and his wife made no attempt to gain entry to the station, the plaintiff and his wife have testified that they attempted to do so, but were thwarted in their attempts by the following requests.
a) On October 17, 1985 Sergeant Stanley informed the plaintiff he would have to stop using the decal "pass" on the windshield and switch to a daily pass system. The plaintiff was informed that no daily pass would be issued until the decal was removed from the truck. Finding it impossible to remove the decal, the plaintiff left the station.
b) On October 18, 1985, the plaintiff, having been unable to remove the decal, which was attached with "crazy glue", arrived at the station with the decal covered with masking tape. Again they were informed by Sergeant Stanley that they could not enter the station until the decal was removed from the windshield. Again the plaintiff and his wife left the station without entering.
c) On October 19, 1985, the plaintiff and his wife attended at the station with the decal removed from the windshield, whereupon Sergeant Stanley informed them that they would be required to turn the decal in at the station before they would be issued a daily pass. Since the plaintiff did not have the removed decal with him in the truck, he and his wife once again left the station without entering.
