The following morning the plaintiff attended at the station to pick up the garbage, pursuant to the terms of his contract. At the gate to the station he was informed by Sergeant Stanley that he would have to stop using the decal "pass" on his windshield and switch to a daily pass system, under which he would be required to sign for a new pass to be issued each day. The plaintiff was informed that the decal would have to be removed from the windshield.
