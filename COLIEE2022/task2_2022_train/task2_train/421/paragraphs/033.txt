Finally, what kinds of factors are relevant in determining whether a breach is sufficiently substantial to justify nonperformance by the innocent party? According to S.M. Waddams, The Law of Contracts (2nd Ed., 1984) at p. 445:

The quantitative ratio of the party's obligation affected by the nonperformance to the obligation as a whole; the seriousness of the breach to the innocent party; the probability of repetition; the seriousness of the consequences of the breach in the particular case; the relationship of the part of the obligation performed to the whole obligation; all these are obvious indicators."
