  To conclude on this "confusion" analysis, the only new evidence which is material is that of Mr. Hamid who has provided some evidence of use of the "Marché" trade-mark in Canada. However, when weighed against the Esso evidence, the Registrar would not have been persuaded to change her mind. However, if I am wrong on that point, in assessing all the evidence pertaining to surrounding circumstances, including those specifically enumerated in section 6(5) of the Act, I find there is no likelihood of confusion, in that the mythical consumer would not likely think that "Marché Express" and "Marché" services came from the same source.
