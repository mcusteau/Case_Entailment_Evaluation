  Section 30(b) of the Act requires an application to state the date from which the trade-mark was used in Canada. The only evidence before the Registrar was an affidavit from Barry Murphy, Mr. Levins' predecessor as Imperial oil's convenience retailing manager. He was not personally present at the first "Marché Express" when it opened on 18 July 2001. Rather, he relied on business information to state the date of first use, the number of "Marché Express" stores in Quebec at the date of his affidavit, total sales, and details of moneys spent in advertising.
