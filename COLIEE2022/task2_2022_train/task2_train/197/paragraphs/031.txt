  There is, or was, a "Marché Express" dépanneur in St-Lambert, Quebec. That is the name used on a cash register receipt. However the name on the storefront is "Alimentation Diana Dépanneur". There is also a "Dépanneur Marché Express 2000" although it is not clear whether a store was ever operated under that name. Furthermore, there was a "Marché Express Tabagie et Dépanneur Enr." and finally "Au Vieux Duluth Marché Express". If "Marché Express" says it all, why use the word "dépanneur"? One could just as easily have said "Au Vieux Duluth Dépanneur".
