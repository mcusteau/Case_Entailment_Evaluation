 Harrington, J. 
 : A customer pulls into an Esso gas station to fill up. While there, he or she takes advantage of the adjacent  
 Marché Express 
  to run in and buy a loaf of bread, a litre of milk, baby diapers, the newspaper and a hot coffee and muffin to go. Is it likely that such a person would think that the same people were behind both the  
 Marché Express 
  convenience stores and the  
 Marché 
  restaurants?
