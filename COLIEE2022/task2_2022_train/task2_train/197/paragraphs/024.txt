  Mövenpick also relies on the new evidence of Esso's marketing expert, Alain D'Astous, who in cross-examination on his affidavit applied Gestalt principles to interpret the meaning of "Marché Express". However, for the same reasons given with respect to the evidence of the linguists, I do not consider this evidence helpful.
