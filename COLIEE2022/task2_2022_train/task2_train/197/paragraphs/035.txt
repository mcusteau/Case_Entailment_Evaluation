  In this appeal, Mövenpick seeks a declaration that "Marché Express", when used in association "with fast-food services offered at gasoline stations" is confusing with its registered trade-mark "Marché" for use in association with the "operation of restaurant". Note that it breaks down Esso's application which is for "convenience store and fast-food services offered at gasoline stations", not simply "fast-food services". I shall return to this point.
