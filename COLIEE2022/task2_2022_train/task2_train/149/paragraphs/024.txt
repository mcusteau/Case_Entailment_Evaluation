  In Ashari v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1999] F.C.J. No. 1703 (F.C.A.)(QL), the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed the appellant's argument that a bias or a reasonable apprehension of bias existed because the RPD had itself considered the issue of exclusion in the absence of the Minister. In that case, the appellant also argued that in doing so, the RPD compromised the non-adversarial nature of the proceeding before it.
