  The transcript shows that the applicant did testify that such an offer was made to him but it appears that the RPD misconstrued the evidence as to when this offer was put forward. The applicant said that it was at the very beginning when the LTTE was trying to convince him to join as a soldier. The RPD misunderstood this to have happened somewhat later in the course of the applicant's relationship with the LTTE.
