  Mr. Nagamany is a 36-year-old Tamil from Jaffna, Sri Lanka. He claims that he fears persecution by the Sri Lankan authorities particularly the army, and by the LTTE. The Sri Lankan army would allegedly persecute him because of imputed political opinions, his alleged membership in the LTTE, his nationality and race (Tamil). The LTTE would also harm him, particularly because he identified two of its members while he was detained and tortured by the Sri Lankan army. This particular fact is not included in his PIF but it was raised during one of his three hearings.
