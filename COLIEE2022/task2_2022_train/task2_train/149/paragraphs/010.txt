  The RPD held three hearings in this case. The Minister was not represented and the matter of the exclusion was raised by the RPD during the first hearing after Mr. Nagamany had testified that he had worked many years for the LTTE. It was then decided that the merits of his claim would be reviewed during that hearing and the matter would be adjourned to give him time to prepare for a hearing on the exclusion (Section 98 of the Act which refers to subsection 1F of the Refugee Convention).
