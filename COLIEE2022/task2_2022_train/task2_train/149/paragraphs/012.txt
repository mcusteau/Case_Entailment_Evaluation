  Despite those important findings (five pages), the RPD does not come to any conclusion with respect to Mr. Nagamany's claim under sections 96 and 97 (inclusion). It did not reject his claim on the basis of non-credibility and the overall lack of credible evidence. Instead, the RPD proceeded to review the facts relevant to the exclusion and concluded that the claimant should be excluded because there were serious reasons for considering that he was complicit in the crimes against humanity committed by the LTTE.
