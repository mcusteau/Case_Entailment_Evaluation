  In my opinion, the situation here is analogous to the one considered by Prothonotary Morneau in  
 Engineering Dynamics Ltd. v. Joannou 
 , supra. I adopt, as well, the remarks of Justice Simpson in  
 Lawther v. 424470 B.C. Ltd. 
  (1995), 95 F.T.R. 81; 60 C.P.R.(3d) 510 (T.D.), at pages 511-12 [C.P.R.] as follows: 
 
 
 
 "In my view, the determination of this contractual issue will dictate ownership of the patent and the appropriate relief in respect of the patent. For this reason, I have concluded that this is primarily a case in contract and that the patent issues are ancillary. Accordingly, this court is without jurisdiction. The plaintiff should pursue his right in the Supreme Court of British Columbia. As Mr. Justice Dub√© noted in  
 Laurin v. Champagne 
  (1991), 38 C.P.R.(3d) 193, at p. 196, 49 F.T.R. 280; 29 A.C.W.S.(3d) 538 (T.D.), the plaintiff may apply to this court in the future to vary the registration of the Assignment should such an application be required."
