 [35] 
  The Applicant is seeking a declaration of ownership of the patent. It claims to be the owner of the patent but can only refer to a series of contracts in support of its claim. It is necessary for a court to interpret those contracts to determine if indeed the Applicant acquired ownership of the patent in issue. This Court has no inherent jurisdiction to adjudicate upon private contracts which are not otherwise within its jurisdiction.
