 "2. There must be an existing body of federal law which is essential to the disposition of the case and which nourishes the statutory grant of jurisdiction. 
 
 
 
 "3. The law on which the case is based must be 'a law of Canada' as the phrase is used in section 101 of the  
 Constitution Act, 1867 
 ."
