  In late 1990 or early 1991, the Toronto Dominion Bank discovered that a second Nor-Equip Company had been established. That bank then sent out notices to the creditors of Nor-Equip to pay the bank directly, as it assumed that the assets of Nor-Equip had been assigned to Nor-Equip (1990). Mr. Symes went to the Toronto Dominion Bank and gave his personal assurances that the Nor-Equip debt would be repaid. Then Mr. Symes commenced negotiations with the FBDB to try to effect a re-organization of the Nor-Equip companies. The business plan written by Mr. Symes states that Nor-Equip held patents on the Mill Hole and as a result, had no competition in this area. [see footnote 2]
