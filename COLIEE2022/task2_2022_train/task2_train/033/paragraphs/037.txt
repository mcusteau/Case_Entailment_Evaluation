 [37] 
  The Applicant's argument, in the present case, that this Court has the jurisdiction to determine priorities between competing claims to the 469 Patent is, in my opinion, misplaced and designed to distract attention from the primary issue which is ownership of the 469 Patent. The evidence is that the Respondent claims to be the owner of the Patent, not that it has a prior claim to it. The 469 Patent was assigned to the Respondent by Columbia in 1994 and the assigned was registered.
