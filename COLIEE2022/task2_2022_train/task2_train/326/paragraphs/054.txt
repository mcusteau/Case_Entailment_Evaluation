As for resolution 67, it may well be that setting it aside would have no immediate impact. I am not prepared, however, to say that the application for judicial review is futile and has no practical effect. If this were the case, it seems to me that it would not have been adopted as it was in an extraordinary manner in the midst of the political campaign. The newly elected officials will, in any event, have the task of determining if some of the Executive Committeeâ€™s acts may be challenged and whether it is worthwhile to do so in light of the advantages and disadvantages of lawsuits before a Court of law.
