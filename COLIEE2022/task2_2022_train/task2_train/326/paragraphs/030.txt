This classic approach seems, however, to have given way to the pragmatic and functional approach, which a majority of the Supreme Court now seems to favour in determining the standard of review applicable to decisions made by administrative bodies as well as those adopted by local authorities. Such is the result of the evolution of case law, which is revealed by the following judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada:
Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City)
, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 231; 163 N.R. 81; 41 B.C.A.C. 81; 66 W.A.C. 81;
Nanaimo (City) v. Rascal Trucking Ltd. et al.
, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 342; 251 N.R. 42; 132 B.C.A.C. 298; 215 W.A.C. 298; 2000 SCC 13;
Chamberlain et al. v. Board of Education of School District No. 36 (Surrey)
, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 710; 299 N.R. 1; 175 B.C.A.C. 161; 289 W.A.C. 161; 2002 SCC 86. In her book entitled
Vers la primauté de l’approche pragmatique et fonctionnelle
(Éd. Yvon Blais, Cowansville, 2003, at pages 107-125), Professor Suzanne Comtois did a very thorough and clear analysis of this evolution.
