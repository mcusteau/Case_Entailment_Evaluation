Citing the preliminary statement of s. 2(3): "
Unless the context otherwise requires
or this Act otherwise provides", the respondents argued that the context could allow a deviation from the rule under paragraph 2(3)(b). However, I have great difficulty in interpreting those words as referring to a custom and even greater difficulty in reading therein, on the basis of this custom, an implicit authorization to deviate from the clear language of the above-stated provision. It appears to me that, if it had wanted to authorize the application of a custom to set aside the provisions of paragraph 2(3)(b), Parliament would have said so much more directly, as was the case when it allowed the election of a band council through custom rather than pursuant to the requirements of s. 74.
