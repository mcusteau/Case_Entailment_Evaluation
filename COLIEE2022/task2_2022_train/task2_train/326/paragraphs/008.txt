On August 8, 2002, the I.T.U.M. Council decided to extend the contracts of the contract workers until December 31, 2004, in order to ensure a smoother transition following the elections. The Council resolution therefore expressly authorized Chief Rosario Pinette to amend the contract term and remuneration (Resolution 02-03-40; applicantâ€™s record, at page 77).
