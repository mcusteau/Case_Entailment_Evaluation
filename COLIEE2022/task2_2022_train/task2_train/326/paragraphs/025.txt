It is now settled law that decisions taken by a band council, when it exercises, or is deemed to exercise, its power to govern the band may be judicially reviewed by the Federal Court. The case law is replete with decisions holding that a band council is, for purposes of s. 18 of the
Federal Courts Act
, "a federal board, commission or other tribunal:" see, inter alia,
Rider v. Ear
(1979), 103 D.L.R.(3d) 168 (Alta. T.D.);
Canatonquin et al. v. Gabriel et al.
, [1980] 2 F.C. 792; [1981] 4 C.N.L.R. 61 (F.C.A.);
Coalition To Save Northern Flood v. Canada et al.
, [1995] 9 W.W.R. 457; 102 Man.R.(2d) 223; 93 W.A.C. 223 (C.A.). This is true not only when a council exercises the power it was explicitly granted by a federal statute, but also when the contested decision is based on a custom; this is so simply because it is the
Indian Act
itself, more specifically s. 2(1) of the
Act
, that recognizes the legal character of the custom: see
Francis et al. v. Mohawk Council of Kanesatake et al.
, [2003] 4 F.C. 1133; 227 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.), at paragraphs 13-17;
Conatonquin v. Gabriel
, supra;
Frank v. Bottle et al.
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 670; 65 F.T.R. 89 (T.D.);
Scrimbitt v. Sakimay Indian Band Council
, [2000] 1 F.C. 513; 178 F.T.R. 210 (T.D.). Therefore, resolutions of a band council are considered decisions under the
Federal Courts Act
and may be subject to judicial review.
