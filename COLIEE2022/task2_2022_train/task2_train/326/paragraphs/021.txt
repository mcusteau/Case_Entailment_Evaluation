The creation of the Executive Committee, however, did not go smoothly. Indeed, in September 2004, two members of the Uashat Mak Mani-Utenam Community submitted before a public meeting of the Council a petition signed by almost 38% of the Community electors, in which they alleged that there had been an illegal delegation of the I.T.U.M. Council’s powers to an Executive Committee that included non-Innus; the petition also requested the holding of a general meeting. However, as the petition’s instigator failed to do any follow-up, the petition fell through. The respondents, incidentally, expressed doubts regarding the authenticity and validity of this petition.
