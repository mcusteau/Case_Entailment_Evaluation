The powers granted to band councils under the
Indian Act
more closely resemble the powers of municipal councils than those possessed by the board of directors of a business corporation:
Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band et al.
, [2000] 1 F.C. 325; 243 N.R. 302 (F.C.A.);
Francis et al. v. Mohawk Council of Kanesatake et al.
, [2003] 4 F.C. 1133; 227 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.);
Leonard v. Gottfriedson
(1980), 21 B.C.L.R. 326 (S.C.);
Isolation Sept-Iles v. Bande des Montagnais de Sept-Iles et Maliotenam
(1989), 2 C.N.L.R. 49 (Que. S.C.). In this perspective, it might appear that the determination of the explicit or implicit limits of the discretionary power possessed by a band council is judicially reviewable according to the ultra vires doctrine:
