There is no dispute that the councillors representing the opposition, namely the applicant, along with Brigitte André and Réjean Ambroise, were not contacted by the I.T.U.M. Council secretary to sign resolution 64. In addition, the evidence shows that the councillors who signed resolution 64 were under the impression that the compensation paid to Konrad Sioui was already included in his employment contract. In fact, most of them were unaware that the law firm of Bertrand Poulin had been retained several months before to draft a new employment contract for Konrad Sioui and to prepare resolution 64. They were also unaware of the compensation amount to be paid to Mr. Sioui.
