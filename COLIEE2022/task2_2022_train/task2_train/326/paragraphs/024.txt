[24]
The applicant and the respondents raised before this Court several issues in relation to this case. After having reviewed the record as well as the written and oral arguments of the parties, I came to the conclusion that I needed to address the following points in order to dispose of these applications for judicial review:
- What is the applicable standard of review?
- Were resolutions 64 and 67 validly adopted? More specifically, could these resolutions be adopted without a Council meeting, by distributing them to the members until a majority was reached? Is this the kind of procedure that evolved as a custom within the I.T.U.M. Council?
- Even assuming that these customs were not validly adopted, should this Court refuse to intervene on the grounds that the community did not suffer any damage?
