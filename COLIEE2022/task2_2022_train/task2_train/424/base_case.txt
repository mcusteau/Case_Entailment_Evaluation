Dawson, J.
: In this application for judicial review Mr. Esteban challenges the decision of the Registrar of the Immigration Appeal Division ("IAD") discontinuing Mr. Esteban's pending appeal to the IAD as a result of the application of s. 196 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 ( the "
IRAP
").
Background Facts
[2]
Mr. Esteban is a permanent resident of Canada who, since 1990, has been convicted of five criminal offenses in Canada. The most recent and serious conviction was entered in January of 2001 when Mr. Esteban pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to traffic cocaine under s. 465(1)(c) of the
Criminal Code
. As a result, in February of 2001 Mr. Esteban was sentenced to a four-year term of imprisonment.
[3]
In consequence of that conviction, on April 27, 2001 Mr. Esteban was reported for inquiry pursuant to s. 27(1)(d) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 ("former
Act
"). On August 3, 2001, he was then directed to inquiry pursuant to s. 27(3) of the former
Act
. On December 9, 2001, a delegate of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration formed the opinion, pursuant to s. 70(5) of the former
Act
, that Mr. Esteban is a danger to Canada. An application for leave and judicial review was filed in respect of that decision.
[4]
A senior immigration officer gave Mr. Esteban notice of his immigration inquiry and on January 16, 2002 Mr. Esteban was ordered by an adjudicator to be deported. Mr. Esteban provided a notice of appeal of the removal order at the end of the hearing, as required. The notice of appeal was accepted by the IAD on a without prejudice basis in view of the existence of the danger opinion. This was because s. 70(5)(c) of the former
Act
precluded an appeal to the IAD by a person described in s. 27(1)(d) of the former
Act
where the person was the subject of a danger opinion. However, Mr. Esteban was challenging the validity of the danger opinion.
[5]
On June 28, 2002, the
IRAP
was proclaimed. On August 23, 2002, Mr. Esteban's application for judicial review of the ministerial danger opinion was allowed by the Court on consent of the respondent.
[6]
Thereafter, the following occurred. On August 26, 2002, the IAD advised Mr. Esteban that his appeal of the deportation order was discontinued as a result of the existence of the danger opinion issued pursuant to s. 70(5) of the former
Act
, and the application of s. 64(1) of the
IRAP
and s. 326(2) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227. The IAD appears to have resiled from that position upon being advised that the danger opinion had been quashed by the Court before the decision of the IAD. Following this, on August 30, 2002 a hearings officer at Citizenship and Immigration Canada in Winnipeg wrote to the Registrar of the IAD, drawing attention to the four-year sentence imposed upon Mr. Esteban as a result of his criminal conviction. The hearings officer requested that the IAD discontinue Mr. Esteban's appeal pursuant to ss. 64 and 196 of the
IRAP
. Without waiting for responsive submissions on Mr. Esteban's behalf, on September 6, 2002 the Registrar of the IAD wrote to Mr. Esteban advising that his appeal had been discontinued as a result of the application of ss. 64 and 196 of the
IRAP
. This application for judicial review is in respect of that decision.
The Issue
[7]
Mr. Esteban raises a number of issues on this application. First, he argues that the IAD incorrectly interpreted the relevant provisions of the
IRAP
. Second, Mr. Esteban asserts that in the circumstances of this case, s. 196 of the
IRAP
and the declining of jurisdiction by the IAD violate sections 7, 12 and 15 of the
Canadian Charte
r of Rights and Freedoms
("
Charter
"). He also asserts violations of the principles of fundamental justice, particularly on the basis of retroactivity, delay, removal of vested rights, and removal of appeal without substitution of another avenue of recourse.
[8]
On the view I take of this matter, the determinative issue is the proper interpretation of s. 196 of the
IRAP
. It is therefore not necessary for me to consider the arguments advanced on Mr. Esteban's behalf with respect to the
Charter
and fundamental justice.
Analysis
[9]
The sections of the
IRAP
, in my view, relevant to the proper interpretation of s. 196 are ss. 36, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 192, 196, and 197. Also relevant are s. 49(1)(b), s. 73(1), and s. 74 of the former
Act
. All of these sections are appended to these reasons in Appendix A.
[10]
Briefly, s. 36(1) of the
IRAP
reflects Parliament's intent, at least when the
IRAP
is fully applicable to pending proceedings and the transitional provisions are spent, that permanent residents are inadmissible to Canada on grounds of serious criminality. Section 62 of the
IRAP
constitutes the IAD as the competent division of the Immigration and Refugee Board with respect to appeals under Division 7 of Part I of the
IRAP
. Its jurisdiction with respect to those appeals is set forth in s. 66 of the
IRAP
, which allows the IAD, after considering an appeal: to allow the appeal in accordance with s. 67; to dismiss the appeal in accordance with s. 69; or to stay a removal order under appeal in accordance with s. 68 of the
IRAP
.
[11]
Notwithstanding that general grant of jurisdiction, s. 64(1) of the
IRAP
is express that no appeal may be made to the IAD by a permanent resident if the permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on certain grounds, including serious criminality. For the purpose of s. 64(1) and the loss of appeal rights, serious criminality must be with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by term of imprisonment of at least two years. See: s. 64(2).
[12]
Relevant transitional provisions are found in ss. 192, 196 and 197 of the
IRAP
. Because of their importance to this analysis, they are set out here for ease of reference:
"192. If a notice of appeal has been filed with the Immigration Appeal Division immediately before the coming into force of this section, the appeal shall be continued under the former Act by the Immigration Appeal Division of the Board.
[. . . . .]
"196. Despite section 192, an appeal made to the Immigration Appeal Division before the coming into force of this section shall be discontinued if the appellant has not been granted a stay under the former Act and the appeal could not have been made because of section 64 of this Act.
"197. Despite section 192, if an appellant who has been granted a stay under the former Act breaches a condition of the stay, the appellant shall be subject to the provisions of section 64 and s. 68(4) of this Act."
"192. S'il y a eu dépôt d'une demande d'appel à la Section d'appel de l'immigration, à l'entrée en vigueur du présent article, l'appel est continué sous le régime de l'ancienne loi, par la Section d'appel de l'immigration de la Commission.
[. . . . .]
"196. Malgré l'article 192, il est mis fin à l'affaire portée en appel devant la Section d'appel de l'immigration si l'intéressé est, alors qu'il ne fait pas l'objet d'un sursis au titre de l'ancienne loi, visé par la restriction du droit d'appel prévue par l'article 64 de la présente loi.
"197. Malgré l'article 192, l'intéressé qui fait l'objet d'un sursis au titre de l'ancienne loi et qui n'a pas respecté les conditions du sursis, est assujetti à la restriction du droit d'appel prévue par l'article 64 de la présente loi, le paragraphe 68(4) lui étant par ailleurs applicable."
[13]
The gist of the dispute between the parties in this application is the proper interpretation to be given the phrase "granted a stay under the former Act" contained in s. 196. The Minister states that the phrase only refers to stays granted by the IAD under s. 73 of the former
Act
, and does not include a statutory stay arising automatically by operation of s. 49(1)(b) of the former
Act
. Mr. Esteban states that the phrase includes that statutory stay. [see footnote 1]
[14]
It is conceded in the present case that Mr. Esteban is precluded by s. 64 of the
IRAP
from making any appeal to the IAD. Hence, the transition provision found in s. 196 of the
IRAP
will apply to him so as to discontinue any pending appeal unless the statutory stay he was entitled to under the former
Act
is a stay "granted" under the former
Act
within the contemplation of s. 196.
[15]
The relevant transitional provisions, including s. 196, have been the subject of interpretation by this Court.
[16]
In
Medovarski v. Canada (Ministre de la Citoyenneté et de l'Immigration)
(2003), 234 F.T.R. 101 (T.D.), 2003 FCT 634, Madam Justice Snider concluded that the word "stay" found in section 196 of the
IRAP
does contemplate a statutory stay that came into effect as a result of the operation of paragraph 49(1)(b) of the former
Act
(see particularly paragraph 48 of her reasons). Justice Snider's analysis was adopted by Mr. Justice Campbell in
Jones v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 518 (T.D.), 2003 FCT 661 and
Amado-Cordeiro v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2003), 236 F.T.R. 193 (T.D.), 2003 FC 847. A similar conclusion was reached by Madam Justice Heneghan in
Cartwright v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2003), 236 F.T.R. 98 (T.D.), 2003 FCT 792 on the basis of a separate analysis (see paragraphs 72 through 87 of the reasons).
[17]
A contrary result was, however, reached by Mr. Justice Blais in
Nokhodchari v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2003), 236 F.T.R. 206 (T.D.), 2003 FCT 803. There, Mr. Justice Blais appears to have distinguished
Medovarski
on the facts before him (see particularly paragraphs 11, 22, 23 and 30).
[18]
Before me, counsel for the Minister urged that comity does not require me to follow the decision in
Medovarski
because it is "manifestly wrong". The force of that submission is no doubt weakened by the fact that the same conclusion was reached by Justices Campbell and Heneghan. I do not believe that the decisions in
Medovarski
and
Cartwright
are "manifestly wrong". Nor am I, with respect, prepared to distinguish those cases, as sought by the Minister, on the basis of the behaviour of the parties in the case at bar. I am not satisfied that in this case a different result should be reached just because a hearing date for the appeal had not been set or because the parties were uncertain as to whether the appeal would continue under the
IRAP
.
[19]
Moreover, if the question before me was a matter of first impression, I would conclude that the IAD erred in its interpretation of s. 196 of the
IRAP
.
[20]
Section 192 is the general transitional provision applicable to appeals pending before the IAD when the
IRAP
came into force. This section acts generally to continue under the former
Act
appeals before the IAD which were commenced under the former
Act
. Counsel for the Minister agreed that s. 192 applies to appeals which had been commenced by the filing of a notice of appeal and which had not yet been disposed of by the IAD. This intent is reflected by the language in s. 192 which refers to the filing of a notice of appeal.
[21]
It seems to me that an appeal may be pending, but not disposed of by the IAD, in one of two circumstances. First, a notice of appeal may have been filed but the appeal not yet adjudicated upon by the IAD. Second, the appeal may have been filed and adjudicated, but remained pending because the IAD had stayed the removal order rather than dismissing or allowing the appeal. The IAD thus remained seized of the proceeding in the sense that the IAD would review the case from time to time as contemplated by ss. 74(2) and 74(3) of the former
Act
.
[22]
Turning then to section 196, this provision limits the general principle found in section 192 continuing appeal proceedings. The Minister argues that the general provision is limited by s. 196 so that only where the IAD had granted a stay under the former
Act
does an appeal continue. This submission therefore requires consideration of the jurisdiction of the IAD under the former
Act
to grant a stay.
[23]
That jurisdiction was contained in s. 73(1) of the former
Act
. Section 73(1) provided that on an appeal brought by a permanent resident against a removal order the IAD "may dispose of" the appeal by allowing it, dismissing it, or by directing that execution of the removal order be stayed. The IAD was given no jurisdiction to issue a stay on an interim basis before a pending appeal was disposed of. A stay could only be ordered by the IAD when disposing of an appeal before it.
[24]
It follows that if the Minister's argument is correct, where a person appeals a removal order under the former
Act
as a result of being sentenced to a term of imprisonment of at least two years, there would be no circumstance where an appeal filed but not disposed of by the IAD could be continued under the
IRAP
. This is because there would be no circumstance where the IAD could have "granted a stay under the former
Act
" before hearing the appeal.
[25]
Put another way, pursuant to s. 192 of the
IRAP
appeals filed under the former
Act
generally are continued and proceed under the former
Act
. Under the former
Act
once an appeal was filed it remained in effect until it was "disposed" of by the IAD in one of three ways. To the extent that s. 196 refers to appeals being "discontinued", this contemplates that the appeal had not yet been disposed of by the IAD. However, under the former
Act
a stay could not have been granted by the IAD while the appeal was pending, but not yet disposed of.
[26]
Parliament could have enacted a provision whereby all appeals pending before the IAD upon the coming into force of the
IRAP
were terminated where the appeal was brought in respect of a removal order based upon the imposition of a term of imprisonment of at least two years. However, that is not what s. 196 of the
IRAP
contemplates because it specifically envisages that in at least some circumstances a granted stay would be in existence so as to allow the appeal to continue.
[27]
Section 196, in my respectful view, therefore only has any meaning if it contemplates a statutory stay. As Madam Justice Heneghan succinctly observed in
Cartwright
, supra, at paragraph 81:
"[...] if Parliament had wanted s. 196 to apply only to those people with outstanding appeals who actually had stays 'granted' under the former
Act
, then there must have been some provision in the former
Act
for some Applicants to receive such 'granted stays'."
[28]
Further, ss. 196 and 197 of the
IRAP
should be read together because they both limit the general provision in s. 192 continuing appeals under the former
Act
. Returning to the point that an appeal to the IAD may remain pending in two circumstances, it seems to me that Parliament intended that s. 196 and s. 197 each deal with one of those two circumstances. Section 196 applies to appeals launched but not heard or disposed of, while s. 197 applies to appeals heard but still extant because a stay was issued by the IAD.
[29]
The Minister did not argue that s. 196 contemplates judicial stays. In any event,
FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED reflected the view of this Court under the former
Act
that where a statutory stay was in effect, there was no need for the Court to grant a discretionary stay and the Court would decline to do so. Similarly, a number of judges of this Court declined to issue judicial stays where statutory stays were held to exist in the context of subparagraph 49(1)(c)(i) of the former
Act
. See for example,
Ziyadah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 4 F.C. 152 (T.D.) and
Kockovski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2000), 6 Imm. L.R. (3rd) 242 and the authorities reviewed therein by Mr. Justice Blais. The effect of the jurisprudence is that where a person was entitled to the benefit of a statutory stay, a judicial stay was likely not available.
[30]
This analysis, in my view, interprets s. 196 of the
IRAP
on the basis of the ordinary meaning of the words used, and on the basis of reading section 196 in its entire context, harmoniously, with the scheme and object of the
IRAP
and the intention of Parliament. The interpretation that s. 196 contemplates a statutory stay avoids the result that there would never be a "granted" stay in respect of an appeal pending with the IAD, but not heard. Under this interpretation there are some cases where s. 196 of the
Act
would operate to remove an appeal pending to the IAD. This was discussed by Madam Justice Snider at paragraphs 43 and 44 in
Medovarski
, supra.
[31]
It follows that I conclude that the Registrar erred by concluding that Mr. Esteban's appeal was discontinued, and that such decision should be set aside.
[32]
Counsel agreed that I should certify the same question as certified by the Court in
Medovarski
.
ORDER
[33]
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:
1. The application for judicial review is allowed, and the decision of the Registrar of the Immigration Appeal Division made on September 6, 2002 accepting that the applicant's appeal had been discontinued is hereby set aside.
2. The following question is certified:
Does the word "stay" in section 196 of the
IRAP
contemplate a stay that came into effect under the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 as a result of the operation of paragraph 49(1)(b)?
Application allowed.

Footnotes
1. Under s. 49(1)(b) of the former
Act
, a deportation order was statutorily stayed where an appeal was filed with the IAD until either the appeal was heard and disposed of, or the IAD declared the appeal to be abandoned. In
Solis v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] 2 F.C. 693; 127 F.T.R. 218 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Gibson concluded that while the issuance of a danger opinion might in some sense dispose of an appeal, the statutory language was conjunctive with respect to the hearing and disposition of the appeal. He concluded that s. 49(1)(b) of the former
Act
required that an appeal be both heard and disposed of before the stay expired. Accordingly, the issuance of a danger opinion did not vitiate a statutory stay unless or until the appeal was heard, or was declared abandoned by the IAD.
In the present case, Mr. Esteban's appeal was neither heard nor declared abandoned as a result of the issuance of the danger opinion while the danger opinion was in effect. By application of the principle articulated in
Solis
, Mr. Esteban was therefore entitled to have his removal statutorily stayed under the former
Act
as a result of the appeal he had filed with the IAD.

67(2) La décision attaquée est cassée; y est substituée celle, accompagnée, le cas échéant, d'une mesure de renvoi, qui aurait dû être rendue, ou l'affaire est renvoyée devant l'instance compétente.
68(1) Il est sursis à la mesure de renvoi sur preuve qu'il y a - compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché - des motifs d'ordre humanitaire justifiant, vu les autres circonstances de l'affaire, la prise de mesures spéciales.
68(2) La section impose les conditions prévues par règlement et celles qu'elle estime indiquées, celles imposées par la Section de l'immigration étant alors annulées; les conditions non réglementaires peuvent être modifiées ou levées; le sursis est révocable d'office ou sur demande.
68(3) Par la suite, l'appel peut, sur demande ou d'office, être repris et il en est disposé au titre de la présente section.
68(4) Le sursis de la mesure de renvoi pour interdiction de territoire pour grande criminalité ou criminalité est révoqué de plein droit si le résident permanent ou l'étranger est reconnu coupable d'une autre infraction mentionnée au paragraphe 36(1), l'appel étant dès lors classé.
69(1) L'appel est rejeté s'il n'y est pas fait droit ou si le sursis n'est pas prononcé.
69(2) L'appel du ministre contre un résident permanent ou une personne protégée non visée par le paragraphe 64(1) peut être rejeté ou la mesure de renvoi applicable, assortie d'un sursis, peut être prise, même si les motifs visés aux alinéas 67(1)a) ou b) sont établis, sur preuve qu'il y a - compte tenu de l'intérêt supérieur de l'enfant directement touché - des motifs d'ordre humanitaire justifiant, vu les autres circonstances de l'affaire, la prise de mesures spéciales.
69(3) Si elle rejette l'appel formé au titre du paragraphe 63(4), la section prend une mesure de renvoi contre le résident permanent en cause qui se trouve au Canada.
