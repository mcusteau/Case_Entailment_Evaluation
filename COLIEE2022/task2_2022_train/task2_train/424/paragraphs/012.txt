supports the proposition that, because the issuance of a "danger to the public" opinion terminates the Appeal Division's jurisdiction to entertain an appeal, s. 49(1)(b) cannot apply to continue a stay in favour of the applicant. He submits that the appeal that existed before the Appeal Division prior to the issuance of "the danger to the public" opinion no longer exists and the Appeal Division cannot hear and, dispose of, or declare abandoned, the applicant's appeal. To decide otherwise would be to grant an indefinite stay as the appeal could never be heard and, disposed of or declared abandoned as the Appeal Division is without jurisdiction to do so.
