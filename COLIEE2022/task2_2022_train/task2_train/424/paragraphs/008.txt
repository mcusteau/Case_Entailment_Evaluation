I concluded that the applicant's application for a discretionary stay, pursuant to s. 18.2 of the
Federal Court Act
should be dismissed on the basis that there already exists a statutory stay pursuant to s. 49(1)(b) of the
Act
. Alternatively, I was satisfied that the applicant had failed to establish that he would face irreparable harm should he be deported to Guatemala and that the balance of convenience was in his favour.
