In
Tsang
, the Court of Appeal was faced with the interpretation of s. 15(3) of
An Act to Amend the Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act
and to make a Consequential Amendment to the Customs Act
, S.C. 1995, c. 15, (in force, July 10, 1995.) ("Bill C-44"), being a transitional provision for "danger to the public" opinions under s. 77(3) of the
Act
. The certified question before the court was as follows:
"When an appeal is made by a sponsor to the Immigration Appeal Division ('IAD') prior to July 10, 1995, with respect to a sponsoree who is inadmissible pursuant to s. 19(1)(c), (c. 1), (c. 2) or (d) of the
Immigration Act
, and the hearing before the IAD has commenced after July 10, 1995, does the effect of the Minister issuing a 'danger to the public' opinion extinguish the sponsor's right of appeal pursuant to s. 77(3) of the
Act
and s. 15(3) of Bill C-44 and thereby terminate the jurisdiction of the IAD with respect to the appeal?"
Marceau, J.A., writing for the court, on the basis of his interpretation of s. 15(3), answered the above question in the affirmative. The implication of this holding is that the issuance of a "danger to the public" opinion terminates the jurisdiction of the Appeal Division, at least in the circumstances there under consideration.
