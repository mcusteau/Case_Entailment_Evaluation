The language of the opening words of s. 49(1) and paragraph (b) of that subsection is clear. Where an appeal has been filed with the Appeal Division, the deportation order is stayed until either: 1) the appeal is heard and disposed of; or 2) the Appeal Division declares that the appeal has been abandoned. Neither of these conditions has been fulfilled. It is arguable that the issuance of the "danger to the public" opinion, insofar as it terminates the Appeal Division's jurisdiction, "disposes" of the appeal. However, the statutory language is conjunctive with respect to the hearing and disposition of the appeal; it requires both that the appeal be "heard"
and
that the appeal be "disposed of." In this case the appeal certainly was not "heard". Therefore, whether or not it has been "disposed of", by reason of the decision in
Tsang
, is not dispositive. In the result, the statutory stay remains in effect.
