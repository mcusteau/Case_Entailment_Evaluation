I am satisfied that the same can be said with regard to adverse effects on rights of long-term residents of Canada, such as the applicant. Equally, I am satisfied that the passage applies to failure to truncate rights where that failure may have been legislatively accidental or a mere oversight. Here, there can be no question that the respondent would have the court truncate a clear and unequivocal right, the right not to have an outstanding removal order executed where an appeal from the removal order to the Appeal Division has been filed, absent very specific statutory conditions. I am satisfied that that right has not been specifically truncated where it was undeniably open to the legislature to do so.
