  Furthermore, section 87.3 of the Act provides for the issuance of Ministerial Instructions by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. The Ministerial Instructions, which were applicable to Federal Skilled Workers when the applicant applied for permanent residence, are entitled "MI1" (Ministerial Instructions, (2008) C Gaz I, 3043). They were applicable to applications received between February 27, 2008 and June 26, 2010. According to the MI1, applicants had to meet the requirements set forth under the instructions before being eligible for processing. Specifically, applicants had to have secured an Arranged Employment Offer (AEO) or have at least one (1) year of continuous full-time paid work experience over the last ten (10) years in one of the specified occupations set out by the NOC and listed in the Ministerial Instructions. Having no AEO, the applicant in the present case had to demonstrate that he had at least one (1) year of continuous full-time paid work experience in a listed NOC code during the ten (10) preceding years for his application to be eligible for processing.
