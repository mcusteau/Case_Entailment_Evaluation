 [10] 
  After considering both parties' proposed issues for this application for judicial review, the Court is of the view that the issues are as follows: 
 
 
 
 a. Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness by not giving the applicant the opportunity to address his doubts about the evidence being falsified? 
 
 
 
 b. Did the Officer err in deciding that the applicant's permanent residence application was ineligible for processing?
