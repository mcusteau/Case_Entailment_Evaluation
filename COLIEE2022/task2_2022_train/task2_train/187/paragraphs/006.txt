  The Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes indicate that the applicant had, at a preliminary stage, sufficient points to meet the requirements of the Act, having accumulated a total of sixty-nine (69) points while the required amount is sixty-seven (67). Of the applicant's sixty-nine (69) points, twenty-one (21) were provisionally awarded for work experience based on the applicant's submissions (Tribunal Record, p 7). However, upon review by the Officer, the documents supporting the applicant's work experience were rejected and his application was therefore deemed ineligible for processing.
