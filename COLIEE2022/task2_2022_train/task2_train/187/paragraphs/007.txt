  The Officer found the letter submitted by the applicant from Cirico describing his duties as a Construction Project Manager since February 2004 was not credible and was likely fabricated for immigration purposes (Tribunal Record, pp 7 and 72). The letter listed tasks which appeared to be copied directly from the NOC code 0711 and slightly modified. The company's letterhead and the business card attached to the letter were printed using an ink-jet printer. Furthermore, the Officer found it improbable that the applicant would be hired as a Construction Project Manager when he had no previous experience or training in the construction industry.
