 [27] 
  Finally, the applicant relies on the case of  
 Patel v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 571 at paras 21-27, [2011] FCJ No 714 (QL) [ 
 Patel 
 ], to support his argument that when the concern relates to the veracity (authenticity) of a document, as opposed to its sufficiency, an officer is obligated to inform an applicant of any concerns. In  
 Patel 
 , the officer was concerned about the veracity of the letter because the duties appeared to be copied directly from the NOC descriptions. The Court held that it was an error not to inform the applicant of such doubts on the credibility of the submitted documents and set aside the officer's decision for breach of procedural fairness. However, the  
 Patel 
  decision is distinguishable from the present case. Indeed, in  
 Patel 
 , the Court found that the officer's reasons were inadequate ( 
 Patel 
 , para 26). On the basis of the evidence on record, the Court is of the view that the Officer's reasons are adequate, as they explicitly make reference to the issue of "credibility and fabrication for immigration purposes".
