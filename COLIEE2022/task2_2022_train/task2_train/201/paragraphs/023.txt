  The applicant freely admits that cultural shame forced her to leave Viasna with her mother and to sever all contact with her family. In the letter to Viasna, the officer wrote that "your mother abandoned you in 1991 and left Cambodia in 2004 and made a conscious decision to leave you behind because you were born out of wedlock and also likely due to your visual disability; blind in one eye."
