  On June 21, 2010, a little less than three months later, leave to file the application for judicial review was granted by a judge of the Court. There was no specific finding in the order for leave regarding the application for an extension of time. Nothing special happened in the meantime, and it seemed that the motion to amend had even been forgotten. On September 16, 2010, the application for judicial review was heard by my colleague, Mr. Justice Yvon Pinard. However, before disposing of the matter on the merits, Justice Pinard raised the issue of the extension of time "because if the extension was going to be refused, this would necessarily result in the dismissal of the application for judicial review itself":
