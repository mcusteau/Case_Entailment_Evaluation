  The Commission submits that the inquiry into whether an employee's usefulness to the public service could be impaired is forward looking. Accordingly, it is not relevant what an employee has done in the past, but rather what she may be required to do in her position in the future. In its view, the information provided by the applicant's superior which indicated that the applicant could be required to act as lead counsel in important, complex or politically sensitive prosecutions was sufficient to conclude that she occupies a position with significant public visibility.
