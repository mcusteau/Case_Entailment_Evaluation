  I have reviewed both the recommendation that formed the basis of the Commission's decision as well as the information that was provided by the Department of Justice to the Commission respecting the applicant's responsibilities. In my view, the Commission's reasons cannot stand up to a somewhat probing examination and are not tenable based on the evidence. Its decision, therefore, is unreasonable.
