  During the months of February and March, there were several other correspondences among the applicant, the Department of Justice and the Commission. On February 18, 2004, a Commission staff member e-mailed the applicant's superior to request clarification regarding some of the responsibilities listed in the applicant's job description. In particular, the staff member asked what authority the applicant had over agents, if she made decisions as to whether to proceed with a prosecution and whether she was involved in complex, important or politically sensitive prosecutions. In his response, the superior indicated that the applicant did not have the authority to hire or fire agents, but that she did make decisions as to whether to proceed with prosecutions and that she  
 could 
  (emphasis added by the Court) be required to act as lead counsel in important, complex or politically sensitive prosecutions, although she had not done so to date.
