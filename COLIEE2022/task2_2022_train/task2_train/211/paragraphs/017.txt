  The test for mootness, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342; 92 N.R. 110; 75 Sask.R. 82, is two-fold. First, it is necessary to consider whether the required tangible and concrete dispute between the parties has disappeared. Second, even if the dispute has disappeared, the Court must decide whether to exercise its discretion to hear the case in any event.
