  In the present case, I accept that an adversarial context prevails. Both the Supreme Court and Federal Court of Appeal have held that an adversarial context exists where the case is vigorously and fully argued by the parties. See  
 New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. J.G. and D.V. 
 , [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46; 244 N.R. 276; 216 N.B.R.(2d) 25; 552 A.P.R. 25, and  
 Lavoie v. Canada (Minister of the Environment) 
  (2002), 291 N.R. 282 (F.C.A.). The parties in this application have maintained an adversarial stance and have argued their positions with determination, particularly the applicant. I would note, however, that in contrast to many of the decisions in which the Court has exercised its jurisdiction to hear a moot case, there are no collateral consequences that would affect the applicant in these circumstances.
