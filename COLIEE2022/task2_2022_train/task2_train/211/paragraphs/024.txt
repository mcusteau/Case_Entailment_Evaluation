  The third rationale identified in  
 Borowski 
 , supra, is the need for the Court to be aware of its proper law-making function relative to the legislature. In my view, it is not the proper role of this Court to render a decision that has no practical effect on the rights of the parties and that is purely academic in nature. See for example,  
 Moses v. Canada 
 , [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 948; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1835 (F.C. Protho.), at para. 20 and  
 Bago et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 744; [2004] F.C.J. No. 1565 (F.C.), at para. 15.
