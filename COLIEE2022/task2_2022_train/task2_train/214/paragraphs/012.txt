  The applicant has been released from immigration detention since October 28, 2003. Again, there is little information before the Court to explain the difference, if any, between the danger opinion and the decision by the Immigration Division to order the applicant's release, one presumably made under Division 6 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The Court acknowledges the time that has lapsed to complete this proceeding. The applicant's status in Canada now merits expeditious review by the respondent.
