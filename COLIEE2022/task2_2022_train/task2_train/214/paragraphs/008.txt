  It was incumbent on the minister's delegate to develop a clear, distinct and separate rationale and decision as to whether the applicant was a danger to the public in Canada. She was required to make this determination separate from and prior to any analysis of the risks which might result from his return to Sudan. In the circumstances of this proceeding, a discrete finding under ss. 115(2) that the applicant is a danger to the public in Canada must be made before the non-refoulement rights he may have under ss. 115(1) can be said not to apply to him. No such finding was made. Without such a finding, it was wrong for the Minister's delegate to embark on a balancing of danger factors against risk factors: see also Mahjoub v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 156 at paragraph 56.
