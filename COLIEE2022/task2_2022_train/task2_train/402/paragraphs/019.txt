I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, in respect of at least many of the sales of the Apple-compatible computers referred to above, the respondents sold them with infringing chips. There is evidence with respect to at least two computers purchased from Comtex while the injunction was in effect, namely Exhibits P-6 and P-52. Both of these were tested by Robert Martin, the expert witness called by the applicant, and he found these computers to contain infringing chips. The evidence showed that the computers had been bought from Comtex in this condition. The witness Harris, the respondents' former employee, testified that computers of the P-6 and P-52 variety and of the P-2 variety continued to be sold after the injunctions with ROM or equivalent chips included. He said he never saw one sold without such chips. He said that Comtex purchased blank EPROMs in quantity and most of these were sold with an Apple program on them. He said further that computers were tested before being delivered, and to test them it was necessary that such a chip be in place. While admittedly Harris is a disgruntled former employee who lost his job with Comtex, his evidence was generally corroborated by others. Three dealers, Mr. Tee, Mr. Gumley, and Mr. Brett all testified that they were supplied such computers by O.S. or Comtex during the period when the injunctions were in force, and that such computers contained ROM or EPROM chips. Mr. Tee and Mr. Gumley had received all Apple-compatible computers complete with chips, while most of those received by Mr. Brett had ROM or EPROM chips. That such chips were being supplied by Comtex is further corroborated by the fact that on the day when the search and seizure was carried out at its premises pursuant to the Anton Piller order, namely on March 31, 1987, the applicant's expert Mr. Martin tested chips and boards found in the premises. He found none usable in these machines which did not have the Apple program in them.
