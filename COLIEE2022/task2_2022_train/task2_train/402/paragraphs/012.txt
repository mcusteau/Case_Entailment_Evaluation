Since the hearing of this matter, and the drafting of the foregoing, I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of the Federal Court of Appeal in Bhatnager v. Minister of Employment and Immigration et al. (1988), 82 N.R. 360 (F.C.A.). The court in reversing my decision ([1986] 2 F.C. 3) held that knowledge of the order by, or proof of its service on, the lawyer for a party in a civil matter in the Federal Court is sufficient to fix that party with knowledge of the order for purposes of a subsequent prosecution for contempt of court. In other words, the requirements of service in a civil case suffice for imposing quasi-criminal responsibility for contempt on a party to the action. That case differed from the present case in that there was no basis there for me to infer from the circumstances actual knowledge by two federal ministers of an order made against them: only a limited interval intervened between the order and its violation as the order was issued on August 15, 1985 and compliance was in the circumstances required by August 26th; and there was no appeal or consent order where communication by the solicitor with the client could be presumed. Yet the Court of Appeal based its presumption of notice of the order on the fact that the solicitor of record for the ministers was aware of it. While in the present case I am satisfied that such knowledge can be presumed from the particular facts here, relying on the Bhatnager decision I can in any event base such a finding of knowledge by O.S. Micro Systems, Lami Yee Lam, and Jack Liu on the simple fact that their counsel was served with the orders and was otherwise aware of the appeal and the continuation of the interlocutory injunction.
