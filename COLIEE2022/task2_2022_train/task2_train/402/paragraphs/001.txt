Strayer, J.
: This is a proceeding under rule 355 by which the respondents were required by a show cause order to appear to hear proof against them with respect to an alleged contempt of court and to offer any defence that they might have. The respondents named in the show cause order include some of the defendants in the within action, and another person and other companies who are not defendants in that action. Those respondents who are defendants are O.S. Micro Systems Inc., Lami Lam, Jack Liu, Angel Li Lam and Minitronics of Canada Limited. The respondents who are not parties to this action include Comtex Micro System Inc., Jack Wu, Comtex Imports Co. Ltd., Concord Trading Ltd., and Our Star International Trading Co. Ltd. Concord Trading Ltd. was not represented before me and it was agreed on all sides that the British Columbia company which officially bears this name has nothing to do with this case, although it appears that some of the defendants have used the same name for the purposes of their business. No order will be made against Concord.
