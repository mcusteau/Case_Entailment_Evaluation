By agreement, the questions of penalties and costs are to be spoken to by counsel before a formal judgment is entered. I am postponing the making of an order with respect to penalties and costs in respect of Minitronics of Canada Limited and Angel Li Lam as well until after that hearing takes place.
Order accordingly.
