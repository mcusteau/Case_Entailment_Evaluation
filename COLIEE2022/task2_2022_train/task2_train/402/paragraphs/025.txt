It is true that no drawing or plan was put in evidence before me. However, it is not my role to adjudicate once again the matters decided by Walsh, J., when he issued the original injunction. Again, there can be no reasonable doubt among the parties as to what was meant by the wording of the injunction, particularly having regard to the evidence before Walsh, J., and the reasons given by him for his order. It was common ground that he had before him photographs of the computer which became Exhibit P-49 in the contempt hearing, together with expert evidence which satisfied him that there was a prima facie case that the applicant's design for the case had been infringed by the defendants in importing and selling computers such as P-49. It was on that basis that the injunction was issued and the defendants in that proceeding could have been under no illusion as to what design was prohibited. They and their associates who are among the respondents in the present proceeding must be taken to have shared this information. In the contempt hearing before me two further computers, P-6 and P-52, were put in as evidence and were proven to have been purchased from Comtex during the existence of the injunctions. I have compared those two computers with P-49, evidence as to which formed the basis for the order by Walsh, J. Careful visual examination of them satisfies me that they "appear to be" copies of the same design incorporated in P-49, albeit that the keyboards are somewhat different for functional reasons. In this latter respect, the injunction equally prohibits copies of "a substantial part" of the design or plans of the applicant. I am therefore satisfied that the injunction is sufficiently clear and that the respondents have committed contempt of court in respect of it with the sale of computers enclosed in such a case.
