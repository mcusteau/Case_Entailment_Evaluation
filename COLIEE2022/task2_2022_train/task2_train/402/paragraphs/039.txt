I have also given some weight to the fact that none of the individual respondents gave evidence. I believe there was a very substantial case for them to answer and they did not do so. Although this is a quasi-criminal matter I am entitled to take into account their failure to testify (see e.g. Steinberg v. R., [1931] O.R. 222 (Ont. C.A.), conf'd without reference to this point [1931] S.C.R. 421; R. v. MacLeod, [1968] 2 C.C.C. 365 (P.E.I. C.A.); Pratte v. Maher et al., [1965] 1 C.C.C. 77 (Que. C.A.); Re Tilco Plastics Ltd. v. Skurjat et al., [1967] 1 C.C.C. 131, at 158-159 (Ont. H.C.); Corbett v. R. (1973), 1 N.R. 258; 42 D.L.R.(3d) 142 (S.C.C.)) and I have done so.
