I have considered Jack Wu to bear somewhat less responsibility than the others in that his education in North America and his training and experience in business is obviously less than that of the others. The evidence at the show cause hearing also indicated that his role in the direction of business was somewhat less. Having regard to the limited maximum fine which I could impose, I was unable to order a lesser fine for him but have provided for a shorter sentence in default of payment.
