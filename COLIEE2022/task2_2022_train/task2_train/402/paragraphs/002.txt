At the beginning of the show cause hearing counsel appeared for Minitronics of Canada Limited and Angel Li Lam and advised me that his clients pleaded guilty to the allegations of contempt of court. A letter was submitted to the court from Angel Li Lam for himself and on behalf of Minitronics, of which he is an officer and director, admitting to certain breaches of an injunction issued by this court on November 14, 1985. He admitted to being aware of the injunction and that his actions constituted possible breaches of the injunction. He accepted responsibility for his actions and apologized without reservation to the court and to the plaintiff. After hearing argument on the subject I reserved my decision with respect to the appropriate punishment and with respect to costs in relation to these two respondents. As will be noted below, I will continue to reserve my decisions on these matters pending certain other developments.
