With respect to Minitronics of Canada Limited and Angel Li Lam, I took into account that, while by their own acknowledgement they had knowingly violated at least one of the injunctions, they admitted their guilt at the outset of the show cause hearing and apologized to the court in writing fully and without qualification. I further took into account that they had admitted to only two or three infringing sales and that no others were directly proven. Further, they stated that they had terminated all such sales by about the time the interlocutory injunction was issued. I therefore fined them only $1,000.00 each.
