This conclusion is in any event corroborated by evidence concerning the conduct of these respondents plus that of the other respondents in the present proceedings with whom they were associated. It must first be observed that the evidence shows that the allegedly contumacious conduct was carried on essentially by three individual respondents, Lami Yee Lam, Jack Liu, and Jack Wu, together with the companies O.S. Micro Systems Inc., and Comtex Micro System Inc. I am satisfied that the corporations in question were under the control of one or more of these individual respondents. There was ample evidence from those who dealt with or worked for O.S. and Comtex Micro System Inc. that these three individuals appeared to be jointly operating these businesses and were fully involved with their activities. It was not disputed that during the relevant period the two directors of O.S. Micro Systems Inc. were Lami Yee Lam and Jack Liu; and the directors of Comtex Micro Systems Inc. were Lami Yee Lam, Jack Liu, and Jack Wu. The evidence was far from clear on the role of Comtex Imports Co. Ltd. and none of the individual respondents are listed as directors of that company. Nor was it clear what distinct role, if any, Our Star International Trading Co. Ltd. played although Lami Yee Lam was a director of that company. As noted earlier, Concord Trading Ltd. as such is irrelevant to these proceedings.
