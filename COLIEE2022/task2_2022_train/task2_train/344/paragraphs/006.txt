I find it useful to refer to the text, by Gerald B. Robertson entitled Mental Disability and the Law in Canada which was cited to me [see footnote 3]. I adopt what that author said in speaking of clause 14(4)(f). He wrote: "It is important to note that the disqualification is not based on mental disability or capacity per se. Rather it is directed at two categories of people, those who have been restrained of their liberty of movement by reason of mental disease and those whose property is under the control of a committee of estate ... It does not follow that people who are declared incapable of managing their financial affairs are necessarily incapable of understanding the nature of the right to vote and of exercising it in a rational manner. It is simply a non sequitur to assume that psychiatric patients are necessarily incapable of voting. Indeed empirical research indicates that the voting pattern of psychiatric patients parallels that of the general population".
