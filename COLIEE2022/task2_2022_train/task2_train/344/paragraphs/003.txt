Section 1 of the Charter allows for limitations which are demonstrably justifiable in a free and democratic society. I have no doubt that one such limitation might be what I will call a requirement of mental competence or judgmental capacity. But, clause 14(4)(f) as presently drafted does not address itself only to mental competence or capacity insofar as that quality is required for the purposes of voting.
