  In Baker, the Supreme Court of Canada noted that in certain circumstances, the duty of procedural fairness requires the provisions of written reasons for a decision. This is especially so where, as in this case, the decision has important ramifications for the individual or individuals in question. According to the Court, "It would be unfair if the person subject to a decision such as this one which is so critical to their future not be told why the result was reached". (at para. 43).
