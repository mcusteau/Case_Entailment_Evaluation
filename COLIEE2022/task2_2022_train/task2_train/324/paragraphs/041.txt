The same can be said in this instance. In his submissions to the PRRA officer, counsel for the applicant referred to a number of media reports, to documents of Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, as well as to the Country of Origin Information Report on Sri Lanka from the UK Home Office. It is difficult to argue, in this context, that the applicant has not been treated fairly considering the circumstances of the case. He did make representations with respect to the evidence which affected the disposition of the case. Indeed, the UK Home Office Operational Guidance Note refers extensively on other public sources, first and foremost on country reports prepared by the Home Office. It cannot be said that this document was not available, could not be foreseen to be a source on which the officer would rely, and that it was so novel and significant that it evidenced changes in the country conditions which might have affected the decision. As a result of the foregoing, I would dismiss this argument.
