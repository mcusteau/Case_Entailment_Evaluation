Dr. Finegan concluded that:
"... he [Matthew] has relative strengths in social awareness and judgment. One of the most potent predictors of adjustment among people with intellectual disabilities is not IQ score, but social skills. Therefore, it can be predicted that Matthew will make fewer demands on the service delivery system than would his IQ-matched counterparts who have relatively poorer social skills.
Matthew no longer is under the care of physiotherapist, occupational therapists or speech pathologists, and at this stage of his life, it is not likely that these services would be reinstated.
"...
Matthew will place only those demands on educational, vocational and leisure services as would any well-adjusted individual with intellectual handicap to a mild degree, and he will require no extraordinary services. Given that Matthew will receive a pension from the Australian government, he will place fewer, if any, demands on the FBA ['Family Benefits Allowance'] system than would his Canadian counterparts.
