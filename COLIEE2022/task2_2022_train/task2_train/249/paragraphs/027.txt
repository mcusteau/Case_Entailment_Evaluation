[27]
In an even more recent decision of Mr. Justice Nadon in
Ludwig v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 111 F.T.R. 271; 33 Imm. L.R.(2d) 213 (T.D.), it was held that:
"It is clear from the foregoing jurisprudence that the reasonableness of the medical opinion may be an issue for the visa officer where on the evidence the opinion is or may be unreasonable."
Nadon, J., concluded that there was no reason for the visa officer to question the reasonableness of the opinion on the record before him, and, therefore, the visa officer's decision was reasonable. The issue, therefore, was whether there was anything before the visa officer that would cause the visa officer to question the reasonableness of the medical opinion based on the record before him.
