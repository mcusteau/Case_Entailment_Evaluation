The applicant's son was determined to be medically inadmissible pursuant to s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
which reads:
"19(1) No person shall be granted admission who is a member of any of the following classes:
(a) Persons who are suffering from any disease, disorder, disability or other health impairment as a result of the nature, severity or probable duration of which, in the opinion of a medical officer concurred in by at least one other medical officer,
. . . . .
(ii) their admission would cause or might reasonably be expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services;"
The above provision appears to require that only the medical officers make a determination about an immigration applicant's health status and whether that would cause or is reasonably expected to cause excessive demands on health or social services.
