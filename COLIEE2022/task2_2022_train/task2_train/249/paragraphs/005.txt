Matthew is eligible for a disability pension from the Australian government even if he resides outside of Australia. The amount of this pension is reduced by any amount of income that Matthew may receive. The current rate of support from this pension for a person aged 18-20 and living at home is $247.10 (Australian) per fortnight. For a person aged 21 and over, the rate is $348 (Australian) per fortnight. These rates include a pharmaceutical allowance of $5.40 (Australian) per fortnight, which would not be included in the payment should Matthew live permanently outside of Australia.
