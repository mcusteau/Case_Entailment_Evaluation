In my opinion, it would be a "win-win-win" situation if the applicant and his family were allowed to immigrate to Canada. The first "win" would be that Canada would be gaining two new professional, resourceful people: the applicant and his wife. The second "win" would be that, although the applicant's son, Matthew, has a mild mental disability, he would be accompanying his family as, by all accounts, a well-adjusted individual considering his circumstances, with an incredibly supportive family demonstrably capable of helping with his special needs. He would also be bringing with him an Australian disability pension as additional, extra-family support. The evidence of excessive demands on social services likely to be cause by this individual simply is not apparent from the record. The third "win" would be in furtherance of Canada's policy of family re-unification. The applicant, a former Canadian citizen, has an elderly mother in Canada who needs his help.
