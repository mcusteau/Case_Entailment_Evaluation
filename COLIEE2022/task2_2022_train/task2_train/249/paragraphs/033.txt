Dr. Grondin received the second psychological report from Dr. Rickard on January 23, 1996. However, this report was in respect of the assessment of Matthew that had been conducted on November 23, 1995. It was not a new assessment, as had been requested by Dr. Giovinazzo. Under the section entitled, "Assessment Comments and Summary," Dr. Rickard notes:
"Matthew's overall score on the WAIS-R at this time indicates that
his general ability/cognitive skills are within the Mildly Intellectually Disabled Range
.
"This would suggest that Matthew's rate of learning will be extremely slow and that his understanding of himself and his environment will be at a very literal and simple level. However, Matthew can and will continue to learn, especially if he is given guidance and support and encouragement and if there is an opportunity in the educational or work environment for him to use rehearsal and repetition to become proficient at tasks."
