I note that the medical officer, Dr. Grondin, had information from the Government of Ontario, Ministry of Community and Social Services, regarding the province-wide cost for services for adult disabled individuals. These costs ranged from, in the instance of a Life Skills Day Programme, $42/day for a lower needs person to $99/day for a higher needs adult, to $69/day to $345/day (depending on needs) for a full-time residential group home setting, to about $7,636/year for a supported work programme. There is a province-wide waiting list of about 1,800 for these types of programmes, and a waiting list of about 262 for employment training and supported employment programmes. Dr. Grondin also had information that special education classes would be available for Matthew in the regular school system until he reached the age of 21. No information relating specifically to London is contained in these reports.
