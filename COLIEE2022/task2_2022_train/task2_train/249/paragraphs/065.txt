As set out above, there are errors in law in both the medical officers' decision and in the visa officer's decision. These errors are serious enough to warrant setting aside the visa officer's decision, and an Order that the matter be sent back to a different visa officer for redetermination in accordance with these reasons. The redetermination should be based on all the circumstances of this case, and should specifically take into account a) whether the test of likelihood of excessive demands on expensive and social services limited in supply is met; and b) the visa officer's equitable jurisdiction to grant relief on humanitarian or compassionate grounds in light of the policy of family re-unification as set out in s. 3(c) of the
Immigration Act
. No further medical evidence required of the applicant and his family, as they have already gone through enough trouble and expense as it is. The redetermination should be based on the record that was before the original visa officer.
