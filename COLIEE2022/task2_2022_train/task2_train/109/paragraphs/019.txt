  The issues in this case are similar to the decision in  
 Tekie v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 25; 2005 FC 27: 
 
 
 
 "16 In my view, section 167 becomes operative where credibility is an issue which could result in a negative PRRA decision. The intent of the provision is to allow an Applicant to face any credibility concern which may be put in issue. 
 
 
 
 "17 The record in this case shows that the Officer had credibility concerns. Although the case was decided principally on the basis of 'objective fear', if the Applicant's contentions had been accepted, a positive PRRA would have resulted. The fact that, in the end, the PRRA decision is based on other than credibility does not lessen the right to an oral hearing."
