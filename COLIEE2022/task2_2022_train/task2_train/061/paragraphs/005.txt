  Mr. Allen was cross-examined on his affidavit and in answer to questions from his own counsel stated: 
 
 
 
 "There were a number of discrepancies in the [Mammoliti] interview which I felt were serious, and that I did give some fairly heavy weight to in coming up with my -- considered with my recommendation. And also her outline of the case history was also taken into consideration." 
 
 
 
 Later in his cross-examination, Mr. Allen was asked by counsel for the Solicitor General: 
 
 
 
 "Q.	Now, in your recommendation on p. 7 you state, 'I do not believe that anything has occurred since the review in '92 that would convince me of the bonafides of the marriage'. 
 
  A.	M'hmm. 
 
 
 
  Q.	What did you mean by that? 
 
  A.	Just simply that. That I did not come across any additional information that went to the bonafides of the marriage. And my review of the 1992 in-person interview [by Ms. Mammoliti] as an independent decision maker I assessed it as being as the marriage was not bonafide. 
 
 
 
  . . . . . 
 
 
 
  Q.	-- in person? What -- why, in this case, did you decide not to interview the applicant? 
 
  A.	A previous interview had been conducted eight and a half months earlier, and I felt that it was done in such depth and totality that it would be a waste of time to -- or it would be inappropriate to re-interview them. Ms. Mammoliti did a very thorough job in her interview as the notes indicate. 
 
 
 
  . . . . . 
 
 
 
  Q.	Now, is that a repetition of Ms. Mammoliti's statement, or is that your own statement? 
 
  A.	That's my own statement. Rather than listing the many discrepancies I simply indicated that she had some grave suspicions on the bona fides of the marriage."
