The decision in
Franklyn
, above, was not considered in the Board's analysis and the perspective of the Board even if valid, needed to examine an alternative point or points of view to discount prior to reaching a conclusion. In the recent case of
Smith v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.C.J. No. 2190 (F.C.), at paragraphs 7-8, which involved the issue of state protection for victims of domestic violence in St. Vincent, Justice Michael L. Phelan wrote as follows:
"The documentary evidence contained
both favourable and unfavourable comments on state protection for abused women
. The Panel chose to accept the more recent documentary evidence. The Panel concluded that the Applicant had not availed herself of all of the elements of state protection available to her, including, legal aid and complaints to judicial authorities.
"There is nothing patently unreasonable in the Panel's Conclusion that the Applicant had failed to prove that state protection was inadequate." (Emphasis added)
It is to be recalled that examination requires a discussion of one or more points of view from the evidence to reach a conclusion as is demonstrated by Justice Phelan. The Board's decision in this case unto itself (cas d'esp√®ce) requires focus on this particular applicant in situations that may be comparable to hers.
