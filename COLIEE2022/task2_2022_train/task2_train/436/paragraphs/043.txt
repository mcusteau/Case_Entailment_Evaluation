[43]
It is not for this Court, for all the above reasons, to conclude a decision on a case that is for the Board to reach; however, this Court has a responsibility in this specific case unto itself (cas d'esp√®ce) to remit it for reconsideration and thus conclusive redetermination based on the subjective and objective evidence, that must, at least, be analyzed, even if discussed in the shortest of decisions; nevertheless, recognizing that specificity in regard to the evidence is required for a demonstration of substantiation. Therefore, the case is remitted for redetermination by a differently constituted panel.
