  I am of the view the Minister has met the irreparable harm test. The words of Justices Sopinka and Cory in  
 RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at paragraph 71 are apt: 
 
 
 
 [...] In the case of a public authority, the onus of demonstrating irreparable harm to the public interest is less than that of a private applicant. This is partly a function of the nature of the public authority and partly a function of the action sought to be enjoined. The test will nearly always be satisfied simply upon proof that the authority is charged with the duty of promoting or protecting the public interest and upon some indication that the impugned legislation, regulation, or activity was undertaken pursuant to that responsibility. Once these minimal requirements have been met, the court should in most cases assume that irreparable harm to the public interest would result from the restrain of that action.
