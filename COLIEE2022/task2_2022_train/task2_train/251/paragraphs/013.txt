On the other hand, there is no way that subsection 5(4) could be an implied exception to paragraph 22(2)(a). To find that subsection 5(4) operates notwithstanding paragraph 22(2)(a) impliedly repeals the words "Notwithstanding anything in this Act" in paragraph 22(2)(a). Implied repeal usually is not applicable when provisions are enacted at the same time, which is the case here. Professor Sullivan states at page 188 in
Driedger

"Where two provisions are in conflict and the conflict cannot be resolved through other means, the more recently enacted provision prevails over and excludes the application of the earlier one. The earlier provision is said to be impliedly repealed."
