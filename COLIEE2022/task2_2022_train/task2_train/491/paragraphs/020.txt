The applicant was also apparently sent notice, during her leave, by CSE's Security Officer, that her belongings at the CSE would have to be vacated due to space constraints. As no response was received from the applicant, the possessions in question were packed and itemized and numerous attempts were made to contact the applicant to arrange for their delivery. They were then sent to the applicant's home on or after June 18, 1987.
