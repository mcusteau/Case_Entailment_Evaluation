Although Ms. Veillette's affidavit does not indicate that the applicant's responding submissions of February 6, 1992 were before the CHRC when it reached its decision, I must assume from the fact that the submissions are entitled "Answerers to Investigation Reports Regarding Complaints H30995 and H31558" and from the fact that both complaints were dismissed in the same decision, that the submissions were considered by the CHRC for both files.
