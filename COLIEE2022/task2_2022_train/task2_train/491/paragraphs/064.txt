[64]
It is clear from the documentary evidence accompanying the applicant's record, particularly the appendix outlining the material that was before the PSSRB hearing, that the applicant has accumulated a vast array of evidence pertaining to job classifications, etc. through voluntary disclosure by the CSE, as well as
Access to Information Act
and
Privacy Act
requests. Although both the
Privacy Act
and the
Access to Information Act
exempt disclosure of information which could reasonably be injurious to the conduct of international affairs, or the defence of Canada as well as to the efforts of Canada towards detecting, preventing or suppressing subversive or hostile activities, there is no evidence that any of her
Access to Information Act
or
Privacy Act
requests have been denied. Most importantly, the applicant has failed to demonstrate to me what aspect, if any, of this inaccessible evidence that was not obtained by the investigator (and was therefore not before the CHRC when it dismissed the applicant's complaints) is fundamental to the outcome of her case.
