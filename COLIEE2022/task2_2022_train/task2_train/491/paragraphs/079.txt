In light of the fact that the power vested with the CHRC under s. 44(3) is discretionary in nature, I must accept the following guiding statement of McIntyre, J., in
Maple Lodge Farms v. Government of Canada
, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2; 44 N.R. 354; at p. 7:
"It is, as well, a clearly-established rule that the courts should not interfere with the exercise of a discretion by a statutory authority merely because the court might have exercised the discretion in a different manner had it been charged with that responsibility. Where the statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith and where required, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the courts should not interfere."
