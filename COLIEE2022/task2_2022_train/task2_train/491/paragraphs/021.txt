It was apparently the practice of the applicant to "carry-over" her vacation leave, without objection by the CSE. On May 12, 1987, however, the Deputy Chief wrote to the applicant that she would not be allowed to "carry-over" her accrued 36 days of leave and advised her to schedule leave time or he would do so on her behalf. The applicant's lawyer responded to this notice on June 4, 1987, referring to her unchallenged tradition of "carry-over". The Deputy Chief replied that he was authorized to deny carry-over for all managers according to the collective agreement. While this conflict was in process, on May 28, 1987, the Deputy Chief circulated a memo informing all managers that this policy was going to be strictly enforced.
