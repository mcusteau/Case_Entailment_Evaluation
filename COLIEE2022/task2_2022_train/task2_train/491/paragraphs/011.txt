Prior to 1982, the appraisals that the applicant received from her supervisors for her work were "outstanding", "very good", etc; however, from 1982 to 1984, these appraisals deteriorated from "fully meets requirements" to "meets minimum requirements". After receiving the latter evaluation, the applicant entered Mr. Johnston's office with a union official, demanded to discuss the appraisal. Mr. Johnston admitted telling the applicant that such incidents are not conducive to a good working relationship and suggested that she find a job elsewhere in the CSE.
