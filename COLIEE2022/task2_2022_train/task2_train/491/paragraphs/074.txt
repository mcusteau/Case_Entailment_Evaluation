In the very least, it appears that the statutory discretion vested upon the CHRC to decide whether a complaint should be dismissed is wider under s. 44(3) than it was under s. 36(3) - but that does not mean that it is unlimited. Counsel for the respondent implied in his submissions that the legislative intent motivating this amendment was to give the CHRC the ability to dismiss complaints based on factors that are unrelated to the merits of the case or jurisdiction of the adjudicator. This argument appears to be supported by the following statement made in obiter dictum regarding the use of the word "warranted" as opposed to "substantiated" in the dissenting judgment of Madam Justice L'Heureux-Dub√© in
S.E.P.Q.A.
:
"... the use of these words by Parliament in amending the
Act
could not more clearly express an intention to give the Commission sufficient latitude to dispose of complaints otherwise than a determination of their merit." (
