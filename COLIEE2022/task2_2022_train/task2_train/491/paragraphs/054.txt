I note that investigators, the CHRC and reviewing courts are essentially without legislative guidance regarding the conduct of investigations. Section 43 of the
Act
empowers investigators with search and seizure abilities but sets no minimum duties of investigation. Furthermore, except in the limited domains of investigations pertaining to matters of immigration and customs and excise, no investigation
Regulations
have been created despite the provision under s. 44(4) of the
Act
for the Governor-in-Council, inter alia, to make
Regulations
prescribing the procedures to be followed by investigators.
