[1] Nadon, J.
: This is an application by Ms. Edwina Slattery (the "applicant") for judicial review, pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, of a decision of the Canadian Human Rights Commission (the "CHRC"), dated February 21, 1992. The decision, made under s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. H-6, as amended (the "
Act
"), was to dismiss two complaints (numbers H30995 and H31558) against the Department of National Defence on the basis that the applicant's allegations of discrimination were unfounded. The applicant seeks an order to set aside the CHRC decision of February 21, 1992 and to remit the matter back to the CHRC with the direction that it be referred to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal for a hearing, or in the alternative, that the investigation conducted in the matter be reopened.
