[38]
Three issues are raised by this application for judicial review:
i) What is the content of the duty of procedural fairness in the context of an investigation of a complaint and with respect to a CHRC decision to dismiss the complaint and has this standard been met in the case at bar?
ii) Did the CHRC err in law by concluding that there was insufficient evidence before it to justify taking the applicant's complaint to the Tribunal stage?
iii) Is the CHRC's conclusion that the applicant's allegation of discrimination is unfounded a finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, and therefore subject to judicial review according to s. 18.1(4) of the
Federal Court Act
?
