With respect to proof of discrimination, the applicant submitted that there was "more than enough evidence to convince a reasonable commission that on a balance of probabilities there is enough evidence to proceed to the next stage." This was particularly so in the case at bar given that the nature of the discrimination that she alleged to have encountered at the CSE was particularly difficult to prove. Regarding the difficulty in proving discrimination, notably systemic discrimination, she cited the following passage from Mendez:
"Discrimination is but rarely overt. One is more likely to find cases in which the discriminatory element is dissimulated, than vice-versa. For example, rather than admit that they refuse to hire or promote blacks or women, respondents might pretend that the candidates lack the necessary qualifications or experience for the job, that they show signs of having a difficult personality and an inability to get along with colleagues etc." (Mendez,
Presumptions of Discriminatory Motive in Title VII Disparate Treatment Cases
(1980), 32 Stan. L. Rev. 1129, at p. 1130.)
