[8]
Applicant's counsel proposes the following questions for certification:
"1. In making a 'preliminary' review of an application, where the officer does not find documentation sufficient to show that the applicant is qualified for the proposed 'intended occupation' may the officer summarily reject the application without having advised the applicant that s/he might not qualify to be assessed in the proposed 'intended occupation'?
"2. Where an officer concludes without having communicated to an applicant that s/he appears not to meet s. 81a selection criteria, does the officer err by not accessing its sister provision s. 11(3) before rejecting the case?"
Applicant's counsel has not indicated anything in the
Immigration Act
supporting the propositions that a visa officer is required to provide applicants with interim decisions to enable them to seek other remedies or obliging visa officers to exercise discretion under s. 11(3) of the
Regulations
on their own volition. In the absence of some reasonable indication by the applicant that either question is fairly arguable no question will be certified.
Application dismissed.
