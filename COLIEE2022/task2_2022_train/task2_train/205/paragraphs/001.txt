 Campbell, J. 
 : In the present case, the Applicant is the survivor of extreme violence perpetrated by her powerful step-father while living in Brazil, and she fears the violence will continue if she is made to return to that country. On this ground she claims protection. The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (RPD) accepted her evidence, but did not grant protection on a finding that she failed to rebut the presumption that the state of Brazil can protect her if she returns.
