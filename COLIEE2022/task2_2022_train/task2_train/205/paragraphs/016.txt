  For example, when a woman calls the police at 3:00 am to say that her estranged husband is coming through the window, the question is, are the police ready, willing, and able to make serious efforts to arrive in time to protect her from being killed? While it is true that even the best trained, educated, and properly motivated police force might not arrive in time, the test for "serious efforts" will only be met where it is established that the force's capability and expertise is developed well enough to make a credible, earnest attempt to do so, from both the perspective of the woman involved, and the concerned community. The same test applies to the help that a woman might be expected to receive at the complaint counter at a local police station. That is, are the police capable of accepting and acting on her complaint in a credible and earnest manner? Indeed, in my opinion, this is the test that should not only be applied to a state's "serious efforts" to protect women, but should be accepted as the appropriate test with respect to all protection contexts.
