  As guiding authority, the  
 Gender Guidelines 
  cite the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in  
 Lavallee 
  in footnote 31: 
 
 
 
 "For a discussion of the battered woman syndrome see  
 R. v. Lavallee 
 , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852. In  
 Lavallee 
 , Madame Justice Wilson addressed the mythology about domestic violence and phrased the myth as '[e]ither she was not as badly beaten as she claims, or she would have left the man long ago. Or, if she was battered that severely, she must have stayed out of some masochistic enjoyment of it.' The Court further indicated that a manifestation of the victimization of battered women is a 'reluctance to disclose to others the fact or extent of the beatings'. In  
 Lavallee 
 , the Court indicated that expert evidence can assist in dispelling these myths and be used to explain why a woman would remain in a battering relationship."
