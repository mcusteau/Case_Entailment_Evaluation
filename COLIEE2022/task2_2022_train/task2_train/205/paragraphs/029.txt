  As quoted above, with respect to the Applicant's action or inaction in seeking state protection in Brazil, the RPD made the following finding: 
 
 
 
 "I find that her efforts to avail herself of state protection falls far short of a diligent attempt prior to seeking asylum abroad and does not rebut the presumption that the state can protect its citizens ( 
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 at 726). The claimant made no effort to approach higher authorities in Sao Paulo or to ascertain if the investigation and failure to prosecute Silva was limited to a certain officer ( 
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Kadenko 
  (1996), 143 D.L.R.(4th) 532)." 
 
 
 
 Thus,  
 Kadenko 
  is applied by the RPD to create the expectation that the Applicant in the present case should have approached "higher authorities" or investigated the failure to prosecute the predator in order to establish that she attempted to access state protection. In my opinion, having regard to the decision in  
 Lavallee 
 , as advanced in the  
 Gender Guidelines 
 , the expectations are capricious because they are not based on a contextualized understanding of the Applicant's real life situation in Brazil; that is, there is no evidence that, for her, the expectations are realistic. As a result, I find that the RPD's application of  
 Kadenko 
  results in a reviewable error and renders the RPD's decision patently unreasonable.
