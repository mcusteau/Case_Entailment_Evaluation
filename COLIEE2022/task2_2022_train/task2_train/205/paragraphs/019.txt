  By leaving open how a claimant can discharge the burden to rebut the presumption of state protection by setting the test at "some clear and convincing evidence",  
 Ward 
  requires a contextual approach to be taken to evaluating each and every claim for protection, without reliance on any generalized pre-conceptions. As noted below in the analysis of  
 Kadenko 
 , the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 R. v. Lavallee 
 , [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852; 108 N.R. 321; 67 Man.R.(2d) 1 ( 
 Lavallee 
 ) has emphasized that findings with respect to a person's conduct must be made on the basis of an understanding of what to expect of that person's conduct in the context of his or her situation. Therefore, in my opinion, in any claim, including one based on fear of terrorism, the impact of  
 Ward 
  is that the statement in  
 Villafranca 
  that "situations of civil war, invasion or the total collapse of internal order will  
 normally 
  be required to support a claim of inability" cannot any longer be applied as a point of law.
