[218]
In conclusion on this point, this case involves a contemporary refusal (in 2005) to issue a certificate of citizenship to the Applicant based on the requirement found in paragraph 3(1)(d) of the current
Citizenship Act
that he be a "citizen" immediately before February 15, 1977. The legality of his exclusion can be examined today under the
Charter
and the
Bill of Rights
(despite the fact the
1947 Citizenship Act
, the
1952 Citizenship Act
and the
1970 Citizenship Act
have been repealed and do not exist anymore).
