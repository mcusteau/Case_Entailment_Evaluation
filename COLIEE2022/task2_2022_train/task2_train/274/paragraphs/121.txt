The
1947 Citizenship Act
was given Third Reading on May 16, 1946, and came into force on January 1, 1947. It repealed the
1914 Naturalization Act
and the
Canadian Nationals Act
(see subsection 45(1) of the
1947 Citizenship Act
). By way of consequential amendments introduced by a separate
Act
, the definition of "Canadian citizen" found in the
1910 Immigration Act
was repealed and substituted by a new text which provided that "Canadian citizen" meant a person who was a Canadian citizen under the
1947 Citizenship Act
(see
An Act to amend the Immigration Act
, S.C. 1946, c. 54).
