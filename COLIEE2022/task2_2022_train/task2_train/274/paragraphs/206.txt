[206]
In
Augier
, supra, this Court decided to set aside the Citizenship Officer's decision and held that paragraph 5(2)(b) of the current
Citizenship Act
(incidentally at issue in the present case) infringed subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
and was not justified by section 1. In this regard, Justice Mosley noted that Parliament failed, when it adopted the current
Citizenship Act
in 1977, to address the issue of children born out of wedlock to Canadian fathers and non-Canadian mothers. Paragraph 5(2)(b) of the current
Act
was found to address the injustice of a child not having the option of claiming citizenship from his Canadian mother when she was married to a non-Canadian father. Paragraph 3(1)(b) of the current
Citizenship Act
also removes the stipulation of being born in wedlock for children born abroad after February 14, 1977; however, it did not provide redress for persons in the applicant's situation born abroad, out of wedlock to Canadian fathers and non-Canadian mothers before February 15, 1977.
