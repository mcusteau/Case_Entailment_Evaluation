In 1868, the Parliament of Canada began adopting laws dealing with naturalization that established the conditions under which an alien could be naturalized as a "British subject" (see
An Act respecting Aliens and Naturalization
, S.C. 1868, c. 66 (the
1868 Naturalization Act
);
An Act respecting Naturalization and Aliens
, S.C. 1881, c. 13 (the
1881 Naturalization Act
)). Such statutes were at first referred to as "local
Acts
" until 1914 when the Imperial Parliament removed the local restriction applicable to certificates of naturalization granted beyond the United Kingdom.
