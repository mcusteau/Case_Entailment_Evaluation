Again, it is useful to refer to Justice Iacobucci's reasoning in
Benner
, at paragraphs 78 and 82, where he wrote:
"... That is, they do not determine the rights of the appellant's mother to citizenship, only those of the appellant himself. His mother is implicated only because the extent of his rights is made dependent on the gender of his Canadian parent.
"... The link between child and parent is of a particularly unique and intimate nature. A child has no choice who his or her parents are. Their nationality, skin colour, or race is as personal and immutable to a child as his or her own."
