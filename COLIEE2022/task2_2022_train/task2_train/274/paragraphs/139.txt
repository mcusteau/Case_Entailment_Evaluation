A person born in Canada (or on a Canadian ship) before January 1, 1947 is a natural-born citizen provided that on January 1, 1947, he was not an "alien". "Alien" means a person who is not a Canadian citizen, a Commonwealth citizen, a British subject or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland (section 2 and paragraph 4(1)(a) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
). That being said, any person born in Canada (or on a Canadian ship) after January 1, 1947, is a natural-born citizen (see paragraph 5(1)(a) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
). The Respondent concedes that the Applicant's father was a "Canadian natural-born citizen" until he died in 1996.
