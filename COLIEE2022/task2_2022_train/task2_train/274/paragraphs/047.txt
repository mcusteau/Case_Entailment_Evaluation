There is no definition of who is a "citizen" in the
Charter
and any statutory definition, such as the one in the current
Citizenship Act
, must comply with the
Charter
: see
Benner v. Canada (Secretary of State)
, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 358; 208 N.R. 81. The modern approach is to scrutinize differential treatment according to entrenched rights and freedoms and, in the s. 15(1) context, the concept of essential human dignity and freedom: see
Law v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 497; 236 N.R. 1;
