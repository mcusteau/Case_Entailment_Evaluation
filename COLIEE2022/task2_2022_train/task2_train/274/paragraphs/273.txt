[273]
A reasonable person would find that the current
Citizenship Act
reflects a demeaning and prejudicial view of the Applicant's worth, simply because he was born "out of wedlock" (see
Augier
, supra, at para. 23). It must be recalled that under the common law, "[t]he child of an unmarried woman is always born a "bastard" (see
Halsbury's Laws of England
, supra, at paras. 137-38). The current
Citizenship Act
continues to uphold the view that "bastards", even after legitimation, are not worthy to derive the citizenship of their natural father.
