Parliament did not immediately opt for a consolidated definition of "nationality" and "citizenship" in a single statute. Prior to 1947, and in parallel with the passing of legislation with respect to the naturalization of "aliens" as "British subjects", Parliament decided in 1921 that it was time to adopt a statute of its own pertaining to the "national status" of those persons who were already "Canadian citizens" within the meaning of the
1910 Immigration Act
, including their brides and children. This was done by the enactment of the
Canadian Nationals Act
.
