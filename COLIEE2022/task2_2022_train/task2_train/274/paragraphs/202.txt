That being said, with respect to the courts' power to examine allegations of discrimination in the context of citizenship status, Justice Iacobucci stated in
Benner
at paragraphs 51-52, that:
"
I am uncomfortable with the idea of rights or entitlements crystallizing at birth, particularly in the context of s. 15
. This suggests that whenever a person born before April 17, 1985, suffers the discriminatory effects of a piece of legislation, these effects may be immunized from
Charter
review. Our skin colour is determined at birth - - rights or entitlements assigned on the basis of skin colour by a particular law would, by this logic, 'crystallize' then. Under the approach proposed by the respondent, individuals born before s. 15 came into effect would therefore be unable to invoke the
Charter
to challenge even a recent application of such a law. In fact,
Parliament or a legislature could insulate discriminatory laws from review by providing that they applied only to persons born before 1985
.
"The preferable way,
in my opinion, to characterize the appellant's position is in terms of status or on-going condition. From the time of his birth, he has been a child, born outside Canada prior to February 15, 1977 of a Canadian mother and a non-Canadian father
. This is no less a 'status' than being of a particular skin colour or ethnic or religious background: it is an ongoing state of affairs. People in the appellant's condition continue to this day to be denied the automatic right to citizenship granted to children of Canadian fathers." (Emphasis added)
