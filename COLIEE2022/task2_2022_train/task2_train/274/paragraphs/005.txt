Under the
1910 Immigration Act
, a member of a "prohibited class" could not enter or remain in Canada (see Note 1). Despite the fact that the Applicant and his mother were "British subjects", such status did not, by itself, constitute a licence to enter, land or remain in Canada (see Note 2). Only "Canadian citizens" and persons who had "Canadian domicile" within the meaning of the
1910 Immigration Act
were allowed to enter and remain in Canada. The Applicant relies on
Order in Council re entry into Canada of dependents of members of the Canadian Armed Forces
, P.C. 1945-858 (9 February 1945), which was passed in 1945 and remained in force until May 15, 1947. Under that Order in Council, where a former member of the Canadian Armed Forces who served during World War II was a "Canadian citizen" or had "Canadian domicile" within the meaning of the
1910 Immigration Act
, his dependents were automatically granted the same status upon landing in Canada.
