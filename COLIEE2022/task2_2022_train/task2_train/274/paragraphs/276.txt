, supra, with respect to retroactivity, but for convenience it may be helpful to review the facts of this case once more. The applicant had been born out of wedlock, in St. Lucia, on May 9, 1966, of a father who was a Canadian citizen and a mother who was a permanent resident. In September 2002, the Applicant applied for proof of Canadian citizenship, claiming to have derived Canadian citizenship from his natural father. The Citizenship Officer determined that since the applicant was born out of wedlock outside of Canada, and that pursuant to the legislation then in force, Canadian citizenship could only be derived from the applicant's mother. The Immigration Officer stated that because the applicant's mother was not a Canadian at the time of the applicant's birth, the application for citizenship was refused.
