[256]
As can be seen, under subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
, equality is expressed in four different ways: equality before the law, equality under the law, equal protection of the law and equal benefit of the law. The section also guarantees against "discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability". These are the named or listed grounds of discrimination. The section makes it clear, by the phrase "in particular", that the named grounds are not exhaustive.
