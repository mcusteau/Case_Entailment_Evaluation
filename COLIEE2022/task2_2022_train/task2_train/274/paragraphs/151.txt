Jason Glynos was born to Canadian parents, Anita Glynos and Michael Glynos, in the United States in 1967. His father being a Canadian citizen, he himself became a Canadian citizen upon his birth pursuant to subparagraph 5(1)(b)(i) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
. In 1985, Jason's mother, Anita Glynos, was informed by the Vancouver Citizenship Office that her sons Jason and Byron were no longer Canadian citizens. She made an application for Canadian citizenship on behalf of her minor son Byron, pursuant to paragraph 5(2)(a) of the
1977 Citizenship Act
(which is the same as the text found in the current
Citizenship Act
). The Minister granted such citizenship to Byron Glynos effective January 5, 1987. The Court was informed at the hearing that no such application could have been made by Anita Glynos with respect to her son Jason because at that time Jason Glynos had attained the age of eighteen years and was no longer a "minor" child for the purposes of the
Act
(subsection 2(1) of the
1977 Citizenship Act
).
