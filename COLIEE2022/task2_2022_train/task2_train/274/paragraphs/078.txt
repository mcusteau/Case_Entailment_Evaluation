In Canada, a child of naturalized parents was included in the certificate of his father. It appears that despite its liberal wording, naturalization legislation was applied in a manner to limit the jus sanguinis principle to children born "in wedlock". I note that in
Abraham
, supra, an English case, it was held that legitimatio per subsequens matrimonium under the
1926 Legitimacy Act
did not confer, upon the legitimated child, any entitlement to a declaration that he was a natural-born subject of the Crown (see Note 12).
