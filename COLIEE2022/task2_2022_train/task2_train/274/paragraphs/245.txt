The problem was resolved in part in 1977. First generation citizens by descent born after February 14, 1977, were no longer required to submit an application for retention of citizenship or to have a domicile in Canada. Under the current
Citizenship Act
, only second generation citizens who hold citizenship on the basis of their birth abroad to Canadian citizens themselves born outside of Canada are required to apply for retention of their citizenship before reaching the age of 28. They must have registered as citizens, and have either (1) lived in Canada for at least one year prior to the application or (2) established that they have a substantial connection to Canada (see section 8 of the current
Citizenship Act
).
