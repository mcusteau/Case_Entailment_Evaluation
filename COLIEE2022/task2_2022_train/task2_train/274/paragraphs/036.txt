I note that the Citizenship Officer has no particular expertise with regards to the questions of legal applicability raised in this instance, which include determining when and how citizenship status was acquired under the law, and whether by operation of the law it was lost in the meantime. In this regard, the Court must be satisfied that any requirement prescribed by law or currently imposed by the Citizenship Officer with respect to the acquisition or extinguishment of citizenship status by operation of the law, does not infringe or deny any of the rights and freedoms constitutionally guaranteed by the
Charter
or declared to exist in Canada by the
Bill of Rights
. There is no room for deference in these matters: see
Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite-Bourgeoys et al.
, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 256; 345 N.R. 201. Accordingly, the impugned decision must be reviewed on a correctness standard and in light of the constitutional validity of any applicable provision of the current
Citizenship Act
.
