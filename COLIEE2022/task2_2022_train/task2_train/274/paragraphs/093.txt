I note that under the
1910 Immigration Act
, every person entering Canada was deemed to be an "immigrant" unless belonging to one of the "non-immigrant classes" which included, inter alia, "Canadian citizens" and persons who had "Canadian domicile". Section 2 of the
1910 Immigration Act
defined "alien" as a person who was not a British subject, while "Canadian domicile" could only be acquired by a person having his domicile for at least five years in Canada after having been landed therein within the meaning of the
1910 Immigration Act
. The
1910 Immigration Act
also provided that "Canadian domicile was lost, by a person voluntarily residing out of Canada not for a mere special or temporary purpose but with the present intention of making his permanent home out of Canada, or by any person belonging to the prohibited or undesirable classes". This is akin to today's loss of Canadian permanent resident status.
