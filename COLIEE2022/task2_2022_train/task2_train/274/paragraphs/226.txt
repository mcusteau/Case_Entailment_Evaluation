, the Federal Court of Appeal disposed of an appeal from a judicial review of a citizenship officer's denial of an application for proof of Canadian citizenship. The applicants' grandfather was born out of wedlock in Mexico in 1933; his parents had gone through a religious but not a civil ceremony at the time of his birth. The grandfather and his son (the father of the applicants) both obtained certificates of Canadian citizenship. The officer concluded that because the grandfather was born out of wedlock that he did not acquire Canadian citizenship under the laws in effect at the time and as a result was unable to pass on that citizenship to his son and grandchildren. The father commenced an application for judicial review of the finding that he was not a Canadian citizen, which was adjourned pending disposition of the appeal.
