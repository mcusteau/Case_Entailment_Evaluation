[260]
With respect to a child born outside Canada after February 14, 1977, the current
Citizenship Act
now purports to remove any previous legal impediment related to the marital status of parents at the time of the child's birth. It no longer matters that a child is born in or out of wedlock. As long as one of the parents is a citizen, that natural-born child automatically becomes a citizen. That being said, the new provision restricts citizenship status to the natural-born child of a Canadian parent. As I understand this exclusion, an adopted child will inherit Canadian citizenship only if at time of his birth one of his biological parents is a citizen (see paragraph 3(1)(b) of the current
Citizenship Act
).
