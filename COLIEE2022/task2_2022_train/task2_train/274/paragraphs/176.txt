While the Applicant and his mother could not have been "Canadian citizens" for the purpose of citizenship legislation that did not yet exist, it appears that in 1946, they nevertheless enjoyed, under the
1910 Immigration Act
, the rights and privileges that only "Canadian citizens" enjoyed (see A.H.F. Lefroy, "Annotation - Deportation from Canada of British subjects of Oriental origin" in
Re Thirty-Nine Hindus
, supra). In insisting today on a strict interpretation and application of section 4 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
, the Respondent does not take into account the particular circumstances of this case and of the war brides and their children. It is apparent that war brides and their children were all treated the same by the Canadian government under Order in Council, P.C. 858. Whether they were British subjects or not (it must be remembered that some 6,000 war children were born in Holland), whether they were born in wedlock or out of wedlock (it is reasonable to assume that a vast majority of these children were born out of wedlock), it remains that upon their landing in Canada they all acquired the status of their Canadian husbands or fathers. It is, practically speaking, a legal recognition of the effects of the lawful marriage of their parents on the nationality of the children born out of wedlock.
