Under English common law a person became a "British subject", as a general rule, upon birth in England (jus soli). This extended to persons born in all parts of His Majesty's "dominions and allegiance". In the late nineteenth century the "dominions" of the Crown included both the colonies and self-governing Dominions (Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Canada and Newfoundland). "Citizenship by birth", if I can used this expression for lack of a better phrase to describe the relationship between the individual and the "state", was perpetual and could not be revoked regardless of residency. By the same reasoning, "aliens", were unable to revoke their relationship with their place of birth. Therefore, at English common law foreign-born individuals could not become British "citizens" or "nationals" through any procedure or ceremony.
