[203]
At paragraph 59, Justice Iacobucci concluded:
"Simply put, I believe the discrimination, if it was discrimination, did not take place until the state actually denied the appellant's application for citizenship on the basis of criteria which he alleges violate s. 15 of the
Charter
. Until he tried to obtain citizenship and was refused, the appellant could not really claim to have been discriminated against ... The denial of his application took place on October 17, 1989, long after s. 15 came into effect. This denial is therefore open to
Charter
scrutiny."
