In this regard, Order in Council, P.C. 858, which applies to the case at bar, provided that before proceeding to Canada, the dependent had to undergo a medical examination. If a dependent were suffering from an infectious or contagious disease, his or her admission to Canada could be deferred until the production of a medical certificate establishing that the conditions was not infectious or contagious anymore. Save these cases of medical inadmissibility, every such dependent "shall be permitted to enter Canada and upon such admission shall be deemed to have landed within the meaning of Canadian immigration law ... [and] for the purpose of Canadian immigration law be deemed to be a Canadian citizen if the member of the forces upon whom he is dependent is a Canadian citizen and shall be deemed to have Canadian domicile if the said member has Canadian domicile".
