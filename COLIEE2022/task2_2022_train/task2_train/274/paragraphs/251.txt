[251]
In view of the rigid position taken by the Respondent that the Applicant is not a citizen, the Applicant is or has been effectively barred from making an application for resumption of citizenship to the Minister. Moreover, in any case, it is not clear today whether such an application could be granted by the Minister under section 11 of the current
Citizenship Act
, since the
1970 Citizenship Act
was repealed in 1977, and the Applicant's particular case does not come within the ambit of the exceptions mentioned in subsections 11(1.1) and 11(2) of the current
Citizenship Act
.
