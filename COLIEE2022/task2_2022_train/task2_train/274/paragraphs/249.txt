[249]
The simple fact that the automatic loss of citizenship was "prescribed by law" does not make it more compliant with due process if it has the potential to deprive one's life, liberty or security (see
Reference Re Motor Vehicle Act (British Columbia) S 94(2)
, supra). There should be some form of proper notice given to the individual, provided for in the statute or regulations. However, it is not the role of this Court to remedy past and current legislative or regulatory deficiencies. It is sufficient to declare that the claimed automatic loss of citizenship was and is unenforceable against the Applicant because it was and is contrary to due process and infringes the rights guaranteed by paragraphs 1(a) and 2(e) of the
Bill of Rights
, and section 7 of the
Charter
