First, I fail to see any problem with respect to ascertaining the legality of the alleged loss of citizenship status in light of the due process protections of the
Bill of Rights
, whether from a procedural or substantive rights perspective (
Authorson
, supra, at para. 50). At the time that the Applicant reached the age of 24 years, on December 8, 1968, the
Bill of Rights
was applicable. That being said, I doubt that the
Bill of Rights
can be characterized as a quasi-constitutional document of "lesser status", as suggested by the Respondent. In his reasons for judgment in
Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, Justice Beetz rehabilitated the
Bill of Rights
by putting to rest the concept that "it was merely an instrument of construction or interpretation" (see
MacBain v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.
, [1985] 1 F.C. 856; 62 N.R. 117 (F.C.A.)). As noted by Justice Beetz in
Singh
at paragraph 85: "[b]ecause [the
Bill of Rights
is] drafted differently [from the
Charter
], [it is] susceptible of producing cumulative effect for the better protection of rights and freedoms. But this beneficial result will be lost if [the
Bill of Rights
] fall into neglect. It is particularly so where [it] contain[s] provisions not to be found in the [
Charter
] ...".
