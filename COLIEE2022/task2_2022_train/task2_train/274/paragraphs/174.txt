That being said, if Order in Council, P.C. 858, could have led to an automatic grant of Canadian citizenship for the dependents arriving after January 1, 1947 and prior to May 15, 1947, as admitted by the Respondent, it must also have granted such rights at the coming into force of the
1947 Citizenship Act
to dependents who also had "citizen status" at that date. I fail to see why dependents who had legally landed in Canada prior to January 1, 1947, should be treated differently upon the coming into force of the
1947 Citizenship Act
and the amendment to the definition of "Canadian citizen" found in the
1910 Immigration Act
.
