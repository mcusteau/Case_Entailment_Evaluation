I note that the document on which the Applicant and his mother travelled in October 1946 was a blue coloured passport for natural-born British subjects. Inside the front cover is a letter emanating from the Secretary of State for External Affairs for Canada requesting, in the name of His Majesty the King, safe passage abroad and affording to the bearer (here the Applicant's mother and accompanying son) every assistance and protection he or she may stand in need. On its face, it appears that the passport was issued in New York by the Canadian Consulate and remained valid at least until October 11, 1948.
