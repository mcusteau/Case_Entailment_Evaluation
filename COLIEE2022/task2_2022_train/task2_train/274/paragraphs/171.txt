[171]
I note that the Orders in Council, P.C. 7318 and P.C. 858, refer to the legislative concepts of "Canadian citizen" and "Canadian domicile" which the
1947 Citizenship Act
purports to import or modify. The expressions "Canadian citizen" and "Canadian national" are not gratuitous concepts. Apart from their vernacular use, such expressions have been used and defined in Acts of Parliament adopted prior to 1947. They grant special privileges and rights to persons who have the status of "Canadian citizens" or "Canadian nationals". It is the duty of the Court to interpret and harmonize these expressions with the true intent of Parliament.
