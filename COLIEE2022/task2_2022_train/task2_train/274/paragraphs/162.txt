Be that as it may, Respondent's counsel asserts that past conduct of Canadian officials and contemporary declarations made by the Minister or the Assistant Deputy Minister are not legally binding. They merely propose an interpretation of the law. They do not create rights that are non-existent in law. It is submitted that the public statements in question "did not fully account for the subtleties of the relevant citizenship law and how it applies to the facts of a specific individual". The Respondent asserts today that Parliament determined in 1946 that "illegitimate children" born outside Canada to Canadian fathers did not have a valid claim for citizenship unless their mothers were also Canadian citizen at the time of birth.
