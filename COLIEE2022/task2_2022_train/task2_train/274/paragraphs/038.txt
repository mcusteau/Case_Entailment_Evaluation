The Applicant submits that the Citizenship Officer erred in law in determining that the Applicant is not a Canadian citizen based on her examination of prior citizenship legislation. In particular, the Applicant submits that the Citizenship Officer failed to consider the applicability and effects of Order in Council, P.C. 858. Since the Applicant's father was at all relevant times a "Canadian citizen" (before or after 1947), the Applicant and his mother automatically became "Canadian citizens".
