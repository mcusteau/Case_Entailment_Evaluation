The most common instances in which a person could lose his or her citizenship involved the voluntary and formal decision taken by an individual, who was not a "lunatic" or an "idiot", after attaining the full age of 21 years, to acquire the nationality or citizenship of a country other than Canada or to file a declaration of a renunciation of his Canadian citizenship in case of dual nationality (see sections 15 and 16 of the
1970 Citizenship Act
). For instance, the issue of renunciation may have arisen in situations where naturalized citizens were unable to draw attention from, or wished to perform official services for the government for their country of birth, and were unable to do so unless they resumed or retained their foreign citizenship exclusively. Renunciation of citizenship is still possible today (see section 9 of the current
Citizenship Act
). These cases pose no problem in terms of due process because the law requires that the individual not be a minor at the time of making the application for renunciation (or if there is a mental disability, that he understands the significance of renouncing citizenship).
