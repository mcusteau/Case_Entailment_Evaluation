As noted by Donald Galloway in his article titled "The Dilemmas of Canadian Citizenship Law" (1999) 13 Geo. Immig. L.J. 201, the statutory structure of the
1910 Immigration Act
is somewhat peculiar because the definition of "citizen" appears to overlap to a significant degree with the category of persons with a Canadian domicile. The immigration purposes of the statute could have been achieved simply by establishing two categories - persons born in Canada and persons not born in Canada who were domiciled in Canada. If there was no need to define British subjects and domiciled naturalized persons as citizens, why was it done? In this regard, Parry justifiably commented, supra, at 451, that one sees in the statute a parliamentary intent to assert its authority to identify individuals as "citizens", but to do so "in a way that did not threaten confrontation with colonial superiors".
