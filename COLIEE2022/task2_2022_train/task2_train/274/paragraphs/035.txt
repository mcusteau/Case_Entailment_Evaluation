The decision rendered by the Citizenship Officer must not be contrary to law: see paragraphs 18.1(4)(b) and (f) of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended. This goes well beyond this Court assuring itself that the interpretation chosen by the Citizenship Officer accords with any applicable citizenship legislation (or regulation or Order in Council) : see paragraph 18.1(4)(b) of the
Federal Courts Act
. In this regard, the Constitution of Canada is the supreme law of Canada, and any law, regulation, administrative decision or order authorized by statute that is inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution is, to the extent of the inconsistency, of no force or effect (subsection 52(1) of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (U.K.), 1982, c. 11) unless, in cases where a right guaranteed by the
Charter
is infringed or denied, such an infringement or denial can be justified under section 1 of the
Charter
: see
Davidson v. Slaight Communications Inc.
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1038; 93 N.R. 183. The
Bill of Rights
is a quasi-constitutional statute: unless the conflicting legislation expressly declares that it operates notwithstanding the
Bill
(as required by section 2) where federal legislation conflicts with its protections, the latter applies and the legislation (or part thereof) is inoperative: see
R. v. Drybones
, [1970] S.C.R. 282;
Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association et al.
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 884; 306 N.R. 34 at para. 28;
Authorson v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 40; 306 N.R. 335; 175 O.A.C. 363 at para. 32.
