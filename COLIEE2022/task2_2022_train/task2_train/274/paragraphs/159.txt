I find that contemporary declarations made by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and his Assistant Deputy Minister who are responsible for the application and implementation of Canadian citizenship legislation and policy, favour the legal position taken by the Applicant that war brides and their children were not obliged under the
1947 Citizenship Act
to apply for a grant of citizenship to the Minister (see letter dated September 21, 2005 from the Hon. Joe Volpe, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration; see also Canada, Parliament, Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration (10 May 2005), testimony of Mr. Daniel Jean, Assistant Deputy Minister, Policy and Program Development, Department of Citizenship and Immigration).
