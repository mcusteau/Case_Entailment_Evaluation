"Canadian citizens" and persons having "Canadian domicile" under the statute were allowed to enter and remain in Canada. This is tantamount to the mobility rights and the right to enter and remain in Canada given today to citizens and permanent residents. On the other hand, immigrants, passengers or other persons who fell within one of the "prohibited classes" were not permitted to either enter, land or remain in Canada. Being a "Canadian citizen" (or having a "Canadian domicile") meant that such a person had a legal right to establish himself or herself everywhere in Canada. Moreover, a "Canadian citizen" could not be deported (see
1910 Immigration Act
, ss. 23, 40).
