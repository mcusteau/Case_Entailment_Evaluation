[181]
In this regard, the Respondent submits that "the determination of an otherwise reviewable error does not always result in a matter being set aside and returned for re-determination". Indeed, where the result is inevitable, a reviewing court may decide not to grant the remedy sought: see
Abasalizadeh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 803; 2004 FC 1407 at para. 24. In this instance, the Respondent invites the Court to determine that the Applicant either lost his citizenship status because he and his mother returned to the United Kingdom in 1947 and remained thereafter in that country for more than a year, or because he failed to declare that he wished to retain his Canadian citizenship before reaching his 24th birthday. It is the Respondent's submission that this Court ought to dismiss the present judicial review application despite any error made by the Citizenship Officer.
