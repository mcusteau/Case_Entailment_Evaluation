Justice Linden, however, disagreed. In his opinion, the
Charter
applied to the appellant's case. He noted that the appellant was not seeking to have his citizenship changed retroactively to the point of his birth; rather, he was simply seeking to become a Canadian citizen on the date of his application - October 27, 1988. The law in force in Canada at that time was the
1977 Citizenship Act
and that law was subject to
Charter
scrutiny. Whether he was a Canadian citizen prior to his application was not directly relevant, since the real question was the constitutional legitimacy of the access to citizenship provided for in the
1977 Citizenship Act
at the time of his application. No retroactive or retrospective application of the
Charter
was therefore required. The relevant date was that of the rejection of the appellant's application for citizenship, not his date of birth (however, although he found there was legislative discrimination, he determined that it was nevertheless justified under section 1 of the
Charter
, largely for the reasons articulated by Justice LÃ©tourneau)
