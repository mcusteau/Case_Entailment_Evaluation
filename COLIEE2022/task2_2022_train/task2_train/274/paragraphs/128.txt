Therefore, all persons who were not "Canadian citizens" on January 1, 1947 and who were not "natural-born Canadian citizens" must be "naturalized" before becoming "Canadian citizens" (section 10 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
). This clearly applies to "British subjects" as well as to "aliens" and to wives of "Canadian citizens" who do not come within the ambit of the transitory provision (see section 9 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
) (see Note 18).
