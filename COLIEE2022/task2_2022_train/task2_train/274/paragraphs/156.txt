[156]
In the case at bar, I note that the Applicant was born in England on December 8, 1944. This is before February 15, 1977. Paragraphs 3(1)(d) and 3(1)(e) of the current
Citizenship Act
govern such cases. There has been no suggestion that the Applicant was entitled, immediately before February 15, 1977, to become a citizen under paragraph 5(1)(b) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
which deals with persons born outside Canada after December 31, 1946 (paragraph 3(1)(e) of the current
Citizenship Act
). The particular situation of persons born outside Canada prior to 1947 is regulated by paragraph 4(1)(b) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
. Therefore, the Citizenship Officer had to determine whether or not the Applicant was a citizen immediately before February 15, 1977 (paragraph 3(1)(d) of the current
Citizenship Act
).
