Well beyond any precise legal definitions, it remains that the archetypical character and symbolic value of "citizenship" has always been closely attached to freedom and liberty from ancient times to the present day. Indeed, citizenship status has been used by the courts to enhance fundamental rights and to prevent chauvinism and arbitrary conduct when the Canadian Constitution did not explicitly guarantee political rights and freedoms (see Note 27). Moreover, the concept of "citizenship" permits the identification of the individual with his mother country or country of adoption. It has come to be identified with one's origin or acquired nationality.
