[268]
Under the current
Citizenship Act
, any person
born in Canada after February 14, 1977
, is a citizen, with limited exceptions (see paragraph 3(1)(a) and subsection 3(2) of the current
Citizenship Act
). Therefore, a child born in Canada after February 14, 1977 to a parent with no legal status in Canada at all is nevertheless a citizen (jus soli). Note that the natural-born Canadian citizens may leave Canada at any time and do not need to maintain any connection with Canada. A prolonged absence from Canada will not result in a loss of Canadian citizenship unless, at the age of majority, that person renounces his Canadian citizenship in favour of the citizenship of another country (section 9 of the current
Citizenship Act
).
