The Respondent assumes that since the Applicant left Canada prior to 1947, he was not a British subject with Canadian domicile when the
1947 Citizenship Act
took effect. This is incorrect. It is clear that the Applicant was a natural-born British subject. By virtue of Order in Council, P.C. 858, he was deemed to be a Canadian citizen and did not need to maintain Canadian domicile since his father was born in Canada. I also note that upon the coming into force of the
1947 Citizenship Act
, the Applicant had only been out of Canada for six weeks.
