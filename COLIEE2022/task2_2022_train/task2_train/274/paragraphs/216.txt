[216]
With respect to the argument made by the Respondent that citizenship was lost some time in 1968 when the Applicant turned 24 years old, the evidence on this issue is not conclusive. I cannot say that "the result is inevitable" and that the Applicant indeed lost his citizenship status. With respect to the question of determining at what time the Applicant's rights were engaged, there is no indication in the evidence that the people working at the Canada House in London, England, in 1968, ever told the Applicant about the loss of citizenship provisions of the
1947 Citizenship Act
or the
1952 Citizenship Act
. It appears from the evidence that the Applicant simply made an inquiry and was given standard immigration forms. These forms could have been given to the Applicant by any clerk at the desk. Their remittance to the Applicant does not permit this Court to infer that there was any examination of the law or legal determination made by a responsible Citizenship Officer as to the citizenship status and rights of the Applicant.
