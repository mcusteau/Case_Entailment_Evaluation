I note that in
Crease v. Canada (Minister of State for Multiculturalism and Citizenship)
, [1994] 3 F.C. 480; 78 F.T.R. 192 (T.D.), which is referred in the above passage of the Supreme Court's decision in
Benner
, Justice Wetston relied extensively on the opinion of Justice LÃ©tourneau in the Federal Court of Appeal decision earlier rendered in
Benner
(C.A.), and determined that the
Charter
did not apply and that the plaintiff's rights under section 15(1) of the
Charter
had not been infringed in any event (see
Crease
, supra, at paras. 41-42, 46, 66-67) (see Note 24).
