Lefroy went on to cite the propositions made at the time by Sir Samuel Griffith, Chief Justice of Australia, and a member of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and which were summarized in the following manner in his annotation:
1. British nationality confers upon the holders of the status of British nationals the right to claim the protection of the British Sovereign as against foreign powers;
2. It does not, of itself, entitle the holder to any political rights or privileges within any part of the Empire, but it may be a condition of the enjoyment of such rights and privileges;
3. In the absence of any positive law to the contrary, a British national is probably entitled to claim the right of entry into any part of the British Empire;
4. A competent legislative authority of any part of the Empire may, by positive law, restrict or deny that right of entry.
