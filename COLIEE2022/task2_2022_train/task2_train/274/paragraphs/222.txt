[222]
While there is no evidence of the Applicant's mother's intent on January 1, 1947, I do not need to dismiss the Respondent's argument on this basis. None of those computations of time should affect a minor child who was considered a "disabled person" under statute. This is clearly against due process. As a minor child, the Applicant did not voluntarily make any choices. This brings me to address the Respondent's argument that the Applicant automatically lost his citizenship status when he turned 24 because he failed to make an application for retention of citizenship in accordance with paragraph 4(2)(b) of the
1953 Amendment Citizenship Act
or the
1970 Citizenship Act
(that is, between the age of 21 and 24).
