In its original sense, the term "citizen" referred to a member of a "free or jural society" (civitas), who possessed all the rights and privileges that could be enjoyed by any person under its constitution and government. While many societies had a concept of citizenship, it was in the Greek city-states that the status was first defined and it was further refined in Rome: see William Kaplan, "Who Belongs?
