I am unable to accept the Respondent's argument to the effect that the Applicant and his mother automatically lost their citizenship one year after they had returned to England. This is an argument presented for the first time in 2005 in the Respondent's memorandum of fact and law. I am unable to accept this new argument in view of the absence of proper evidentiary record, combined with the fact that the Applicant's mother has never been made a party to this proceeding. Procedural fairness demands that the Applicant's mother be given the right to make representations as to the alleged loss of her Canadian citizenship (see the discussion infra with respect to the Federal Court of Appeal in
Veleta
).
