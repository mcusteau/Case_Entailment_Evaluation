However, a natural-born Canadian citizen born outside of Canada automatically ceases to be a citizen at 24 years (or on the first day of January 1954, whichever is the later date) unless he has his place of domicile in Canada at such date or has between 21 and 24 years, filed a declaration of retention of Canadian citizenship (paragraphs 4(2) and 5(2) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
). That being said, such a person may file a petition for resumption of citizenship to the Minister (see section 6 of the
1970 Citizenship Act
).
