As noted earlier, the only law in Canada prior to 1947 which referred to the words "Canadian citizen" was immigration law. Therefore, the reference in paragraph 3 of Order in Council, P.C. 858 "for the purposes of Canadian immigration law to be a Canadian citizen" is not determinative. When Order in Council, P.C. 858 was passed, the independence of citizenship law did not exist. That being said, the definition of "Canadian citizen" found in the
1910 Immigration Act
was modified upon the coming into force of the
1947 Citizenship Act
on January 1, 1947 so as to mean, from that point forward, any person who was a "Canadian citizen" within the meaning of the
1947 Citizenship Act
. Since then, the interplay between "citizenship law" and "immigration law" has been continuous. But there is a further and even more important point to make here. By necessary implication, the dependents of members of the Canadian Armed Forces who became Canadian citizens on January 1, 1947, were from then on deemed to be "Canadian citizens" within the meaning of both the
1947 Citizenship Act
and the
1910 Immigration Act
. This tantamount to a statutory grant of citizenship (
