The naturalization legislation broadly defined the "national status" of all individuals. Any person born within His Majesty's Dominions before 1947, including Canada, automatically acquired British subject status at birth by operation of the law alone regardless of the status of the person's parents: see paragraph (1)(a) of the
1914 British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act
, and paragraph 3(a) of the
1914 Naturalization Act
.
