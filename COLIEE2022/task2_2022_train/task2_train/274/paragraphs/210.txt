While section 15 of the
Charter
cannot be used to attack a discrete act which took place before the
Charter
came into effect, not every situation involving events which took place before the
Charter
came into force will necessarily involve a retrospective application of the
Charter
. Where the effect of a law is simply to impose an on-going discriminatory status or disability on an individual, it will not be insulated from the
Charter
review simply because it happened to be passed before April 1985. If it continues to impose its effects on new applicants today, then it is susceptible to
Charter
scrutiny: see
