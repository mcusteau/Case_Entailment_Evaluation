The second category of cases involved the voluntary decision taken by the Governor in Council to revoke the citizenship of an individual who had obtained Canadian citizenship by false representations, fraud, or by concealment of material circumstances. In such instances, an order could only be made following a report of the Minister. The
1970 Citizenship Act
sets out the procedure the Minister must follow, beginning with notice to the individual. The person could request that the Minister refer the case for inquiry by a commission constituted for that purpose by the Governor in Council. The procedure followed by the commission was of a judicial nature and the individual in question would have the possibility to present evidence and make arguments. A somewhat similar procedure exists today except the inquiry is devoted to a judge of this Court (see sections 10 and 18 of the current
Citizenship Act
). Accordingly, these cases pose no problem at least in terms of procedural rights attached to the concept of due process.
