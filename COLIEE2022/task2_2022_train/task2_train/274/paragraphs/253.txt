I have already found that Order in Council, P.C. 858 is tantamount to a statutory grant of citizenship. My conclusion is that dependents of members of Canadian Armed Forces constituted a special group of persons. Children born out of wedlock or in wedlock derived their Canadian citizenship through their natural or lawful father. This result was achieved notwithstanding the fact that paragraph 4(1)(b) of the
1947 Citizenship Act
provided that in case of a child born out of wedlock outside Canada prior to January 1, 1947, citizenship could only be derived from the natural mother.
