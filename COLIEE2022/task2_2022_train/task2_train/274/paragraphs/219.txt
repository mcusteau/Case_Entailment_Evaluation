The Citizenship Officer's failure to consider and apply Order in Council, P.C. 858 is determinative in this case. This error of law vitiates the whole decision and is sufficient in itself to order that the impugned decision be set aside. This is not a case in which the Court should exercise its discretion to refuse to set aside an administrative decision on the basis that it can otherwise be upheld on grounds not considered by the Citizenship Officer. The evidentiary record with respect to the Applicant's loss of citizenship is incomplete and does not permit the Court to make any conclusive findings in this regard. In any case, I have further grounds for dismissing the Respondent's arguments and subsidiarily making a declaration of unconstitutionality.
