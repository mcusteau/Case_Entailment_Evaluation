In
Shah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1418; 240 F.T.R. 15; 2003 FC 1121 (F.C.), Blanchard, J., found that the Board had erred in law in failing to provide sufficient reasons for rejecting a claim under s. 97 of the
Act
. In that case, the Court also held that the "test under s. 97 of the
Act
does not require a determination of subjective fear of persecution but rather a determination that removal would subject an applicant to a danger of torture or to risk to life or to risk to cruel or unusual treatment or punishment under certain conditions". The fact that the Board had totally failed to comment on the evidence in that respect justified quashing the decision because the reasons given amounted to no more than an unsupported conclusion with respect to the applicant's claim.
