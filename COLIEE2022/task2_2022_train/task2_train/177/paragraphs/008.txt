  By letter dated March 8, 2004, Ms. Uanseru provided detailed submissions in support of her contention that neither the cash bond nor the performance bond should be forfeited. Amongst other things, Ms. Uanseru submitted that Mr. Mark had not in fact moved out of her house prior to his attendance at the interview on January 24, 2004. She further submitted that she had done everything possible to ensure that Mr. Mark complied with the conditions of his release, and that, having exercised all due diligence, her bonds should not be forfeited.
