  The only case of which the parties are aware dealing with the forfeiture of a bond in the immigration context is the decision of Justice Dawson in Gayle v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, [2002] F.C.J. No. 446. This decision dealt with a bond forfeited under the provisions of the former Immigration Act. It appears that the forfeiture of an immigration bond was also considered by Justice NÃ¶el in Bcherrawy v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1825, another decision under the Immigration Act, where the reasoning in Gayle was adopted.
