 [9] 
  The operative portions of the Officer's March 17, 2004 decision provides: 
 
 
 
 I have carefully reviewed the submissions provided by your [counsel's] office in response to the decision to forfeit the bonds. I have also reviewed the facts of the case. I am satisfied that there was a breach of the condition of release. As such, it is my decision to forfeit the $5,000 cash bond. No action will be taken with respect to the $5,000 Performance Bond.
