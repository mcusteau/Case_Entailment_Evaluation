 [25] 
  In deciding whether the Officer properly exercised her discretion in the circumstances of this case, I am guided by the principles espoused by the Supreme Court of Canada in Maple Lodge Farms v. Canada, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2. That is, where statutory discretion has been exercised in good faith, in accordance with the principles of natural justice, and where reliance has not been placed upon considerations irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose, the courts should not interfere.
