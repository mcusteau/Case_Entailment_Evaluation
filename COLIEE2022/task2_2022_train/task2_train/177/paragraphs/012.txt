  While conceding that the evidence on this point was somewhat confusing, Ms. Uanseru contends that the Officer erred in finding that Mr. Mark breached a condition of his release. According to Ms. Uanseru, although Mr. Mark spent the night of January 23, 2004 at his wife's residence, he did not physically move out of Ms. Uanseru's residence until January 24, 2004. As a consequence, notice was provided to the respondent prior to Mr. Mark changing his address, as required by the conditions of his release, and no breach occurred.
