  The Officer clearly assessed the circumstances that the applicant would face. The Officer noted that some Tamils are singled out for questioning and detention but this is done on suspicion that those targeted are LTTE supporters or sympathizers. The Officer noted that the applicant's family in Sri Lanka had not been targeted for mistreatment due to their ethnicity and that there was no evidence that the applicant was a person of interest or that inquiries had been made to his family about his whereabouts. The Officer found that there was insufficient evidence to satisfy her that the applicant will be targeted or to support the applicant's statements that he would be personally discriminated because of his ethnicity.
