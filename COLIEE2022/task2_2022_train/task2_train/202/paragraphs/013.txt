  Both the reasons dated April 26, 2012 and the addendum dated July 11, 2012 refer to the evidence and submissions and reflect the Officer's consideration of that evidence in assessing whether the discretion to grant an exemption on H&C grounds should be exercised. The Officer clearly states that she reviewed all the additional submissions which included: a letter from the applicant's counsel; a letter of support from a friend; a letter of employment from the applicant's part-time employer; a T-4 tax slip; the report of a psychological assessment; photos; and country documentation, in addition to the documents previously reviewed in the April, 2012 decision.
