  As a result of the amendments to section 25, the risks alleged by the applicant of persecution, torture, risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment on the basis of his race and nationality were considered in his refugee and PRRA determination and cannot be reconsidered in the H&C. The H&C considerations focus on other hardships which would not meet the same threshold as required under sections 96 and 97. In some circumstances there may be some overlap between the allegations of risk and of hardship. However, to give effect to the amendments, the assessment should focus on other hardships, including discrimination and adverse country conditions and how they affect the particular applicant, and whether this amounts to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship.
