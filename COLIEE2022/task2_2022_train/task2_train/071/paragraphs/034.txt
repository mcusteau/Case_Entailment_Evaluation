  As noted, the applicants provided absolutely no response to these letters. Passport Canada again wrote them on March 11, 2011, asking them to file submissions, if they had any information that "would contradict or neutralize the information" in the December 3, 2010 letters. Once again, the applicants provided no response whatsoever. It was only after these two requests for submissions that Passport Canada forwarded its submissions to the adjudicator. The applicants did not make any submission to the adjudicator.
