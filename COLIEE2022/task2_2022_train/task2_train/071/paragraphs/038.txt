  There is ample authority from other contexts, where the interests concerned are important but do not concern the life or liberty of individuals, to support the notion that the requirements of natural justice are met if the investigator provides a summary of the material facts that are relevant to the determination to be made. For example, in the context of inquiries by visa officers under section 40(1)(a) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27, this Court has determined that the requirements of procedural fairness are met when the visa officers suspect that an applicant for a visa may have made a misrepresentation in his or her application, if the visa officer writes a "fairness letter", outlining the perceived misrepresentations and inviting the applicant to make responding submissions (see e.g.  
 Sinnathamby v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 1421, 209 ACWS (3d) 670;  
 Mahmood v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 433, 388 FTR 69; and  
 Natt v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 238, [2009] FCJ No 281). To somewhat similar effect, in the human rights context, it is sufficient if the Human Rights Commission investigator discloses a summary investigation report (as opposed to all the evidence gathered in the investigation) and provides a copy to the Commission and the affected parties, who are afforded the ability to make submissions to the Commission (see e.g.  
 Merham v Royal Bank 
 , 2006 FC 237 and  
 Hutchinson v Canada (Minister of Environment) 
 , [2003] 4 FC 580 (CA)). Likewise, in the context of transferring prisoners to higher security institutions, this Court has found that disclosure of summaries of the information compiled against a prisoner is sufficient to meet the duty of procedural fairness (see e.g.  
 Mymryk v Canada (Attorney General) 
 , 2010 FC 632, 382 FTR 8).
