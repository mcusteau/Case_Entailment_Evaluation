  As the adjudicator rightly noted in his decision, misuses of passport services are "serious matters". Canada is required to ensure that its passports are not misused to deter illegal migration and meet foreign governments' expectations regarding the reliability of Canadian travel documents. Failure to do so may have serious consequences, including the facilitation of illegal entries and exits from countries by unidentified individuals and the consequential security risks and impairment to the ability of legitimate Canadian travelers to travel to other countries without undue impediment. Accordingly, the imposition of a five-year ban in the circumstances of this case was entirely reasonable.
