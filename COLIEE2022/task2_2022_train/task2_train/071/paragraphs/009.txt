  The respondent also argues that many of the grounds raised by the applicants in their Memorandum of Fact and Law seek to have the Court re-weigh the evidence before the adjudicator, which is not the function of a court in a judicial review application.

On the latter point, the respondent asserts that there was ample evidence before the adjudicator to support his conclusion that the result reached is within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes and, accordingly, that the adjudicator's decision is reasonable. The respondent also challenges portions of the evidence filed by the applicants in their Motion Record, arguing that they are inadmissible as they contain facts that were not before the adjudicator.
