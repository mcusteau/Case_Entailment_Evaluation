 Gleason, J. 
 : This is an application for judicial review from the decision of an adjudicator at Passport Canada, issued on July 19, 2011, in which the adjudicator revoked the applicants' passports and refused passport services to them for five years. The adjudicator concluded on the balance of probabilities that the applicants had allowed two other individuals to use their Canadian passports and that the applicants had provided false information in support of their replacement applications. The impostors in question were apprehended in Dubai, on January 15, 2010, and were in possession of the applicants' Canadian passports and Canadian citizenship cards. The impostors (who were Iraqi citizens) were attempting to use this documentation to board a flight from Dubai to Toronto. The impostors had paid $10,000 U.S., each, for the applicants' passports.
