  The general rule, which has been qualified as "trite law", is that an applicant on judicial review can only rely on evidence that was before the decision-maker (see e.g.  
 Ochapowace Indian 
   
 Band v Canada (Attorney General) 
 , 2007 FC 920 at para 9, 316 FTR 19 [ 
 Ochapowace Indian 
   
 Band 
 ]). As the respondent correctly notes, there are limited exceptions to this rule, namely when the evidence relates to a challenge to procedural fairness, the tribunal's jurisdiction or is general background information of assistance to the court ( 
 Ochapowace Indian 
   
 Band 
 ).
