  The respondent argues that there was no breach of procedural fairness. More specifically, the respondent submits that there was nothing before Passport Canada which would have caused it to doubt the applicants' ability to understand written English and that in any event, it was incumbent upon the applicants to obtain whatever translation services might have been necessary. In terms of disclosure, the respondent argues that all the material facts were disclosed to the applicants and that Passport Canada is not required to disclose every document contained in its investigation file, but, rather, it is sufficient if affected parties are provided with the material facts an investigation discloses and an opportunity to respond to them. The respondent asserts that this occurred in the present case. As for the assertion that it is unfair for the record to have been placed before the Court via the paralegal's affidavit, the respondent notes that this has been common practice and that it would be highly improper to engage in a cross-examination of the type desired by the applicants as a judicial review application is not a hearing  
 de novo 
  but, rather, a review based on the record before the tribunal.
