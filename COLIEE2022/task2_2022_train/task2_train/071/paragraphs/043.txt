  In my view, these draft letters do not indicate that Passport Canada pre-judged the situation as it continued its investigation after May 28, and the subsequent investigation included inquiry into possible exculpatory evidence. Accordingly, in my view, there is no basis upon which an informed person would think that it is more likely than not that Passport Canada had prejudged the situation. Moreover, there is no suggestion made that the adjudicator, who actually made the decision that is the subject of this judicial review application, was biased. Accordingly, the applicants' second basis for challenging the adjudicator's decision also fails.
