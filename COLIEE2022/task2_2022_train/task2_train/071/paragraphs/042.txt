  The applicants suggest that Passport Canada investigators demonstrated bias as they "rushed to judgment" and determined the applicants' guilt before their investigation was completed. In support of this allegation, counsel for the applicants relied principally on draft letters, dated May 28, 2010 that were not sent to the applicants, and which set out the conclusion that Passport Canada believed that the applicants had permitted another person to use their passports. These letters, however, are clearly drafts, as they contain many handwritten amendments and are followed in the record by a memo from a more senior official in Passport Canada to the author of the drafts, pointing out the various issues that still needed to be investigated. These various issues were, in fact, investigated by Passport Canada. The final versions of the letters that were sent to the applicants on December 3, 2010 were substantially different from the drafts and, as noted, summarized all the material facts that Passport Canada had uncovered during its investigation.
