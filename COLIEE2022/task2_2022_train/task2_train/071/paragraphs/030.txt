  In the present case, in support of their allegation that they were denied procedural fairness through non-disclosure, the applicants point to a record of over 100 pages, which was before the adjudicator, and note that they only received a handful of letters from Passport Canada. They argue that the entire record should have been disclosed to them and that certain portions of it contained potentially exculpatory evidence that they did not have the opportunity to expand upon nor to draw to the attention of the adjudicator. More specifically, the applicants assert that Passport Canada undertook several lines of inquiry that proved fruitless. These included Passport Canada's inability to determine what transpired at the Syrian Embassy in Ottawa when it issued visas in respect of the applicants' passports on January 4, 2010; Passport Canada's unsuccessful attempt to obtain copies of the 12 Canadian documents that the impostors had in their possession when apprehended in Dubai on January 15, 2010; and Passport Canada's discovery that a Shoppers Drug Mart receipt that was also in the impostors' possession was not issued from the same location as where the applicants had their passport photos taken. The applicants argue that had this information been disclosed to them, they could have made arguments in support of their position that they were not complicit in allowing the impostors to use their passports.
