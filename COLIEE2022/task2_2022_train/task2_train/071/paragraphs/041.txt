  Turning, next, to the applicants' second ground of attack, it is axiomatic that a decision may be set aside on the ground of bias of the decision-maker, where there is a reasonable apprehension that such bias exists. The test for establishing a reasonable apprehension of bias was restated by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 R v S (RD) 
 , [1997] 3 SCR 484, 151 DLR (4th) 193 at para 111, where the Court noted that a reasonable apprehension of bias exists where a reasonable and informed person, with knowledge of all the pertinent circumstances, facing the matter realistically and practically, would conclude that the decision-maker's conduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. In determining if there is a reasonable apprehension of bias, the court is to consider whether an informed person would think that it is more likely than not that the decision-maker, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly (
