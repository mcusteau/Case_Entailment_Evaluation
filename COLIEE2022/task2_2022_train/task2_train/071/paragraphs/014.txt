  The respondent is correct in asserting that none of the facts contained in the impugned paragraphs in the applicants' affidavits was before the adjudicator. This is not disputed by the applicants. While conceding that, normally, a court on judicial review is limited to considering facts contained in the record before the inferior tribunal, the applicants argue that an exception applies in this case, which would render the impugned portions of the applicants' affidavits admissible. More specifically, they assert that the evidence relates to a challenge to procedural fairness or is general background information, both of which have been found to be admissible in judicial review applications. The respondent, for its part, argues that even if certain portions of the impugned evidence might be relevant to the applicants' procedural fairness arguments, such evidence will not be admissible unless and until the Court determines that there was a breach of procedural fairness.
