First, is the Immigration Officer's mention of the applicant not having relatives or close friends established in Canada to assist him. In my view, having or not having relatives or close friends in Canada simply cannot be described as a personal "quality" similar to those which are listed in Factor 9 quoted above. There are other provisions in the
Act
and in the
Regulations
where the existence of relatives in Canada may be taken into account but it is not a factor, in my view, to be considered in assessing personal suitability.
