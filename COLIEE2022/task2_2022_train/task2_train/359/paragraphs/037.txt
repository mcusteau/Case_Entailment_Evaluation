On the first two parts of the test, at page 51 of his reasons, the Adjudicator said:
"...
I am prepared to assume that the evidence before me is sufficient to establish the existence of the first two requirements - namely, an inequality of bargaining position and the unconscientious use of a position of power
." (emphasis mine)
In his view, Mr. Brine failed on the third element. Adjudicator Outhouse was of the view the settlement was not "substantially unfair" to the complainant because the notice period was in accordance with what the courts in Nova Scotia were awarding.
