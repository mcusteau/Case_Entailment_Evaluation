The vast majority of the CHRC's decisions reviewed by the court concern Commission action in the final stage in its screening process where the Commission, after the receipt of an investigator's report, must decide whether to request the establishment of a Human Rights Tribunal to adjudicate on the complaint (and where appropriate remedies may be granted if a complaint has been made out) or whether to dismiss a complaint which ends the matter. The Commission's action, in such circumstances, is based on s. 44(3) of the
Act
when the Commission "is satisfied", "having regard to all of the circumstances of the complaint" an inquiry into the complaint is warranted or not warranted. Very recent decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal on this type of Commission decision are
Bell Canada v. Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada et al.
, [1999] 1 F.C. 113; 233 N.R. 87 (F.C.A.), where the court reviewed a CHRC decision to request the establishment of a Human Rights Tribunal and
Holmes v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.
(1999), 242 N.R. 148 (F.C.A.), considering and discussing an appeal from the Trial Division in a case in which the Commission had dismissed a complaint after investigation. See also
Zundel v. Canada (Attorney General) et al.
(1999), 170 F.T.R. 194 (T.D.), where Evans, J., considered and dismissed the challenge to a Commission decision to request a Tribunal.
