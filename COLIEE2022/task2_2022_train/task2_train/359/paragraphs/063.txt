Jerome, A.C.J.'s, view of the matter is confirmed by two recent decisions of the Federal Court of Appeal. In
Slattery v. Canadian Human Rights Commission
(1996), 205 N.R. 383 (F.C.A.), Hugessen, J.A., considered an appeal from my colleague Nadon, J.'s, decision dismissing a judicial review application of a Commission decision based on s. 44(3)(b)(i) of the
Act
. The Commission had dismissed a complaint because the evidence of the allegation of discrimination was unfounded. Hugessen, J.A., in dismissing the appeal said:
"We are all of the view that the Commission fully complied with its duty of
fairness to the complainant when it gave her the investigator's report, provided her with full opportunity to respond to it, and considered that response before reaching its decision
." (emphasis mine)
