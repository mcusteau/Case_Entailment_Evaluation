What happened to the Dunphy Report is hard to piece together. The CHRC did not provide any affidavit in this judicial review application. What is known is that the Dunphy Report was not circulated to the applicant or to Ports Canada for comment as is usual Commission practice and as required by procedural fairness. Furthermore, it is known the Dunphy Report was not considered by the members of the Commission when making their decision not to deal with Mr. Brine's complaint. The certified tribunal record prepared by the Secretary of the Commission pursuant to rule 317 of the
Federal Court Rules
lists the documents that were before the Commission when the Commission made its decision not to deal with the applicant's complaint. One of the documents provided by the Secretary of the CHRC was a chronology of events which said this:
"15-04-96 Complaint signed
04-04-97
Investigation report received from contractor
04-09-97

25-07-97
Section 40/41 report
25-07-97 Disclosure begins
06-08-97 Submission from respondent
