Recently, in
Canada Post Corp. v. Barrette
(supra), Evans, J., said at page 268 of the reported case:
"[31] Moreover, since the purpose of the statutory scheme is to reduce inequality, and accordingly has been said to possess a quasi-constitutional status, a court should be reluctant to conclude that the Commission has erred by taking too narrow a view of the exceptions to its statutory duty to deal with complaints of discrimination.
On the other hand, it is arguable that closer judicial scrutiny is justified when the Commission decides not to deal with a complaint, which will normally be a final disposition of the matter
