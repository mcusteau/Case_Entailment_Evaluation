The Commission's decision is contained in a letter to the applicant dated December 11, 1997, and reads in its material parts:
"Before rendering their decision, the mem­bers of the Commission reviewed the report disclosed to you previously as well as your submission dated October 24, 1997 and the submission dated August 8, 1997 signed by Robert L. Barnes and the re­spondent's submission dated August 6, 1997, signed by Alan J. Stern. After examining this information, the Com­mission decided not to deal with the com­plaint. The reasons for the Commission's decision are as follows:
Pursuant to s. 41(1)(d) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, the Commission has resolved not to deal with the complaint because:
on April 18, 1995, the complainant entered into an agreement with the respondent;
this agreement, which the complainant signed on the advice of his legal repre­sentative, states that the complainant is satisfied that the respondent has satis­fied all its obligations under the
Canada Labour Code
and the
Canadian Human Rights Act
."
