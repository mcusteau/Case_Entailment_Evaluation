In
Pathak v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.
, [1995] 2 F.C. 455; 180 N.R. 152 (F.C.A.), MacGuigan, J.A., said at p. 464:
"Only the report of the investigator and the representations of the parties are necessary matter for the Commission's decision. Anything else is in the discretion of the Commission."
At page 465, MacGuigan, J.A., said, after analyzing the scheme of the
Act
and, in particular, s. 44:
"Everything happens on the receipt of a report. The report is not only the trigger of Commission action but is also the only document referred to as the basis for a Commission decision as to how to proceed."
