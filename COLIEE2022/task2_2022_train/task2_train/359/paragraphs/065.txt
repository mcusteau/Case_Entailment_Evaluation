The views of Hugessen, J.A., in
Slattery
and DÃ©cary, J.A., in
Bell
(supra), confirm the statutory obligation of the Commission to consider an investigator's report once received as well as the obligation, based on procedural fairness, to obtain comments from the parties on such a report before deciding it. The Commission breached its statutory obligation and procedural fairness in this case. It did not consider the Dunphy Report as required by law before dealing with the complaint and did not have the parties' input on that report before deciding.
(b) Was Section 41(1)(d)
Properly Invoked
