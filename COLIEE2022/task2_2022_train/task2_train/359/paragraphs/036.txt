Adjudicator Outhouse ruled against Mr. Brine on both points. On the issue of unconscionability, he adopted the three-part test enunciated by Hallett, J., in
Stephenson v. Hilti (Canada) Ltd.
(1989), 93 N.S.R.(2d) 366; 242 A.P.R. 366 (T.D.), at pp. 370 and 371, as follows:
"(1) That there is an inequality of bargaining position arising out of ignorance, need or distress of the weaker party;
"(2) The stronger party has unconscientiously used a position of power to achieve an advantage; and
"(3) The agreement reached is substantially unfair to the weaker party or, ... it is sufficiently divergent from community standards of commercial morality that it should be set aside."
