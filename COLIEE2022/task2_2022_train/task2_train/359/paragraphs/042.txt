Challenges, however, have been initiated at the more earlier stages of the Commission's screening process. For example, in
Canada Post Corp. v. Barrette
, [1999] 2 F.C. 250; 157 F.T.R. 278 (T.D.), Evans, J., dismissed a judicial review application in which Canada Post attacked a Commission decision to deal with - to investigate - a complaint of wage discrimination under s. 11 of the
Act
, and in which Canada Post argued the Commission had wrongly applied ss. 41(1)(a), (b) and (e) of the
Act
. Another example of this type of Commission decision being reviewed is
Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.
(1997), 130 F.T.R. 241 (T.D.), a decision of Rothstein, J., as he then was, who dismissed a Canada Post challenge of a Commission decision to deal with a complaint. Rothstein, J.'s, decision was recently upheld by the Federal Court of Appeal, file A-402-97, April 29, 1999, per Desjardins, J.A., on behalf of the court.
