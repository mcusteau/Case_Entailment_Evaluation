DÃ©cary, J.A., then set out a global or framework approach for types of cases where the Commission is performing its screening functions on receipt of an investigation report. He said this referring to
Bell
, supra:
"[38] The
Act
grants the Commission a remarkable degree of latitude when it is performing its screening function
on receipt of an investigation report
. Sections 40(2) and 40(4) and ss. 41 and 44 are replete with expressions such as 'is satisfied', 'ought to', 'reasonably available', 'could more appropriately be dealt with', 'all the circumstances', 'considers appropriate in the circumstances' which leave no doubt as to the intent of Parliament. The grounds set out for referral to another authority (s. 44(2)), for referral to the President of the Human Rights Tribunal Panel (paragraph 44(3)(a)) or for an outright dismissal (paragraph 44(3)(b)) involve in varying degrees questions of fact, law and opinion (see
Latif v. Canadian Human Rights Commission
, [1980] 1 F.C. 687 (C.A.), page 698, Le Dain, J.A.) but it may be said as a general rule that Parliament did not want the court
at this stage
to intervene lightly in the decisions of the Commission." (emphasis mine)
