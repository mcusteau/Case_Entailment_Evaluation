[49]
In my view, the text of the
Act
itself leads to the conclusion I have reached concerning the hard look which the Commission is required to make when deciding not to deal with a complaint. First, Parliament has indicated there is a prima facie obligation on the Commission to deal with a complaint. Section 41(1) says that "subject to s. 40, the Commission
shall deal
with any complaint filed with it
unless
". Second, when the Commission decides not to deal with a complaint - not to investigate the complaint -it decides, in effect, the merits of that complaint in the sense the complaint is terminated. Third, to stress the importance of such a decision, the
Act
compels reasons for deciding, the only instance where this is a statutory requirement in respect of Commission decisions.
