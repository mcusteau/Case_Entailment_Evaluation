The matter was then reconsidered by a Review Tribunal in
Brennan v. Canada and Robichaud
(1990), 11 C.H.R.R. D/194 (Rev. Trib.). The Review Tribunal decided that it would not set aside the agreement on grounds of duress and issues of public policy. It said this at paragraph 19:
"19. To a limited extent we agree. It is indeed a valid, binding and enforceable agreement. And we find the arguments advanced by Mrs. Robichaud suggesting the agreement was reached under conditions of duress, oppression
, lack of adequate counsel, and undue pressure to be unconvincing."
The Review Tribunal then examined the remedies available under the
Act
that serve a broader public purpose in terms of restitution to personal (private) indignities and those which serve the public interest by acting as a deterrent for employers as an educational vehicle cautioning employers with respect to matters such as poisoned work environment or the powers/vulnerability relationship existing between supervisors and the supervised. The Review Tribunal ruled that in order to fulfil its responsibilities under the
Act
, it must consider the terms of the agreement to ensure that an appropriate "full corrective" is achieved with respect to matters of public policy at issue.
