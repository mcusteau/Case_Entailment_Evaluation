Ports Canada, through its solicitors, responded on August 6, 1997 in the following way:
"Thank you for your letter of July 25, 1997, enclosing a copy of the investigator's report.
"Our client is prepared to rely on its submission dated July 19, 1996; however, by way of a further comment we wish to point out that Mr. Brine pursued a claim under the
Canada Labour Code
and we had a hearing before an Adjudicator on April 1st and 2nd, 1997.
"In his decision, dated June 2, 1997, the Adjudicator rejected arguments that the settlement agreement was void for uncertainty or unconscionable. He stated that:
'The settlement agreement and release, when read together, contain all necessary terms and are capable of enforcement.'
"He therefore declared that the settlement agreement and release were binding on the parties and declined to hear the complaint of unjust dismissal on its merits."
