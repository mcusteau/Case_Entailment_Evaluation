The Tribunal record reveals that the applicant's solicitors responded to the Commission's invitation by forwarding two letters. The first letter is dated August 8, 1997 commenting on the Labour Code Adjudicator's decision. The applicant's solicitors said this:
"Although the settlement agreement was upheld by the
Labour Code
Adjudicator, he did so because he was applying a very stringent legal test with respect to Mr. Brine's 'capacity' to execute a binding legal agreement. In order to overturn this type of agreement on the basis of mental incapacity, it is necessary to show that the illness suffered by the party rendered him
incapable
of understanding or appreciating the nature of the document before him.
"Although Mr. Brine did not meet this test of legal incapacity, the evidence clearly confirmed the severity of his disability, and the inappropriateness of signing off on his legal rights at that time. The evidence also disclosed that the employer was very aware of his mental condition, both at the time of his termination, and at the time the settlement was negotiated. Essentially, the employer used 'hardball' tactics, including allegations of dismissal for cause, and the withdrawal of salary and benefits, as the means to obtain Mr. Brine's signature on the settlement agreement. The employer clearly took advantage of Mr. Brine's vulnerability at a time when the employer was aware of his weakened emotional and mental status."
