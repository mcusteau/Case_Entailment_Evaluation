Section 6(1) of the
Patent Regulations
contemplates a quick procedure. The applicants seek to have this proceeding characterized as a judicial review in order that rules 1612 and 1613 of the
Federal Court Rules
would apply. Since I heard this matter the Federal Court of Appeal has heard the appeal from the McGillis, J. decision, supra, and upheld the decision in this regard. In the Court of Appeal decision, October 25, 1993, (unreported) A-389-93, Mahoney, J.A., stated at p. 6:
"What is authorized by subsection 6(1) of the
Regulations
is an application 'to a court for an order prohibiting the Minister from issuing a' NOC. That seems clearly to be an application within the contemplation of paragraph 18(1)(b) of the
Federal Court Act
. The application is required by subsection 18(3) to be made under section 18.1 and the prescribed procedures are to be found in Part V.1 of the
Rules
. The learned trial judge did not err in determining that the proceedings are governed by the Part V.1
Rules
."
