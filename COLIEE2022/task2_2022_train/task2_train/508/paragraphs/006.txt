Prior to the passage of the
Patent Act Amendment Act
(Canada), a person obtained an NOC by submitting a NDS to the Minister in accordance with the
FDA
. The
Patent Regulations
now require that a further procedure be followed by the applicant if its NDS is in respect of a drug for which there is patent extant that has been listed on a patent list by an "innovator" company.
