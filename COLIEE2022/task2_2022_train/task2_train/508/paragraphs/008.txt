By Originating Notice of Motion filed June 4, 1993, Pfizer applied pursuant to s. 6(1) of the
Patent Regulations
for an order prohibiting the Minister from issuing an NOC to Nu-Pharm in connection with 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg tablets of the drug, fluconazole, on the grounds that "none of the allegations" in the Notice of Allegation "are justified". Pfizer in its Notice of Motion did not make any reference to s. 18 or 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
but it did state that it intended to rely on s. 55.1 of the
Patent Act
and the presumption contained therein.
