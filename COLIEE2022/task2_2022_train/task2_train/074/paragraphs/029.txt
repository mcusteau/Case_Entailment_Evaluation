  However, before considering these provisions, it is important to understand how the  
 Act 
  works regarding offenders subject to a long-term order. To this end, we must look at s. 99.1 of the  
 Act

 "99.1 A person who is required to be supervised by a long-term supervision order is deemed to be an offender for the purposes of this Part, and ss. 100, 101, 109 to 111 and 140 to 145 apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to the person and to the long-term supervision of that person."
