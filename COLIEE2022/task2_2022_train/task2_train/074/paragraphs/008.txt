  Section 99.1 of the  
 Act 
  provides that "A person who is required to be supervised by a long-term supervision order is deemed to be an offender for the purpose of this Part [that is, Part II of the  
 Act 
 ], and ss. 100, 101, 109 to 111 and 140 to 145 apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to the person and to the long-term supervision of that person". Section 133(4.1), which allows residency conditions to be imposed on an offender who is eligible for statutory release, is not included in the list of sections which apply mutatis mutandis to dangerous offenders. It therefore does not apply to a long-term supervision order.
