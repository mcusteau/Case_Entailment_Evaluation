 [19] 
  The main purpose of the  
 Act 
  is contained in s. 100 of the  
 Act 
 . It is to contribute to the maintenance of a just, peaceful and safe society by allowing the NPB to impose the conditions necessary to protect society and facilitate the reintegration of the offender into the community. The NPB's function is guided by the principles set out in s. 101 of the  
 Act 
 . There is no doubt that Parliament intended the NPB to use its expertise in taking the appropriate decisions to protect society while facilitating the reintegration of the offender into the community. The Court must treat this type of expertise with the greatest restraint.
