[43]
Finally, in relation to the credibility of the Applicant, Aguebor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1993] F.C.J. No. 732 (F.C.A.) (
Aguebor
) at paragraph 4 states: "[a] s long as the inferences drawn by the tribunal are not so unreasonable as to warrant our intervention, its findings are not open to judicial review." In other words, the RPD's credibility findings in the present case are entitled to a high degree of deference and the burden rests upon the Applicant to show that the inferences drawn by the RPD could not reasonably have been drawn.
