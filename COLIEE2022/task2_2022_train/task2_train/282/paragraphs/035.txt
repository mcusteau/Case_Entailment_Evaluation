The RPD made a global negative credibility finding as follows:
In summary, based upon the foregoing negative credibility findings, I do not believe that the claimant was arrested and detained by the police in POK or Pakistan in December 2005 and in January 2006 and that there is an FIR registered against him and a warrant for his arrest in Pakistan, all because of his UKPNP political membership and activities as is alleged. I find that all of these allegations to be an attempt by the claimant to embellish his refugee protection claim.
As a result, the RPD found that the Applicant lacked credibility concerning the central elements of his refugee claim and rejected the Applicant's other evidence from family members and newspaper articles.
