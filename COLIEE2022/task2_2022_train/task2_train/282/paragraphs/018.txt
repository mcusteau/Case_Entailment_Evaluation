The Applicant says that the Speaker of the Legislature, Seyab Khalid, had stolen two truckloads of foreign aid goods, but the case against him was dismissed. However, the details were published in the newspapers. At a meeting on April 10, 2006, the UKPNP unit in Bosagala decided to oppose Seyab Khalid with their full strength. Subsequently, the Applicant distributed posters that accused Seyab Khalid of stealing foreign aid. Seyab Khalid came to Bosagala on April 22, 2006 and put pressure on the Applicant through the Deputy Superintendent of Police. He said that he would win the election "through hook or crook" and "you damaged my reputations by posting the poster in area. Therefore, you must remove these posters by yourself and apology publicly for what you have done." He told the Applicant, in front of the police, that he would face "horrible consequences" if he did not comply.
