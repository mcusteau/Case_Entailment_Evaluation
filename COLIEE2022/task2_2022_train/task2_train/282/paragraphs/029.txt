Thirdly, the RPD found that if the Applicant was credible, he would have made a refugee claim immediately upon entering Canada. Instead, he arrived in Canada on April 28, 2006 and waited until June 13, 2006 to make a refugee claim. When asked why he waited approximately six weeks before making the claim, the Applicant said that when he first arrived in Canada he intended to make a refugee claim, but he did not have any knowledge of how to do it. As soon as he learned that he could make a refugee claim, he did so in the last week of May 2006, and he was given an appointment to meet with immigration officials on June 13, 2006. He testified that he waited until he had retained a lawyer to assist him. The RPD rejected the Applicant's response that he did not know how to make a refugee claim in Canada because the Applicant told the immigration officer that he had heard in Kashmir that there were a lot of UKPNP members living in Calgary. Also, a UKPNP member picked him up at the airport when he arrived in Calgary. The RPD concluded that he had been in a position to consult with the members of the Kashmiri community about how to make a refugee claim in Canada shortly after he arrived.
