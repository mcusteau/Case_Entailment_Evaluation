It is well settled that the test to be applied in considering whether an interlocutory injunction is appropriate is the tri-partite test articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)
, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311. In that case, the Court stated that an applicant must establish three principles in order to be granted an interlocutory injunction. Those principles are:
i. the existence of a serious issue to be tried;
ii. the existence of irreparable harm if the injunction is not granted; and
iii. the balance of convenience must favour granting the injunction.
All three elements must be considered in turn.
