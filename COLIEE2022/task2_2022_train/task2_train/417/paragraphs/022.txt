[22]
In the case at bar, the elections and procedures of the Band Council are governed by the provisions contained within the Election Regulations. Accordingly, whether there exists a serious issue depends largely on whether those Regulations were followed in reaching the decision to suspend the applicants from the Band Council, or whether the Band Council has the inherent right to suspend the applicants.
