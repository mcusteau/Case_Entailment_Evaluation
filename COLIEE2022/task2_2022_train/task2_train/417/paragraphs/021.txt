This Court is seized with this motion and underlying application for judicial review on account of the fact that the respondent Band Council falls within the meaning of a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" as defined in section 2 of the
Federal Courts Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7. As I held in
Roseau River Anishinabe First Nation v. Atkinson
, 2003 FCT 168, 228 F.T.R. 167 at paragraph 19:
Â¶ 19 In past cases the Federal Court has assumed jurisdiction over Indian band councils, regardless of whether the election of the band council was pursuant to band custom or the
Indian Act
, see
Canatonquin v. Gabriel
, [1980] 2 F.C. 792 (F.C.A.) and
Lameman et al. v. Gladue et al.
(1995), 90 F.T.R. 319 (T.D.). As Mr. Justice Rothstein stated in
Sparvier v. Cowessess Indian Band No. 73
, [1994] 1 C.N.L.R. 182; 63 F.T.R. 242 (T.D.), at p. 4:
It is well settled that for purposes of judicial review, an Indian band council and persons purporting to exercise authority over members of Indian bands who act pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Act constitute a "federal board, commission or other tribunal" as defined in section 2 of the
Federal Court Act
[...] an Indian band council came within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court where the election of the band council was pursuant to band custom and not the
Indian Act
