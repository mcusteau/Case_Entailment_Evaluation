Gabriel v. Mohawk Council of Kanesatake
, 2002 FCT 483, [2002] F.C.J. No. 635 (QL), Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer considered irreparable harm within the context of Band Councils, stating at paragraphs 26-27 that the political nature of the offices held by councillors creates a very different situation than occurs within a general employment context:
¶ 26 The applicant argues that he will suffer irreparable harm, which cannot be quantified in monetary terms, should I refuse to grant an interlocutory injunction reinstating him as Grand Chief of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake pending a final order in the matter. The jurisprudence makes it clear that the office of Chief is political and that the law concerning wrongful dismissal does not provide for remedies for loss of elective office. This was recognized by my colleague MacKay J. in
Frank v. Bottle et al
(1993), 65 F.T.R. 89 at paras. 27-28 where he said:
In my view the law concerning wrongful dismissal, and damage awards for that, deals with situations of employer-employee relations and it does not provide for remedies for loss of elective office. The Chief is not an employee of Council nor in my view can he be considered an employee of the Tribe. The office of Chief is political, filled by valid election, with attendant responsibilities that transcend any concept that he is an employee of the Tribe, just as is the office of council member.
... Without determining the issues which are not before the Court, in my view, he would have no claim in damages for wrongful dismissal and probably no realistic monetary claim for loss of reputation.
[...]
¶ 27 Therefore, if I did not grant an injunction and the applicant subsequently succeeded with his application for judicial review, he would not be entitled to the relief normally available to employees who have been dismissed. This, in my view, constitutes irreparable harm.
