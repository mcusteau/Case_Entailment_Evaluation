  Although not determinative of the content of section 44(1)2, the above noted evidence indicates that if the Respondent had returned to Germany within six months after her arrival in Canada, German authorities would likely have allowed her to re-enter the country on the basis of her permanent residence permit. By extension, in my view, it seems clear that "competent authorities" in Germany would not have considered the Respondent's residency status to have lapsed immediately upon her leaving Germany.
