  Below, I will only address the Board's findings respecting the exclusion of the Respondent from refugee protection by virtue of Article 1E of the  
 Refugee Convention 
  as that is the only matter raised in this application for judicial review. The Minister is not challenging the Board's finding that the Respondent has established a well-founded fear of persecution against Iran. I note also that during the course of her second refugee hearing, the Respondent did not pursue her allegations of persecution against Germany.
