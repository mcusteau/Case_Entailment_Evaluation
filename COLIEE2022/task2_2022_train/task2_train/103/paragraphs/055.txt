  The Board in its reasons went on to consider whether the Respondent could regain status in Germany after finding that she had indeed lost status at the time of her admission to Canada. In my view such an analysis is not relevant to the determinative issue. As I stated above, at the time of her arrival in Canada, the Respondent was in possession of a permanent residency permit from Germany which was valid until December 31, 2000. In other words, at the operative date for determining exclusion the Respondent had a valid permit which gave her residency in Germany, including the right to return.
