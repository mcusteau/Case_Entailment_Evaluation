  Much of the evidence which contradicts the Board's finding that "competent authorities" in Germany would have considered the Respondent to have lost her German residency status the moment she left for Canada was cited by the Board in its reasons. Specifically, the Board mentions the following evidence that was before it: 
 
 
 
 - The claimant testified that when she went to the German Consulate in Toronto in March 2001 to inquire about her status in Germany, she was advised that since she had been outside of Germany for more than six months, her residency permit would have expired and that she would have to apply for a new visa if she intended to return to Germany. 
 
 
 
 - On March 6, 2003, the Respondent's counsel wrote to the German Consulate to inquire about the present status of the Respondent. Counsel did not name the Respondent but set out some material facts including that the Respondent had resided in Germany from 1986 until 1999; that she left Germany in 1999 "with no intention of returning and has not returned"; and that she has an identity document - an unbefristet Aufenhaltserlaubnis - issued by Germany which was valid until December 2000 but had not been renewed. The Respondent's counsel asked whether "the aforementioned status would exist upon return to Germany", among other questions. The following day, S. Kohler, a visa officer with the German Consulate, replied and in response to the above question stated that "[t]he status of the individual ceased to exist following German regulations after 6 months". 
 
 
 
 - On May 21, 2003, Peter Ziegler, Counsellor, Cultural and Legal Affairs, with the German Embassy in Ottawa wrote to the Respondent's counsel in reply to his inquiry about the Respondent's German residency document. Mr. Ziegler stated that: 
 
 
 
 "Under s. 44 I Nr. 1 of the German  
 Aliens Act 
 , the unlimited residence permit expires when the resident is absent from Germany for more than six months. The person you mentioned could not have that document renewed while being in Canada because it was still valid. The only thing she could have done was to go back to Germany to avoid the six months being completed."
