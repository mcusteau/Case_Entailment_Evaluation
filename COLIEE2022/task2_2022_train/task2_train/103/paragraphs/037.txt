  The Board's decision in this case, however, does not concern the evidentiary basis for the Respondent's claim for refugee protection or a finding in respect of the credibility of the Respondent. It is recognized that such factual determinations are within the purview of the Board's expertise. In this case, the Board's factual finding is not related to the core of its expertise. Rather, the decision at issue revolves around whether by operation of section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
  the Respondent lost her residency status in Germany, including her right to return to Germany, from the moment she decided that she wanted to stay in Canada permanently. Ultimately, the Board's decision concerns an interpretation of German law and its effect on the Respondent's situation. In my view, such a finding is not within the expertise of the Board. I find that the Court is in a better position to determine whether the evidence sufficiently establishes the content of section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
 . As a result, with regards to this second factor, I would extend less curial deference to the Board.
