  As the Board found that at the time of her "admission" into Canada the Respondent was no longer recognized as having the rights and obligations of a national of Germany, the Board held that Article 1E of the  
 Refugee Convention 
  did not apply to her. At pages 19 and 20 of its decision, the Board stated: 
 
 
 
 "The claimant's German residency permit lapsed on September 15, 1999, when she left Germany for Canada, with the intention to stay in Canada permanently. She had no automatic right to return to Germany once she came to Canada and according to the relevant German law and communications from German officials entered as exhibits in this hearing, it is unlikely that she would have been able to reacquire a German residency permit. I find that this is particularly so, once the claimant applied for refugee status in Canada on September 20, 1999, giving effect to her intention before leaving Germany. 
 
 
 
 "Once the claimant left Germany for Canada, intending to stay permanently, resulting in the lapsing of her residency permit, she forfeited the right of return to Germany, and the other 'basic rights' enumerated by the courts in  
 Shamlou 
 . Applying the test enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Mahdi 
 , when she applied for admission to Canada, the claimant was no longer recognized by the competent authorities of Germany as a permanent resident of the country." 
 
 
 
 In reaching its decision, the Board stated that it also took into account the Respondent's reason for leaving Germany, namely that she was being harassed and teased because of her race and nationality which resulted in psychological and medical problems for her.
