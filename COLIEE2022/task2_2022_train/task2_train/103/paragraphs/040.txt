  In the present case, the question before the Board concerns the Applicant's residency status in Germany as of September 15, 1999 - the date of her admission into Canada. The Board must first determine the meaning of section 44(1) of the  
 Aliens Act 
 , and then it must apply the law as determined to the circumstances of the Respondent's case. The jurisprudence establishes that determining the content of foreign law is a finding of fact, while determining how the foreign law is applied is a question of law: see  
 Sharma 
 , above, at paragraph 10. In my opinion, the nature of the question militates towards affording less deference to the Board.
