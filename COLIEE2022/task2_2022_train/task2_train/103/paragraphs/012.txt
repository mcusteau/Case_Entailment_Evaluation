  In his decision released on May 17, 2002, Justice Paul Rouleau concluded that the First Panel had erred in finding that the Respondent did not have the right to return to Germany:  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Choovak 
 , 2002 FCT 573. Justice Rouleau held that the proper time for determining the existence of the right to return to a country is not the date of the refugee hearing, but the date of the application for admission to Canada. In support of his statement as to the relevant date, Justice Rouleau cited  
 Mahdi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1995] F.C.J. No. 1623; 191 N.R. 170 (F.C.A.), wherein at paragraph 12 the Federal Court of Appeal held as follows: 
 
 
 
 "[...] the real question that the Board had to decide in this case was whether the respondent was, when she applied for admission to Canada, a person who was still recognized by the competent authorities of the United States as a permanent resident of that country."
