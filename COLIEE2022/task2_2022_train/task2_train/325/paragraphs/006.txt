My colleague, Teitelbaum, J., was also faced with an application for recusal in the
Chief Victor Buffalo
[see footnote 3] case wherein he made an exhaustive review of the Canadian jurisprudence with regards to reasonable apprehension of bias with which I concur entirely. For the present purposes I will limit myself to reproducing these two paragraphs:
"[65] It appears to be plaintiffs' belief or, at least, it is the belief of plaintiffs' counsel, that knowing certain individuals involved in the governing of Canada, either as prime minister or as a minister of the Crown or as a member of the House of Commons or of the Senate or of a committee thereof or of having been a member or fund raiser for a legal federal political party gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.
"[66] My first comment is that this submission, in the manner it is stated in the notice of motion is outrageous and is totally irrelevant to the issue of a reasonable apprehension of bias."
Mr Justice Teitelbaum denied the application for his recusal and his decision was confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal.
