Reed, J.
: The plaintiffs bring an application for an interlocutory injunction to prevent the defendant from infringing patent number 1,222,724 and industrial design registration number 56,231. The patent carries the title "Garment Bag with Improved Packing Capability". The industrial design is with respect to a "locking trolley for luggage". The objects of the patent are summarized as follows:
"An objective of the present invention is to provide a new and improved traveling garment bag in which garments can be packed in a more secure condition that is less susceptible for causing wrinkles. Another objective is to provide a new and improved garment bag in which certain articles like shoes can be packed to obtain better space utilization without creating an unwieldy condition when the bag is folded into the suitcase-like configuration. Still another objective is to provide a new and improved garment bag which allows long garments to be packed in a condition in which the lower portions of the garments are supported in a condition to avoid substantial wrinkling."
It is the last objective which is particularly relevant for the purposes of this case. The locking trolley to which the registered design relates is the mechanism placed in the top interior of garment bags, on which hangers holding the garments are hung.
