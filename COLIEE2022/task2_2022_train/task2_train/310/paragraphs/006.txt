The analysis articulated by Mr. Justice Owen in Société de développement de la Baie James c. Kanatewat, [1975] C.A. 166, at page 183, was quoted:
"... First the applicant has to convince the court that he appears to be entitled to an interlocutory injunction, that is that the right he is asserting has a reasonable prospect of being recognized by the final judgment. Secondly the applicant, if successful on the first test, then has to show that it is an exceptional case in which an interlocutory injunction is necessary in order to avoid: (i) serious or irreparable injury to the applicant, or (ii) a factual or legal situation of such a nature as to render the final judgment ineffectual.
...
"At the interlocutory injunction stage these [the applicant's] rights are apparently either (a) clear, or (b) doubtful, or (c) nonexistent.
(a) If it appears clear, at the interlocutory stage that the Petitioners have the rights which they invoke then the interlocutory injunction should be granted if considered necessary in accordance with the provisions of the second paragraph of article 752 C.P.
(b) However, if at this stage the existence of the rights invoked by the Petitioners appears doubtful then the court should consider the balance of convenience and inconvenience in deciding whether an interlocutory injunction should be granted.
(c) Finally if it appears, at the interlocutory stage, that the rights claimed are nonexistent then the interlocutory injunction should be refused."
