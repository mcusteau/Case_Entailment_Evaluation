I simply do not accept that there is a presumption that interlocutory injunctions should not be granted in patent cases. I note that the requirement that damages be considered an inadequate remedy is equally a requirement for the granting of a permanent injunction as it is for the granting of one at the interlocutory stage. Yet it has never been doubted that the granting of permanent injunctions is appropriate in patent cases. One can pose the rhetorical question "why have the courts not ordered infringers to simply keep an accounting of all profits in the future and pay those over to the defendant, after the full trial of an issue, rather than granting an injunction"? There may very well be considerations respecting the continual enforcement of such an order but I think the failure to grant such orders is primarily based on the view that damages are not an adequate remedy. If damages are not an adequate remedy after trial, it is equally the case that they are not an adequate remedy at the interlocutory stage. In my view, the basis of the courts' reluctance to grant an interlocutory injunction in patent cases must be found elsewhere. I think that reluctance arises from a hesitation about determining rights (even for a temporary period of time) on less than full evidence. In addition, the balance of convenience may often tip in favour of the defendant because it may be comparatively easier to calculate the damages which a plaintiff will suffer as a result of not granting the injunction than it is to calculate the damages a defendant would suffer should the interlocutory injunction have been wrongly given.
