My conclusion from the disputed facts, in this regard, is that Samsonite did not delay in presenting its claim for infringement. Some of the Samsonite employees did see the "Organizer" bag at the show, but they were salesmen, not persons in charge of watching for patent infringement by competitors. Also, it is not clear that they saw the lower part of the bag which embodies the claims in dispute in this action. The videotape which was produced, showed the "Organizer" bag on display at the show, but with the bottom folded up. The employees of one company do not wander readily into the booths of their competitors, at such shows, even though the purpose of the show is to inform the trade about the luggage that each is presently marketing. It is my view that the Samsonite employees who saw the defendant's "Organizer" at the show, either with or without the bottom folded up, did not report that fact to the appropriate supervisor (it was not their job to look for infringement). It simply does not make sense for the plaintiffs to have known about the alleged infringement for six months and to have done nothing. This is not what the plaintiffs did in the case of another infringing bag about which they knew (the Stradellina bag). There would be no reason for the plaintiffs to delay in such a case. In my view, there was no delay. The plaintiffs acted as soon as they discovered the alleged infringement.
