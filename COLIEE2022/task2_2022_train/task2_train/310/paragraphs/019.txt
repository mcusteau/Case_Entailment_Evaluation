Counsel for the defendant argues that claim 28 is too broad: that it claims more than the invention made because it does not include any reference to a stiffened lower portion of the interior panel. Mr. Nordstrom, a designer employed by the plaintiff, Samsonite Corporation, was asked (cross-examination of January 20, 1988, page 80, question 378) whether wrinkle avoidance would be accomplished by the use of straps (garment holding means) on the interior panel, without that panel being stiffened in any way. He responded: "I believe it would not perform the function intended without the stiffening in the panel". Mr. Palser, Director of Marketing for Samsonite Canada, was asked (cross-examination of January 20, 1988, page 75, questions 272-273) whether it was necessary to have some sort of metal frame or other stiffening means around the lower portions of the interior panel for the invention to work. He responded: "Let's say in my experience it works functionally better if you have a stiffening panel". He was asked: "Would it work at all if you didn't have a stiffening panel, if you simply have a fabric panel?" He answered: "Possibly, I don't know". It is argued by counsel for the defendant that claim 28 does not contain any reference to a stiffening means and therefore is invalid because it lacks utility. I note that even if there is a reasonable likelihood that this argument would prevail at trial, claims 29, 30 and 31 would still be intact and the defendant's garment bags allegedly also infringe those.
