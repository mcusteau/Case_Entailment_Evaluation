Mr. Justice Owen's comments were of course made in reference to article 752 of the Quebec Code Of Civil Procedure. That does not, however, detract from their usefulness. Also, while those comments seem to distinguish between considerations relating to "irreparable harm" and "balance of convenience", those concepts are, in fact, overlapping concepts. Evidence which demonstrates "irreparable harm" will also be relevant to the determination of "balance of convenience". It is difficult to separate the assessment of factors relevant to each. I, therefore, shall deal with these issues together, after having considered "the strength of the plaintiffs' case". It should be noted that the Supreme Court of Canada recently in A.G. of Manitoba v. Metropolitan Stores et al., [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110, at 128-129; 73 N.R. 341; 46 Man.R.(2d) 241, indicated that considerations of "irreparable injury" might alternatively be considered in the context of an assessment of "balance of convenience". It is necessary, then, to consider: (1) the strength of the plaintiffs' case in relation to (2) the irreparable harm and balance of convenience considerations which pertain.
