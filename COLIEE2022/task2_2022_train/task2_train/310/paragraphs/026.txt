In the present case, it is clear that all three garment bags perform the function of preventing bunching at the bottom of the bag. The plaintiffs' "World's Greatest Garment Bag" does so by stiffening the interior panel. The defendant's "Ultimate" and "Organizer" bags do so by adding insert panels (in one case, connected to the back lower seam). This may have improved on the plaintiffs' invention, but, as Mr. Justice Mahoney said in the Varta case, if one can say that the substance of the plaintiffs' patented invention remains in the defendant's innovation, there will still be infringement. After careful consideration, however, it seems more likely than not that the defendant's variant is materially different from the plaintiffs' way of accomplishing the purpose of preventing bunching at the bottom of the bag. It seems more likely than not that the variant is not one "fenced off by the patent", giving that patent a purposive construction.
