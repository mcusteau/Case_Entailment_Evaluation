The second aspect of the applicable law about which much argument revolved in this case is the extent to which there are special rules or considerations which dictate that interlocutory injunctions are not usually given in patent cases. Counsel for the defendant argues that in patent cases it is very rare for interlocutory injunctions to be granted. He argues that, in patent cases, interlocutory injunctions are refused when: (i) the validity or infringement of the patent in issue is disputed; (ii) the patent is of recent origin; (iii) the validity of the patent has not been established by a court decision; (iv) the defendant is willing to keep an accounting of profits, which accounting can lead to an effective compensatory award to the plaintiff after trial [see footnote 1]. All of these circumstances favour not granting an interlocutory injunction in this case.
