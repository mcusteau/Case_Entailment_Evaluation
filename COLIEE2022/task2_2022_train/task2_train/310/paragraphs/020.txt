The defendant argues that claims 28 to 30 make no reference to the corner pockets and therefore are too broadly framed. I do not find this argument convincing. The corner pockets are mentioned elsewhere in the claims. It seems to me the three aspects claimed by the plaintiffs' patent are interrelated so that they can validly exist side by side in one patent, but I was not referred to any jurisprudence which holds that all features of a patent must be mentioned in every claim.
