The Krynoski patent, which issued in 1965, relates to what is called "a folding wardrobe bag ... particularly suitable for use with mens' suits, or other similar relatively short garments". The patent indicates that the bag can also be used for longer garments. The flap (interior panel) carries a pair of retainer flaps which fasten over the bottom of the garments being packed "so as to secure the garment in a manner which is less susceptible to wrinkling than as in the usual type of packing arrangement". The rectangular flaps also serve as a fold line. This patent focusses on short garments and on folding them in the middle. It does not teach the prevention of "bunching" in the bottom of a garment bag. I do not think it likely that it could be held to anticipate the plaintiffs' patent.
