This court does not have jurisdiction to make an order to bind the Crown in right of Ontario. No provision in the Federal Court Act confers jurisdiction on this court to do so, with the exception of s. 19 which is not applicable here. It would be inappropriate to invoke s. 56(1) of the Federal Court Act so as to find jurisdiction in any other statute.
