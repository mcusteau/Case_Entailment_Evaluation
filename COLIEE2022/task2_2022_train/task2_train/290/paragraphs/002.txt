The judgment creditor and the judgment debtor were divorced, and a decree nisi was pronounced on November 30, 1982, by the Supreme Court of Ontario. The judgment debtor has, from time to time, refused to make the full payments required under the order and is in arrears in the amount of $4,400.00 as of May 1, 1986. The judgment creditor is resident of Manitoba and the judgment debtor is resident of Ontario. Pursuant to s. 15 of the Divorce Act and rule 1087(1) of the Federal Court Rules, the decree nisi was registered in the Federal Court of Canada and an application was brought under s. 56(1) of the Federal Court Act and rule 2300(1) of the Federal Court Rules to order that all debts owing or accruing from a third party (garnishee) to the judgment debtor be attached to answer the judgment debt. On Tuesday, January 20, 1986, a garnishee order to show cause was pronounced by Mr. Justice Cullen of this court at its sittings at Winnipeg, Manitoba. A true copy of the garnishee order to show cause was served upon the Crown in the right of Ontario, being a respondent in this matter.
