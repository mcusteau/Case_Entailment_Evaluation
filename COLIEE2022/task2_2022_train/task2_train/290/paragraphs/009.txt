With regard to judgment creditor's second argument that s. 56(1) of the Federal Court Act and the Weniuk case can be used to permit the court to resort by analogy to provincial enforcement mechanisms and make an order binding on the Crown in right of Ontario; as Mr. Justice Muldoon said in Weniuk, the analogy may only occur by way of adaptation of a provincial superior court process. The Federal Court may not adopt provincial processes. In addition, s. 56(1) deals with procedural provisions; the combining of provincial superior court processes with those of the Federal Court would not be sufficient to confer express jurisdiction over the Crown in right of Ontario as a matter of substantive law. The jurisdiction of the Federal Court is entirely statutory and as such the court may only entertain those claims against the Crown that have been provided for by statute law.
