Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is an application for a final garnishee order pursuant to a show cause order of the court dated January 24, 1986. When this application originally came on for hearing April 28, 1986, the Crown in the right of Ontario requested an adjournment in order to prepare written submissions. At issue is whether the Federal Court Trial Division has jurisdiction to make a final garnishee order pursuant to Federal Court Rule 2300 that would be binding on the Crown in the right of Ontario.
