In Canadian Javelin Limited et al. v. The Queen in right of Newfoundland (1977), 77 D.L.R.(3d) 317 (F.C.A.), Chief Justice Jackett stated that where the Federal Court Act contemplates conferring jurisdiction in claims against Her Majesty, it does so by express reference to claims against the "Crown", which is defined, for purposes of the Federal Court Act, by s. 2 as "Her Majesty in right of Canada". In addition, it was held that the Crown cannot be impleaded in a court in respect of a claim against the Crown except where statutory jurisdiction has been conferred on the court to entertain claims against the Crown of a class in which the particular claim falls.
