  In the refusal letter, the visa officer did not grant Jun Yan the seventy units required under the  
 Immigration Regulations, 1978 
 , as amended (SOR/78-172) (the " 
 Regulations 
 "); he only received 61 units. More importantly, because Jun Yan's particular background did not conform to the requirements set out in the NOC for physiotherapist, he was awarded zero units for occupation and zero units for experience in that field. Also, he received zero units for experience as a computer programmer, and zero units under occupation and experience as a computer analyst. Given that he did not have any specific job offer in Canada, these results led to an automatic disqualification under the  
 Regulations 
  unless the visa officer exercised her discretion pursuant to section 11(3) of the said  
 Regulations 
 , which reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 "11(3) A visa officer may 
 
 
 
 (a) issue an immigrant visa to an immigrant who is not awarded the number of units of assessment required by section 9 or 10 or who does not meet the requirements of subsection (1) or (2), or 
 
 
 
 (b) refuse to issue an immigrant visa to an immigrant who is awarded the number of units of assessment required by section 9 or 10. 
 
 
 
 "If, in his opinion, there are good reasons why the number of units of assessment awarded do not reflect the chances of the particular immigrant and his dependants of becoming successfully established in Canada and those reasons have been submitted in writing to, and approved by, a senior immigration officer"
