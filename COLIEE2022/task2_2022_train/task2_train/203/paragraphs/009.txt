  The refusal letter does not contain any reference to this request nor does it give any indication that the visa officer addressed her mind to it. There is no mention of the request in the officer's CAIPS notes. Even the affidavit filed as part of the respondent's record is silent in that respect, no where does the visa officer state that she simply was not satisfied that she should exercise her discretion in favour of the applicant.
