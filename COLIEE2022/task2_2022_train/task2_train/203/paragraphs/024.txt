  Nevertheless, even if at this stage the chance of success of such a request appears very slim, the Court cannot conclude that a visa officer would necessarily refuse to exercise the discretion provided for at section 11(3) of the

 Mobil Oil Canada Ltd. et al. v. Canada-Newfoundland Offshore Petroleum Board 
 , [1994] 1 S.C.R. 202; 163 N.R. 27; 115 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 334; 36 A.P.R. 334, at page 228;  
 Yassine v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1994), 172 N.R. 308; 27 Imm. L.R.(2d) 135 (F.C.A.)). Therefore, the decision must be set aside.
