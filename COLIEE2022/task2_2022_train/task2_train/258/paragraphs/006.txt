The applicant CRDD hearing, the presiding member said this:
"Prior to the hearing, a number of issues were identified as particularly relevant to this claim. I'll deal with those at this time.
"The first issue that was identified was the issue of nexus, whether there's a link between the claim and the Convention refugee definition.
"As in all claims, there's the well-foundedness of the claimant's fear of persecution, which is understood to include whether there's an objective basis to this claim; the agent of persecution; and most significantly, whether state protection is available to the claimant in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Well-foundedness also includes whether there's an internal flight alternative. That is, somewhere in the Island of St. Vincent and the Grenadines where the claimant can go without fear of persecution, and it would be reasonable under circumstances to go there.
"As in all claims before the Board, there's the issue of credibility. That's understood to include delay in claiming and possibly delay in leaving." [see footnote 5]
