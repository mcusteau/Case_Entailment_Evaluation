As stated, knowing how to decide whether to believe a refugee claimant who has suffered domestic violence is critical. Under the heading "D. Special Problems at Determination Hearings", the
Gender Guidelines
clearly point out that:
"Women refugee claimants who have suffered sexual violence may exhibit a pattern of symptoms referred to as Rape Trauma Syndrome, and may require extremely sensitive handling. Similarly, women who have been subjected to domestic violence may exhibit a
pattern of symptoms
referred to as Battered Woman Syndrome and may also be reluctant to testify." [see footnote 13]
