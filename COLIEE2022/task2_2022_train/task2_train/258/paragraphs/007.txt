However, the following statements were also made by the presiding member of the panel during the course of the hearing, and during submissions respectively:
"I think my colleague and I are prepared to accept that the claimant has suffered domestic abuse at the hands of her husband while she was in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. [see footnote 6]
. . . . .
"Counsel, if it will assist you in submissions, I think the panel has made the ruling that we accept that the claimant has been a victim of domestic abuse in St. Vincent at the hands of her husband. I don't think my colleague or I heard anything with respect to the abuse itself that would fatefully [sic?] impugn her credibility. In my opinion, and I think my colleague shares it, the issue of credibility with respect to the abuse suffered at the hands of her husband, will not be determinative of the claim ... We won't determine the claim on the basis of any credibility finding with respect to alleged abuse suffered at the hands of her husband." [see footnote 7]
