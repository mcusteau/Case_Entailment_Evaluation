The applicant, Marion Clotilda Griffith, is a 46 year old citizen of St. Vincent, a small Caribbean island. She came to Canada on 6 June 1992 on a visitor's visa that was valid for three months. The applicant stayed beyond the expiration of the visa and did not make a refugee claim until 25 November 1997. Her claim is based on the state's unwillingness or inability to protect her from spousal abuse. Her husband, the source of the abuse, remains in St. Vincent, and, indeed, has been actively seeking his wife's return. [see footnote 3]
