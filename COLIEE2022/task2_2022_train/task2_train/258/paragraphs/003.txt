In quoting the applicant's story as follows, I am not directing the CRDD on the redetermination to accept the applicant's evidence; it is for members of the panel to make their own findings of fact. Instead, my purpose is to simply stress the point that, in considering a story such as the one the applicant tells and in making a finding of credibility, a decision maker must consider the evidence from the perspective of the teller, and, in particular, give careful consideration to what conduct might be expected of a woman living under the violent conditions described. Indeed, as pointed out below, this is the purpose of the
Gender Guidelines
, which I find to be a positive, enlightened, and necessary effort by the Immigration and Refugee Board to ensure knowledgeable and sensitive consideration of the evidence of women claiming refugee status because of violence within a relationship. A problem in the present case is that, quite apart from the manifest breach of natural justice found, there is no evidence that the
Gender Guidelines
were followed.
