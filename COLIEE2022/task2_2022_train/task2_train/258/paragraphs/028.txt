The pitfall exposed in the statements is that the panel members' interpretation of an "objective" standard is being used as the standard against which the actions of the applicant are being judged; that is, the objective standard of the "reasonable man" so commonly used in criminal and civil law. The issue is not whether men or women are decision makers, but rather whether a male norm is being unfairly applied. About this, Wilson, J., in
Lavallee
at p. 874 [S.C.R.] says this:
"If it strains credulity to imagine what the 'ordinary man' would do in the position of a battered spouse, it is probably because men do not typically find themselves in that situation. Some women do, however. The definition of what is reasonable must be adapted to circumstances which are, by and large, foreign to the world inhabited by the hypothetical 'reasonable man'."
