The "pattern of symptoms" to be expected of women who have been battered is described in the footnote to the quote just cited as follows:
"For a discussion of the battered woman syndrome see
R. v. Lavallee
, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852 [S.C.C.]. In
Lavallee
, Madame Justice Wilson addressed the mythology about domestic violence and phrased the myth as '[e]ither she was not as badly beaten as she claims, or she would have left the man long ago. Or, if she was battered that severely, she must have stayed out of some masochistic enjoyment of it.' The court further indicated that a manifestation of the victimization of battered women is a 'reluctance to disclose to others the fact or extent of the beatings'. In
Lavallee
, the court indicated that expert evidence can assist in dispelling these myths and be used to explain
why a woman would remain in a battering relationship
." (emphasis added) [see footnote 14]
