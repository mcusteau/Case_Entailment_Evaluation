Campbell, J.
: For more than 20 years, while living in the Caribbean, Ms. Griffith suffered violence from her husband. As a consequence, she made a claim of Convention refugee status in Canada, and on 18 August 1998 her application was denied by the Convention Refugee Determination Division (the "CRDD"). [see footnote 1] In the course of the hearing leading to this conclusion, the CRDD represented to the applicant that her credibility was not in issue, and, as a consequence, her counsel presented her case accordingly. For the reasons which follow, the CRDD's decision must be set aside because, contrary to the representation made, the CRDD seriously impugned the applicant's credibility, and, thus, a manifest breach of natural justice has occurred.
