  In the present case, I accept the submission advanced on Mr. Tolu's behalf that the CRDD failed to consider whether the cumulative weight of the treatment he experienced could give rise to a well-founded fear of persecution. This analysis of the cumulative nature of persecution was particularly called for in light of the CRDD's conclusion that Alevi Kurds often face discriminatory practices, and in light of Mr. Tolu's evidence as follows: 
 
 
 
 "RCO If you have been in Turkey for five years since your last detention and the police release you after they realize that you had no political profile, what is your fear? 
 
 
 
 MALE CLAIMANT First of all, if I was not caught and arrested from `94 to `99, I'd consider myself extremely lucky, but that's not an indication that I will not be arrested or detained after that. But living with the fear of I might be arrested, every single day, is equal to being arrested. Perhaps I was not being physically tortured, but while I was on the street, every single day, I was psychologically tortured for thinking that, 'When, next, am I going to be detained?'"
