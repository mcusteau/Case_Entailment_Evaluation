In addition, it appears to me that the adjudicator, in arriving at his decision that no interpreter would be provided in this case, took into account irrelevant considerations. It seems that he was concerned that the applicant would have some advantage because he would hear questions put to him twice, that the interpreter could not make the applicant's testimony any better than the applicant could make it himself, and that the interpreter "would act as a screen between you and us". In my view, the sole issue in determining whether or not there should be an interpreter provided, is whether the applicant is able to understand and communicate in English (or French) in the context of the hearing to be held.
