Rothstein, J.
[orally]: This case involves three court files that have been consolidated for hearing purposes. Court file T-1226-92 is an application for judicial review of a decision of a credible basis tribunal rendered on May 27, 1992, finding that the applicant, who claimed to be a Convention refugee, had no credible basis for his claim. Court file T-1486-92 is an application for judicial review seeking to set aside an exclusion order dated September 11, 1992, against the applicant that followed from the negative credible basis decision in Court file T-1226-92. The third matter, Court file T-1620-92, need not be dealt with for purposes of this decision.
