I would observe that the problem of an applicant hearing questions put to him or her twice will arise whenever an applicant has some ability with English (or French). Some knowledge of English or French, however, is not the test. That an interpreter may act as a screen between an applicant and a panel is also obviously irrelevant to the question of whether an applicant requires an interpreter. Finally, where an interpreter is genuinely required, the evidence should be better because the applicant will have an enhanced opportunity to understand and communicate with the assistance of an interpreter than without one.
