In cases involving interpreters, I think it must be borne in mind that proceedings before immigration tribunals deal with serious issues of law and fact. There is a significant difference between a person being able to understand and communicate in English (or in French) on an elementary basis about his schooling and his work, which would have to be categorized as the most basic use of the language, on the one hand, and being able to understand and communicate in English (or in French) in a formal quasi-judicial proceeding on the other. When credibility is in issue as it is in a credible basis inquiry, the ability of an applicant to communicate adequately assumes increased importance (see
Ming v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1990), 107 N.R. 296; 10 Imm. L.R.(2d) 284 (F.C.A.), at p. 292).
