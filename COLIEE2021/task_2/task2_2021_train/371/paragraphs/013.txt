The jurisprudence under this rule makes it clear that it will only be in rare circumstances that a layperson will be given leave to represent a corporation. In
Guccio Gucci S.p.A. v. Cebuchier et al.
(1988), 25 F.T.R. 235; 23 C.P.R.(3d) 427 (T.D.), Mr. Giles summarized the law:
"Paragraph 300(2) is quite plain. A corporation must be represented by an attorney or solicitor. The Federal Court of Appeal in
Father Don's Natural Products Ltd. v. Canada
(1986), 65 N.R. 62 (F.C.A.) doubted whether there were any jurisdiction in the court to allow an individual to represent a corporation. Prior to the Court of Appeal's recording of doubt, there was at least one case in which an officer was permitted to represent a British Columbia company.
"In
Walt Disney Productions v. Just Kiddies Marketing Inc.
1 C.P.R.(3d) 250, there was evidence that the corporation was in fact impecunious, that the individual was a member of the corporation and that the individual was authorized by the corporation to represent it ... [T]hose [are the] essential preconditions."
