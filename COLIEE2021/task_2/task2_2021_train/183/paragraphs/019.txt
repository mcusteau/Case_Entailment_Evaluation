  The specific language of the warrants of committal specifies that the first federal sentence and the second federal sentence are to be served consecutively to the state sentence. The applicant argues that he would not have agreed to the transfer had he known that the federal sentences would be served consecutively. However, such an argument is moot because at the time of transfer the applicant was facing a life sentence and not a determinate sentence of 25 years. The determinate sentence was established only after the transfer. It is inconsequential whether or not the applicant would have agreed to the transfer knowing the federal sentences would be served consecutively because the determinate state sentence was not even a factor at the time of the transfer.
