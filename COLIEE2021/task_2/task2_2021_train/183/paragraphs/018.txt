  I disagree with the applicant's logic. At the time of his transfer, the applicant was sentenced to an indeterminate state sentence and two federal sentences. Because an indeterminate sentence does not exist in Canada, as a condition of transfer, the applicant was to serve a life sentence. As such, it was irrelevant whether or not the federal sentences would be served consecutively or concurrently. There was no practical impact of the two additional federal sentences, as the applicant had been sentenced to serve life in prison. However, once transferred to Canada, the state of Utah changed the applicant's indeterminate sentence into a determinate sentence of twenty five years. Utah has the right to change the applicant's state sentence. Section 11.1(1) of the  
 Transfer of Offenders Act 
  states that Canada must honour the way in which Utah changes the state sentence.
