The Board committed a reviewable error when it made no specific references to relevant evidence such as the psychological report in its decision. That document was not discussed in the Board's decision, and no valid reasons were given to reject this evidence. The Federal Court clearly stated in the case of
Mladeno v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 66; 74 F.T.R. 161 (T.D.), at paragraphs 10 and 13, that a decision of the Board should not stand when it makes no references to relevant evidence:
"But assuming the board's conclusion in relation to changes in the circumstances in Bulgaria is a significant factor in its ultimate decision, as I believe it to be, then the board clearly ought to have considered the letter from the applicant's parents, giving it such weight as the board might determine in assessing whether the change in circumstances since the applicant left Bulgaria affected his claim to fear persecution were he to return. The decision does not show in any way that the letter was considered.
. . . . .
"In my view, the evidence here of concern, in particular the letter from the applicant's parents, whatever weight the board might assign to it, on its face has relevance to at least two of these principal reasons relied on by the board, the second and the third, the cumulative assessment of his fear of persecution and the issue of change in country circumstances. It would not be consistent, in my view, with the principles of fairness applicable to the operations of the CRDD that a decision should stand when it makes no reference to relevant evidence proffered in the letters submitted before the decision, leaving the applicant and this Court uncertain whether or not that evidence was considered at all"
