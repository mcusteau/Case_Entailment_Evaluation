, above, the Court discussed the question of state protection and IFA in the context of domestic violence in St. Vincent in the following terms, at paragraphs 14-15:
"During the course of the oral hearing before me, counsel for the respondent submitted that the questions respecting the applicant's credibility did not affect the outcome of the CRDD hearing since the ultimate decision reached was that the applicant has an available internal flight alternative ('IFA') which she did not use. I rejected this argument from the bench because a finding that an IFA is viable, attainable, and accessible depends on a full understanding of the applicant's condition, which requires a proper assessment of the applicant's credibility.
"The story the applicant has to tell about her abuse and the action she took, or did not take as a result, is only part of what is required to substantiate her refugee claim; the other part is the knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity that the CRDD must possess in order to properly assess the applicant's story. That is, the answer to the question of whether a potential option is an IFA for the applicant must include a very careful and informed analysis of whether it is reasonable from the applicant's perspective, given the state of her mind and the condition of her existence resulting from the abuse. The claimant is the only one who can tell the story; knowing how to decide whether to believe her is critical."
