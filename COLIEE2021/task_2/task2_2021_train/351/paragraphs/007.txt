A removal order was delivered to the applicant's last known address in May 1993, but it did not come to his attention as he had already left the country. On August 13, 1993, the applicant sent a letter to the immigration department from Pakistan, confirming his departure and requesting a refund of the $2,000 cash bond which he had posted. The applicant believed that he had fulfilled the requirements of the exclusion order by remaining in Pakistan for a 12 month period and was therefore eligible to receive the posted bond's face value.
