The respondent's very decision, which the applicant would impugn, can be found copied at tabs 2 and 3, pp. 6 and 7 of the applicant's record (AR), addressed to the applicant's solicitor, thus:
"DAVID: THE ISSUE OF WHETHER A PERSON SUBJECT TO AN EXCLUSION ORDER WHO LEAVES CANADA ON HIS OWN, WITHOUT INFORMING IMMIGRATION, HAS EXECUTED THE ORDER HAS BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE MERCIER AND BHANWAN DECISIONS OF THE FEDERAL COURT, ACCORDING TO THE COURT, A PERSON UNDER A DEPORTATION ORDER OR AN EXCLUSION ORDER WHO LEAVES CANADA WITHOUT HAVING FIRST OBTAINED THE LEAVE OF THE MINISTER, AS REQUIRED BY A52(1) HAS
NOT
EXECUTED THE REMOVAL ORDER IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES THEREFORE OF MR. RAZA. IT IS (AND WILL BE) OUR POSITION THAT SUBJECT'S REMOVAL ORDER HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTED AND DETENTION, IF CONTINUED, WILL BE FOR REMOVAL.
TO THAT END THEREFORE, WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT YOU SURRENDER MR. RAZA'S EXPIRED PASSPORT AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE, IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN OUR EFFORTS AT OBTAINING A VALID TRAVEL DOCUMENT." (AR, p. 6 and p. 7)
