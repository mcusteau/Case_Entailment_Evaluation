More recently, Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer, relying on
TÃ©treault-Gadoury
held that this court, on an application for judicial review, cannot rule on constitutional questions when the federal board whose decision is being reviewed does not have the power to rule on the constitutionality of its enabling statute. In
Gwala v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1998), 147 F.T.R. 246 (T.D.), Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer held a senior immigration officer lacks the power to decide the constitutional validity of the
Immigration Act
and thus, she held in paragraph [22], the only way for an applicant to challenge the constitutionality of certain sections of the
Immigration Act
is to proceed by way of action, rather than by application. The learned judge, however, came to an alternative conclusion in paragraphs [23] et seq. which this court respectfully adopts.
