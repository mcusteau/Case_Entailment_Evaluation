As a preliminary matter, counsel for the respondent raised the question as to whether this court has jurisdiction to hear the constitutional argument raised by the applicant. The respondent asserts that the constitutionality of s. 44(1) must be raised by way of action, not by way of application for judicial review under s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
