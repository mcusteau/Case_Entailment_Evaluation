On February 1, 1992, s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
came into effect. This new section has the effect of expanding both the scope of judicial review and the remedies available. In particular, subs. (3)(b) provides that on an application for judicial review, the court may:
"(b)
declare invalid
or unlawful, or quash or set aside and refer back for determination in accordance with such directions as it considers to be appropriate, prohibit or restrain, a decision, order, act or proceeding of a federal board, commission or other tribunal." (emphasis not in original text)
