  I am satisfied that, in the present case the issues raised by the Applicant in rebuttal were of such a fundamental character that they should have been clearly considered by the Commission and a further or better investigation ordered or clear reasons set out by the Commission in its decision as to why it did not do so. To simply say that the Report is the Commission's reasons would be to ignore the rebuttal entirely.
