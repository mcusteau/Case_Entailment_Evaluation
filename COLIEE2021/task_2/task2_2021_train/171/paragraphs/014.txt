  This, however, does not address the problem that arises when the rebuttal to the report raises serious issues as to what was said or not said in the report or how the investigation was conducted. This was the situation commented upon by Justice Mactavish of this Court in  
 Sanderson v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2006), 290 F.T.R. 83; 2006 FC 447 at paragraphs 77 and 78: 
 
 
 
 "77. It may be that had the Commission looked into Ms. Sanderson's allegations, it might have determined that there is no substance to any of them. However, we have no way of knowing whether this was the case, as there is nothing in the record to suggest that any examination of Ms. Sanderson's allegations was ever carried out by the Commission prior to the decision being made to dismiss Ms. Sanderson's complaint. 
 
 
 
 "78. The serious allegations made by Ms. Sanderson required consideration by the Commission. The failure of the Commission to address these concerns is a further reason why I am of the view that it would be unsafe to allow the decision of the Commission to stand."
