  If the officer's determination was based on a "serious issue of the applicant's credibility" it is accepted that in Ms. Ferguson's circumstances, as otherwise found by the officer, he ought to have conducted an oral hearing. For the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the officer made no error and an oral hearing was not required under the Act or Regulations.
