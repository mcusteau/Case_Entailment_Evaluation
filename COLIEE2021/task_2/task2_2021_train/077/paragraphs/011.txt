  The Applicant submitted that while the officer did not explicitly state that the decision was one of credibility, it could not be anything other than credibility. In the Applicant's submission, the officer did not believe her counsel's statement that she is an open lesbian. Her counsel writes in the memorandum of argument: "Whether because the Applicant had failed to produce sufficient evidence on the balance of probabilities, or for any other reason, the PRRA officer has not believed the statement that the Applicant is a lesbian". This, it is submitted, is essentially a finding of credibility that attracts the requirement to hold a hearing under section 167 of the Regulations. The Applicant further submits that the PRRA officer did not explain why the statement provided by the Applicant's former counsel was insufficient evidence or what evidence the officer did rely on to refute the statement that she was lesbian.
