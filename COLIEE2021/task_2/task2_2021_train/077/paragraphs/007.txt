  Ms. Ferguson submits that the basis for the PRRA officer's determination rejecting the application was her credibility and accordingly, pursuant to section 113 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27, an oral hearing should have been held. Subsection 113(a) provides that "a hearing may be held if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required". The prescribed factors for determining whether a hearing is to be held are set out in section 167 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
 , SOR/2002-227: 
 
 
 
 167. For the purpose of determining whether a hearing is required under paragraph 113( 
 b 
 ) of the Act, the factors are the following: 
 
 
 
 ( 
 a 
 ) whether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility and is related to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act; 
 
 
 
 ( 
 b 
 ) whether the evidence is central to the decision with respect to the application for protection; and 
 
 
 
 ( 
 c 
 ) whether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection.
