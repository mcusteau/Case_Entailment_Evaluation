  Accepting that counsel may submit evidence directly to the PRRA officer, the question will always remain, as it does for all tendered evidence, as to the degree of weight to be given to that evidence. As with all evidence tendered by an applicant in an administrative proceeding, the weight to be given to statements will depend very much on the nature of the statement, the materiality of the fact stated to the matters in issue, and the nature of the proceeding itself. A statement from counsel as to the client's sexual orientation is entitled to be given no more and no less weight than if it were made in an unsworn statement by the Applicant herself.
