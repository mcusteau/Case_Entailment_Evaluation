  It is common ground between the parties that if all of the requirements of that section are met, then a hearing should be held by the officer. It is also common ground that the officer's decision establishes that the requirements in subsections (b) and (c) were met. The issue is whether the requirements set out in subsection 167(a) were met. The Applicant's position is that they were; the officer's rejection of her application was based on the rejection of her evidence that she was openly lesbian, and thus the decision rested on her credibility. The Respondent takes the position that the decision was not based on credibility, but rather on a finding that there was insufficient evidence presented to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that Ms. Ferguson was openly lesbian. In fact, in her written submission, the Respondent's counsel takes the position that there was no evidence before the PRRA officer regarding Ms. Ferguson's sexual orientation to doubt or believe, as her counsel's submission in this regard was not evidence.
