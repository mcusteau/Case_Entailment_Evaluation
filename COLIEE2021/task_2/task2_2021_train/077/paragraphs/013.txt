  In response, the Applicant submitted that it is common practice for immigration counsel to file written submissions on behalf of clients which include statements of evidence, and that there is nothing in either the Act or Regulations or in the policy and procedures of the Respondent that would indicate that such evidence is not to be considered. It is further submitted that the letter from Citizenship and Immigration Canada advising Ms. Ferguson of her right to apply for a Pre-removal Risk Assessment states that information in written submissions will be considered by the PRRA officer. That form letter contains the following paragraph:
