The applicant served in the RCMP from August 21, 1964 to August 21, 1975. During his service he was required to take firearms training and at the time he left the RCMP in 1975, there was no record of any problem with his hearing. The applicant and his wife stated that he had started having hearing problems in 1969, but this had not been communicated to the RCMP. On December 8, 1992, the applicant made his first application for pension entitlement due to hearing loss. The application was made on the basis that his hearing loss was caused by his exposure to excessive noise from firearms during his period of RCMP service. In pursuing his pension, he submitted an audiology report dated December 7, 1992. On February 10, 1994, the Canadian Pension Commission decided that the applicant's hearing loss was not pensionable as the condition did not arise out of or was directly connected with his RCMP service.
