There is one sentence in the Board's decision which is ambiguous. It reads "unless an appellant is able to demonstrate that the facts before the Board are not the same as those upon which the guidelines were elaborated, the Board feels compelled to follow the guidelines.". The applicant submits that this means that the Board considered facts beyond the Guidelines; however there are apparently none in existence. Even taking into account ss. 3 and 39 of the
Veteran's Review and Appeal Board Act
, in my view the Board is saying that the applicant produced no evidence to show he satisfies the Guidelines. The onus is on the applicant to show that his case meets the Guidelines and have a doctor address the concerns set out in Guidelines. Alternatively, he must have a doctor set out in a medical report the reasons why the Guidelines may not be applicable in this particular case. There is no breach of procedural fairness by the Board in the case before me.
