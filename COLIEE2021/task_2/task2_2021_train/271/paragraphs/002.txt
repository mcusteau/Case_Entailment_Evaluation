The applicant is a 19 year old citizen of Albania. He claims a well-founded fear of persecution based on his fear of being murdered in blood feud involving his family and the Curri family. This feud results from his grandfather's murder of a member of the Curri family. This murder was an act of revenge because the Curri kinsmen had killed his grandfather's first cousin. These events occurred in the village of Grude in Montenegro before World War II and prior to the birth of the applicant's father.
