In
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321; 103 D.L.R.(4th) 1, it was determined that "persecution" includes situations where the state is not an accomplice to the persecution but is simply unable to protect its citizens. In such circumstances, the Applicant must provide clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect, unless the state admits that it is unable to protect the citizen.
