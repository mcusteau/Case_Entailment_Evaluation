Again, reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward
, supra, is helpful. In that decision, the Court considered the meaning to be given to the words "particular social group". At page 739, Mr. Justice La Forest said as follows:
"The meaning assigned to 'particular social group' in the
Act
should take into account the general underlying themes of the defence of human rights and anti-discrimination that form the basis for the international refugee protection initiative. ... They identify three possible categories:
'(1) groups defined by an inmate or unchangeable characteristics;
'(2) groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and
'(3) groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence.'
"The first category would embrace individuals fearing persecution on such bases as gender, linguistic background and sexual orientation, while the second would encompass, for example, human rights activists. The third branch is included more because of historical intentions, although it is also relevant to the anti-discrimination influences, in that one's past is an immutable part of the person."
