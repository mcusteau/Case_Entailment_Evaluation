This decision was followed by Mr. Justice Rothstein in
Klinko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 561; 148 F.T.R. 69 (T.D.), where the learned Judge made the following finding:
"Insofar as the family group is concerned (and this social group is the bases for the Convention refugee claim of Andriy as well as Lyudmyla) the panel was correct in concluding that when the primary victim of persecution doe snot come within the Convention refugee definition, any derivative Convention refugee claim based on family group cannot sustained. Otherwise, as found by the Panel, the anomaly of derivative claims being allowed but primary claims being denied could result. Such a result would not be a logical (See:
Rodriguez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(26 September 1997), IMM-4573-96 (F.C.T.D.), per Heald, D.J."
