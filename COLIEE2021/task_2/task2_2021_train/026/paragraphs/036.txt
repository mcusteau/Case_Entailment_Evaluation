  Regarding the first question, the Court previously determined the age factor between spouses is a relevant one ( 
 Strulovits 
 ;  
 Khera 
 ). Regarding the second question, the Federal Court of Appeal has previously ruled in the matter  
 Ramsahoye v. Minister of Employment and Immigration  
 (1994), 170 N.R. 157; 47 A.C.W.S.(3d) 1301 (F.C.A.) that not only is the age factor a relevant one but that it does not engage section 15 of the  
 Charter 
 . This Court is accordingly of the view that the questions proposed for certification do not raise any issues of general importance. Accordingly, they shall not be certified.
