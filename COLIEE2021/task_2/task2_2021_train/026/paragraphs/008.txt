  Hammad Hamid left Pakistan in 2001 for the United States with his mother, his brother Abdullah and his sister. His brother Waqas later met up with them in the United States. Hammad Hamid remained in the United States after the expiration of his six month visa but he never requested refugee protection. Fearing a backlash after the events of 9/11 and the possibility they would be sent back to Pakistan, the three brothers came to Canada. Waqas arrived on May 14, 2003 and requested refugee protection. Hammad and Abdullah arrived in June 2003 and requested refugee protection. Their claim was heard on November 6, 2003.
