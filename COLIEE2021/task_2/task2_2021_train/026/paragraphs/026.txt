  In the present case, the Applicant argued that there exists contradictory jurisprudence on the issue of whether the age difference is a relevant factor in determining whether the marriage is genuine ( 
 Siev v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 455; 144 A.C.W.S.(3d) 1095; 2005 FC 736,  
 Khan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 843; 143 A.C.W.S.(3d) 736; 2005 FC 1372,

 , [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 344; 148 A.C.W.S.(3d) 467; 2006 FC 565 at para. 14-17 and  
 Khera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2007] F.T.R. Uned. 431; 158 A.C.W.S.(3d) 813; 2007 FC 632,  
 Strulovits v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2009] F.T.R. Uned. 259; [2009] F.C.J. No. 516; 2009 FC 435). The Applicant relies principally on the ruling made in  
 Khan 
 . However, this case is distinguishable given that it was decided in the absence of an interview to determine the legitimacy of the marriage. Such an interview was held in the circumstances at bar. I agree with the analysis of my colleague Justice Snider in  
 Singh 
  at paragraphs 14-16, where she distinguished the  
 Khan 
  case on this basis as follows: 
 
 
 
 "The Applicant did not have an oral hearing or interview with the Officer. He submits that the Officer breached her duty of procedural fairness by considering the evidence relating to the genuineness of the relationship without the benefit of an interview. In this argument, the Applicant relies on  
 Khan v. Canada 
  ( 
 Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 ), 2005 FC 1372, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1688 (QL), where the Court determined that, since the officer had doubts about the marriage's legitimacy, it should have granted the applicant an interview to allow him 'meaningful participation' in defending his relationship (esp. at paras. 20 & 26). The Applicant asks that similar reasoning be applied here. 
 
 
 
 "The Supreme Court in  
 Baker, 
  above at para. 34, stated clearly that an interview is not a general requirement for H & C decisions. The opportunity to produce full and complete written documentation in relation to all aspects of the application was held, in  
 Baker 
 , to satisfy the requirements of participatory rights required by the duty of fairness. The Applicant agreed that, in most cases, an interview is not required. 
 
 
 
 "As interpreted by the Applicant,  
 Khan 
  would stand for the proposition that an interview is required whenever the legitimacy of a marriage or common law relationship is questioned. This interpretation ignores  
 Baker 
  and cannot be correct.  
 Khan 
  must be read in light of its facts. In my view, the facts in this case are not comparable to those in  
 Khan 
 , where the factors relied on by the officer were highly speculative or irrelevant."
