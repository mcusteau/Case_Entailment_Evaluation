 [21] 
  The Board concluded the Applicant failed to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the relationship is genuine and that it was not entered into primarily to acquire a status or privilege under the  
 Act 
 . The Board based its decision on the following factors: 
 
 
 
 "(a) there are many differences between the Applicant and Hammad Hamid, such as the age difference of almost 25 years, the language difference, the different religions and the fact they have little in common; 
 
 
 
 "(b) Hammad Hamid married a woman who is of another faith, is significantly older and unchaste by Pakistani standards, which is inconsistent with the norms of his culture and he has not disclosed his marriage to his family in Pakistan; 
 
 
 
 "(c) the marriage was decided upon after Hammad Hamid exhausted all over avenues to come to Canada and the fact the marriage represents an 'insurance' against his removal from Canada; 
 
 
 
 "(d) the Applicant will likely not be able to bear another child, given her age, did not give Hammad second thoughts about entering into the marriage, although he testified he would probably want to have children in the future; 
 
 
 
 "(e) Hammad Hamid did not invite his employer, Pascal Lebrun to his wedding, nor did he inform him about the marriage. The Board expected that in a genuine relationship, Hammad Hamid would have publicized what should have been the happiest day of his life."
