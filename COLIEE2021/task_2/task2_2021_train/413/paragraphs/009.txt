I have considered carefully the implications of the recent Federal Court of Appeal decision in
Kellogg Salada Canada Inc. v. Registrar of Trademarks and Maximum Nutrition Ltd.
[See 145 N.R. 131.] which has been issued since the present appeal was argued before me. Reversing my decision in that case, the Court of Appeal found evidence of the state of the register there to be highly relevant and held that (as I understand it), combined with other direct evidence of use, it demonstrated no likelihood of confusion arising from the appellant's trademark. I have also noted the recent decision of that court in
Park Avenue Furniture Corp. v. Wickes/Simmons Bedding Ltd.
(1991), 130 N.R. 223; 37 C.P.R.(3d) 413, where it also relied on state of the register evidence.
