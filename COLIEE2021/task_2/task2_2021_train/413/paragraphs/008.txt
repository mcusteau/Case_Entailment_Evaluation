It should first be noted that by the very words of s. 16(3)(b) of the
Trade-marks Act
the relevant date for testing confusion with a trademark (like the opponent's) for which registration has previously been filed is the application date for the later trademark: in this case August 28, 1985. Thus the tenth trademark exhibited in the new McDonald affidavit is irrelevant. With respect to the other nine the evidence is not significantly different from that before the hearing member. The formal registrations do not assist me further in knowing what use was being made of these marks at the relevant date.
