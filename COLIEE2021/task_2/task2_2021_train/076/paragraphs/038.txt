  The applicant further submits that the Board made no mention of the applicant's psychological state in the context of the IFA. I do not accept this argument. While an extensive analysis of her psychological state was not performed, the Board clearly stated that the psychological report was considered. The Board also stated that it did not consider that it would be unduly harsh to require the applicant to relocate. For these reasons I do not believe that the Board committed a reviewable error.
