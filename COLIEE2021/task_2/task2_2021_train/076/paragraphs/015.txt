  The applicant argues that the Board merely made a blanket statement without specifically addressing the evidence that suggests that protection for abused women in Mexico can be less than forthcoming. In particular, the applicant submits that evidence in the National Documentation Package indicates that the mechanisms in place to assist women seeking protection are not effective. The applicant submits that by ignoring an article from Human Rights Watch in 2006, the Board's error is twofold: the Board failed to give reasons as to why the evidence that state protection is available to the applicant was preferred to contradictory sources, and the Board failed to engage in an analysis of the effectiveness of the mechanisms of state protection available abused women.
