  The applicant submits that psychological harm may constitute persecution under section 96 of the Act, and cruel or unusual treatment under section 97. This argument has no basis in law. As stated by Russell J. in  
 Nadjat v. Canada (minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.C.J. No. 478, 2006 FC 302 at paragraphs 60-61: 
 
 
 
 This would mean that, under 97(1)(b), subjective fear could, even if groundless on an objective basis, constitute objective fear if the Applicant is so fearful of non-objective risks that his health is deteriorating. 
 
 
 
 I do not believe this is the purpose of, or intent behind, section 97(1)(b). The Applicant's position is that the removal itself can trigger the application of 97(1)(b) irrespective of the objective risks that he faces in Iran.  
 In effect this would mean that the Applicant could qualify under section 97(1)(b) if he is at risk from himself and his own fears, no matter how lacking in objectivity those fears actually are. I do not believe that the scheme of the Act, the intention of section 97(1)(b), or the jurisprudence concerning the need for objective risk when considering section 97 allow for such a conclusion. 
  I believe the Officer handled the medical evidence appropriately and assessed the risk under section 97(1)(b) in accordance with the jurisprudence of this Court. 
 
 
 
 It has also been decided in  
 Nadjat 
  at paras 60-61, that risk of traumatisation is not sufficient to constitute an objective basis of risk.
