  The claim was rejected by the Board for two reasons. First the Board determined that the applicant did not have a well founded fear because state protection was available to her for the following reasons: 
 
 
 
 A. While the documentary evidence acknowledges crime, corruption and widespread domestic abuse in Mexico, the Board found that the government has taken steps to address the problem. There are legislative, enforcements and correctional institutions in the various levels of government to protect victims of domestic abuse. The Board relied on the existence of criminal and civil laws dealing with family-related matters, as well as several public and private programs and institutions in place to assist women and victims of violence. 
 
 
 
 B. Mexico is a functioning democracy, and therefore the presumption of state protection applies. Mexico has national and local police forces, and an independent judiciary. 
 
 
 
 C. The applicant did not exhaust all reasonable courses of action available to her. Local failures to provide effective policing do not amount to an absence of state protection. The Board did not find it reasonable for the applicant to report the abuse to the police only once, given her level of education and her professional standing. The Board noted that she did not seek medical attention, or secure witnesses in order to substantiate her rape. She also failed to seek legal advice.
