 B. Did the Board err by failing to consider the particular circumstances of the applicant in the assessment of whether an internal flight alternative (IFA) was available to the applicant? 
 
 
 
 C. Did the Board err in such a way as to deny the applicant's right to natural justice by failing to address the central argument relating to the applicant's psychological state?
