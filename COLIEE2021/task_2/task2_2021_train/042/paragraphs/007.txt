  The Board goes on to make a most disturbing finding. In the absence of stating that the Applicants' evidence is not credible, the Board concludes that it "gives more weight to the documentary evidence because it comes for (sic) reputable, knowledgeable sources, none of whom have any interest in the outcome of this particular refugee hearing". This statement is tantamount to stating that documentary evidence should always be preferred to that of a refugee claimant's because the latter is interested in the outcome of the hearing. If permitted, such reasoning would always defeat a claimant's evidence. The Board's decision in this case does not inform the reader why the Applicants' evidence, when supposed to be presumed true (Adu, supra), was considered suspect. Further, this reasoning cannot even stand on the facts of this case.
