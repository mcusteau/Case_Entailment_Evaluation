With regard to the CAIPS, the departmental computer based system, and the alleged, improper delegation, or fettering, of discretion, I note that it has been held that the CCDO is "... a binding system of classification and assessment." [see footnote 17] As a result, visa officers are bound by the CCDO definitions and may not substitute their own criteria for a given occupation. In the recent case of
Lakhani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [see footnote 18] Heald, D.J., in refusing to certify a question on whether visa officers can delegate their authority to CAIPS, held that CAIPS "... is simply an administrative procedure whereby the visa officer employs a processing system to assist her in making her assessment of the applicant." In my view, there is no reviewable error where a visa officer uses CAIPS to arrive at an assessment figure for specific vocational preparation (SVP).
