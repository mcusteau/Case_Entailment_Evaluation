In my opinion, this notice of a pending unfavourable decision gave the applicant and his immigration consultant an opportunity to change the applicant's intended occupation, even in the absence of the SVP units of assessment. In fact, as noted above, the immigration consultant did write to the High Commission on August 9, 1996, to reiterate his own assessment of the applicant's point total and to present his own arguments concerning the points total that should be awarded to the applicant under the occupation "assistant manager, retail". I cannot agree with the applicant, therefore, that the officer erred in not making explicit the SVP units of assessment prior to her formal decision. There was in my view no procedural unfairness in this respect in the process followed by the officer dealing with the application. Procedural fairness does not oblige a visa officer, in weighing evidence provided by the applicant, "... to accord an applicant a 'running score' or a penultimate comment on his 'score'". [see footnote 15] I would add to this position the view set out in
Yu
that there is no requirement for notice of an officer's concerns where these arise directly from the
Act
and
Regulations
that the officer is bound to follow in his or her assessment of the applicant.
