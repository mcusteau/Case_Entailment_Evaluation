In
Li v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [see footnote 5] Jerome, A.C.J., followed his earlier ruling in
Hajariwala v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
[see footnote 6] in holding that
"... there exists a clear responsibility on the part of the visa officer to assess alternate occupations inherent in the applicant's work experience where the applicant seeks such an assessment by designating it in his application. Where his work experience suggests that the occupation may be appropriate, the visa officer must assess the applicant in the designated occupation, regardless of which alternate occupations the officer has seen fit to consider."
More recently, in
Cai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [see footnote 7] Pinard, J., held that
"In making his or her assessment, the visa officer is not only called upon to compare the applicant's experience and qualifications with those set out in Schedule I of the
Regulations
, but is also obliged to consider the applicant under every occupation he or she designates in his or her application, and is also vested with the 'clear responsibility ... to assess alternate occupations inherent in the applicant's work experience'."
Finally, in
Asghar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [see footnote 8] Muldoon, J., had occasion to discuss visa officer duties to assess alternate occupations. Having examined the principles set out above, he stated that
"... where the applicant has not indicated a listed occupation, the question is, rather, whether a particular occupation is 'inherent' in his work experience; therefore there must be evidence on the record that indicates that the applicant is qualified to pursue those occupations, otherwise the visa officer cannot be faulted for his failure to consider those occupations."
