It is well settled that the Immigration Manual guidelines do not fetter the discretion of visa officers. The Federal Court of Appeal in
Mohammad (M.M.I.) v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
[see footnote 1], held that "Insofar as the Department's policy directives are concerned, the
Martineau
(No.1) case has established that policy directives, whether made pursuant to regulatory authority or general administrative capacity, are no more than directions and are unenforceable by members of the public." Similarly, in
Vidal and Dadwah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, Mr. Justice Strayer (as he was then) wrote that he was
"... satisfied that these guidelines adequately convey to immigration officers that, particularly in respect of humanitarian and compassionate considerations, the guidelines are not to be regarded as exhaustive and definitive. It is emphasized and reemphasized that officers are expected to use their best judgment." [see footnote 2]
The role of the guidelines, nonbinding and not exhaustive, as guidance for the exercise of discretion is reaffirmed in recent cases. [see footnote 3] In
Vidal
, Strayer, J., discussing the specific case of humanitarian and compassionate guidelines, wrote that
"... it must follow as a corollary of the reasoning of Jerome, A.C.J., in
Yhap
that an applicant cannot complain if an immigration officer fails or refuses to follow the Minister's guidelines. Nor can he complain if an immigration officer applies any factor in lieu of those in the guidelines as long as this is done in good faith and the factor is not wholly irrelevant to any conceivable view of humanitarian and compassionate considerations."
