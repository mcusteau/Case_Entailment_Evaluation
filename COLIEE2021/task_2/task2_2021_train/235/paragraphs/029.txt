In my opinion, in light of these authorities, considering "flexibility" under the heading of Factor 9, personal suitability, is not a reviewable error. Moreover, here the visa officer did not consider matters of "flexibility" that were not also indicative of "initiative", a specified criterion under Factor 9. In this regard, in her affidavit, the visa officer indicates that the applicant
"... failed to show any evidence of initiative or flexibility at the interview. He knew very little about the job he had been offered in Canada and certainly nothing of the nature of the store where he hoped to work and had made no efforts to find out. He had never operated a cash register and the bookkeeping at his present place of employment was done by an accountant. He had also demonstrated his lack of initiative by failing to complete a commerce course he had done for a year or take further studies."
In my view, all these examples of the applicant's behaviour may be considered as examples of a lack of initiative or of a lack of flexibility, as I understand the common meaning of these words and the last sentence quoted of the visa officer's assessment refers to the applicant's educational shortcomings as "also demonstrating a lack of initiative".
