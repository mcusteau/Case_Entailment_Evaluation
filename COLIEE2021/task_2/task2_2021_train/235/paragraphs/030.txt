As for considering education as a criterion of personal suitability,
Stefan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
[see footnote 13] stands for the proposition that "What must be seen in an analysis under personal suitability is an assessment focused on the four Factors and not on the skill level already recorded in other parts of the assessment". Yet, as Madame Justice Simpson ruled in that case education can be relevant under Factor 9 so long as it is looked at from a different perspective than when it is assessed as an independent factor. I agree with this view.
