[121]
I analogize the situation to one of an injury that a person may have suffered by the tortious activity of another person. For instance, a person may be injured in the leg so that, for the rest of that person's life, that person suffers a leg disability. The leg may heal, the person perhaps ought to have sought, but did not, medical attention or remedial therapy. These are matters of quantification and not a matter of injury itself.
