The Supreme Court of Canada in
City National Leasing Ltd. v. General Motors of Canada Ltd.
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 641; 93 N.R. 326; 32 O.A.C. 332; 24 C.P.R.(3d) 417 considered similar circumstances. There the question was whether, under the
Combines Investigation
Act
as it then was the federal government could, under its powers respecting trade and commerce, provide for a civil cause of action which could be taken by one individual against another for breach of certain provisions of that
Act
. The unanimous decision of the Court was delivered by Dickson, J. At page 436, he recognized that in a federal system it is inevitable that, in pursuing valid objectives, the legislation of each level of government will impact occasionally on the sphere of power of the other level of government; overlap of legislation is to be expected and accommodated in a federal state. He encouraged judicial restraint in proposing strict tests which would result in striking down such legislation.
