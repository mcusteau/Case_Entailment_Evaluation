[107]
Subsection 8(1)(a) provides that the period of compensation shall end, in this case, on the date of dismissal. Here that date is May 26, 2005, the date that this Court in T-844-03 dismissed Merck's application. There was no appeal. No provision is made in that subsection for any discretion in the Court to choose another date.
