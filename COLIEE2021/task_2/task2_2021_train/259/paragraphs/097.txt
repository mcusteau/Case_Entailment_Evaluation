Turning to section 8(4) of the
PMNOC Regulations
it is immediately apparent that the generic is not a patentee, in fact it escaped charges of infringement of somebody else's patent by demonstrating that the patent was invalid (as in the present case) or not infringed. The generic cannot claim damages or an account of profits
for infringement
. What the generic can claim is "compensation" for "loss" having been kept off the market for a period of time. That "compensation" takes the form of "damages or profits". The reasonable interpretation of those words "damages or profits" is that the generic can seek, as a measure of its damages in the alternative, the profits that it would have made if it had been able to market its product at an earlier time.
