Apotex's claim is set out in paragraph 1. (a)(ii) of its Further Amended Statement of Claim as follows:
"1. The Plaintiff, Apotex Inc. ('Apotex'), claims:
(a) damages suffered by Apotex in respect of the drug alendronate by reason of the commencement of a proceeding by the Defendants pursuant to the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
(the '
Patent Regulations
'), in respect of:
. . . . .
(ii) lost sales and permanent market share due to the fact that launch by Apotex of its alendronate product was unjustly delayed with the result that two other generic manufacturers, Novopharm Limited ('Novopharm') and Cobalt Pharmaceuticals Inc. ('Cobalt'), launched their alendronate products essentially simultaneously, thus denying Apotex the opportunity to establish as permanent market share advantage in advance of any generic competitor."
