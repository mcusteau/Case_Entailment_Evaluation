Having regard to all of the foregoing discussion, including but not limited to what Professor Sullivan has said, I conclude that the proper interpretation of section 8(4) of the
PMNOC Regulations
is to find that the words "damages or profits" are to be interpreted to include only "compensation" for the "loss", if any, suffered by a generic, and that those words do not provide for a right of a generic to elect for a disgorgement or account of a first person's profits.
