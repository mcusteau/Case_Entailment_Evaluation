Lederman, J., of the Ontario Superior Court in
Bayer Aktiengesellschaft et al. v. Apotex Inc.
, [2001] O.T.C. 2; 10 C.P.R.(4th) 151 (Sup. Ct.), affd. (2002), 155 O.A.C. 117; 16 C.P.R.(4th) 417 (C.A.) and as cited by Snider, J., in
JAY-LOR
, supra, at paragraph 114, said at paragraph 12 of
Bayer
:
"12. The remedy of an accounting of profits is equitable in origin and its goal is compensatory. The purpose is not to punish the defendant for its wrongdoing:
Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet Oy
(1994), 55 C.P.R.(3d) 433 at 455 (F.C.T.D.), var'd on other grounds (1995), 61 C.P.R.(3d) 271 (F.C.A.);
Lubrizol Corp. v. Imperial Oil Ltd.
(1996), 71 C.P.R.(3d) 26 at 33 (F.C.A.). Like an award of damages, an accounting of profits is designed to compensate the patentee for the wrongful use of its property. While the goal of each remedy is the same, the underlying principles are very different. An award of damages seeks to compensate the plaintiff for any losses suffered by the plaintiff as a result of the infringement. The amount of profits earned by the infringing party is irrelevant. An accounting of profits, on the other hand, aims to disgorge any profits improperly received by the defendant as a result of its wrongful use of the plaintiff's property. Such profits, having been earned through the use of the plaintiff's property, rightly belong to the plaintiff. The aim is to remedy the unjust enrichment of the defendant by transferring these profits to their rightful owner, the patentee:
Beloit Canada Ltd. v. Valmet Oy
(1994), supra, at p. 455 (F.C.T.D.)."
