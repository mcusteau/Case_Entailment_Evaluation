The history of changes to section 8 since the inception of the
PMNOC Regulations
in 1993 should be reviewed. Those changes were commented upon in the
Regulatory Impact Analyses Statement
(RIAS) published together with the proposed amendments in the relevant Canada Gazette. The RIAS do not form part of the
Regulations
but have been used as an aid to interpreting the
Regulations
. I refer, for instance to the reasons of the Supreme Court of Canada, Binnie, J., for the majority, in
Biolyse
, supra, at paragraphs 45 to 49, as well as to the reasons of Bastarache, J., for the dissenting minority at paragraphs 155 to 159 in which the RIAS were accepted as an aid to interpretation of the
PMNOC Regulations
.
