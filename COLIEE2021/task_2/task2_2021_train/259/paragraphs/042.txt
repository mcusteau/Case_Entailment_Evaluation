Later in these reasons, Binnie, J., spoke of the "
deep freeze
" into which a generic's application for a NOC is placed simply by the institution of a court application by a first party. He echoed Iacobucci, J.'s, comment that such a process was "
draconian
". At paragraphs 23 and 24, Binnie, J., wrote:
"23. The innovator that filed the patent list may, within 45 days after being served with a Notice of Allegation, apply to the Federal Court for an order prohibiting the Minister from issuing a NOC until all of the listed patents have expired. Commencement of the application for prohibition automatically triggers a 24-month statutory freeze that stops the Minister from issuing a NOC unless within that period the prohibition application is finally disposed of by the court (see ss. 7(1)(e) and 7(4) of the
NOC Regulations
). In practice the prohibition proceedings can easily drag on beyond the initial 24-month period.
"24. It is important to note that under this procedure the court hearing the prohibition application has no discretion to lift the stay even if it thinks the innovator's case for interim relief is weak. Nor does the court have a discretion to leave the contending parties to their remedies under the
Patent Act
. The 'second person's' application for a NOC simply goes into deep-freeze until the statutory procedures have played themselves out. For these reasons, Iacobucci, J., described the regime as 'draconian' in
Merck Frosst Canada Inc. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare
), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 193, at para. 33."
