It is upon the first of these criteria, the "statutory grant" that Merck raises much of its argument. Merck points out that jurisdiction of the Federal Court is mentioned about twenty-six times in the
Patent
Act
. Many of these provisions conferring jurisdiction deal with appeals from federal tribunals and persons such as the Commissioner of Patents. A frequently used provision is section 54 which confers jurisdiction both on the Federal Court as well as the appropriate superior court of the relevant province in matters of patent infringement. Another frequently used provision is section 60 which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Federal Court to impeach a patent. Nowhere, says Merck, in the
Patent
Act
can one find a conferral of jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear and determine actions brought under the provisions of section 8 of the
PMNOC Regulations
.
