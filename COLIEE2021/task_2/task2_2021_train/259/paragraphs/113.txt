[113]
Subsection 8(1)(a) requires that the Court look at the date that the Minister says that the generic's application is approved subject to any outstanding
PMNOC Regulations
matters such as, in this case, application T-884-03. Here the date of such a letter is February 3, 2004. I can consider some other date where the evidence persuades me that I should. There is absolutely no evidence before me that the Minister would have sent the letter of February 3, 2004 at some earlier or later date having regard to some event or some conduct of some person or otherwise.
