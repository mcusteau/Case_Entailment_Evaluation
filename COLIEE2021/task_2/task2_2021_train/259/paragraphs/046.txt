Isaac, C.J., in dissent, presaged Binnie, J.'s, later comments in
Biolyse
in referring at paragraph 74 to the balancing of the rights of patentees and generics:
"74. In my respectful opinion, my colleague's decision ignores the dual purpose of the 1998 regulatory scheme which seeks to balance the right of patentees with the intent of facilitating the entry of generic products into the market. My colleague's decision also has the effect of extending the right of the appellant under the 969 patent."
