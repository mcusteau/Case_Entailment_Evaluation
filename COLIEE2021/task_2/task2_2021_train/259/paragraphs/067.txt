Thus, under section 20(2) of the
Federal Courts
Act
the Federal Court may accept jurisdiction in a patent matter as being made "
under authority
" of a federal statute. The
Patent
Act
, section 55.2(4) authorizes regulations to be made, such as the
PMNOC Regulations
, conferring jurisdiction on "
any
court of competent jurisdiction
" (emphasis added). Section 2 of
PMNOC Regulations
names Federal Court as such a court. Section 12(2) of the
Patent
Act
gives the
PMNOC Regulations
the same effect as a statute.
