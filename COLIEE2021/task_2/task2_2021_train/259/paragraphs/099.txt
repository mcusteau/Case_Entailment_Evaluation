At pages 165 to 168, Professor Sullivan discusses how a Court may "read down" or "read in" in respect of a statute. At page 165 she says:
"
Reading down vs. reading in.
The terms 'reading down' and 'reading in' are used in both statutory interpretation and
Charter
application. In statutory interpretation, they refer to interpretative techniques designed to give effect to the intended scope of legislation; in
Charter
application, they refer to remedies designed to adjust the intended scope because the legislation as enacted violates guaranteed rights or freedoms in a way that cannot be justified under s. 1. In both contexts, however, reading down refers to narrowing the scope of the legislative text, while reading in refers to expanding its scope.
"The point to be made here is that reading down and reading in both require the interpreter to add words to legislative text. The different lies in the effect of the additional words: reading down adds words of restriction or qualification, whereas reading in ads words that expand the reach of the legislation."
