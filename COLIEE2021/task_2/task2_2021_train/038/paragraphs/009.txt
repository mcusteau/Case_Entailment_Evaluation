  I would firstly point out that a moratorium on removals to Congo does not in and of itself prevent the H & C application from being denied. The H & C decision by the Officer and the enforcement of the removal order presently against the applicant are two distinct steps, as was stated in Argueles v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1477, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1777 at paragraph 23: 
 
 
 
 In the case at bar, it is worth noting here that the Act does not make the validity of the removal order subject to its enforcement or enforceability. The Act clearly separates the two proceedings (Kalombo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 615 (F.C.T.D.) (QL); Nguyen v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 F.C. 696 (C.A.), at pages 708-9). When the panel has made a removal order, the question of when and where the person concerned will be removed is entirely a matter for the Minister (Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84, at paragraph 74). At this stage, therefore, it cannot be assumed that the deportation order will be carried out by the Minister.
