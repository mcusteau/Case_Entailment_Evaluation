  The applicant is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of Congo ("Congo") and arrived in Canada on September 1, 2000. He applied for refugee status upon arrival, but his application was refused on August 22, 2002. A removal order was entered shortly thereafter but never enforced as a moratorium on removals to Congo was and remains in effect. In January 2003, the applicant applied for an exemption from the visa requirements on H & C grounds.
