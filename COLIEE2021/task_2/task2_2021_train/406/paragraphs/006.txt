On the facts of this matter, the visa officer appears to have concluded that the applicant did not successfully operate a business or "... an integral profit-generating part of the business, ..." despite the evidence before him from the executive director of the applicant's employer, because of the applicant's title as "assistant factory manager", the fact that he did not own shares in his employer, the level of his salary and his reporting relationship. Title is not a relevant consideration, except as it may accurately reflect responsibility. Ownership of shares in the business is not a relevant consideration in respect of operation of a business. Salary may be a relevant consideration, but there is nothing to indicate that the visa officer took into account the evidence before him that the applicant received performance bonuses in addition to his salary which might have been significant in amount and been in the nature of profit sharing that would involve the applicant in enjoyment of a share in his employers success. The applicant's reporting relationship is certainly relevant to "control" but, as with his title, is much less relevant to the question of operation of a business than the nature of the applicant's authority and responsibility.
