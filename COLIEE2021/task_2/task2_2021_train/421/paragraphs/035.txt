With respect to the incidents which took place on October 17, 18 and 19, 1985, the dates on which the defendant has stated "the plaintiff did not collect the garbage and refuse at [the station] at all", the plaintiff's evidence has, in several respects, contradicted that of the defendant. I do not propose to review the contradictions in detail here, having attempted to set out the evidence provided by the plaintiff and his wife and by Sergeant Stanley, the only three witnesses to testify with respect to these incidents, earlier in these reasons.
