In the result, therefore, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover that amount which corresponds to the profit he would have earned, over and above his expenses, had the contract not been terminated. The evidence here was to the effect that the plaintiff earned a "fluctuating profit" of between one quarter and one third of the whole contract price, and this evidence was left
uncontradicted
by the defendant. I resolve the lack of certainty as to the precise proposition of profit likely to have been earned by the plaintiff in the plaintiff's favour, by awarding to the plaintiff damages in the amount of $4,501.00, reflecting one third of the balance of the contract price ($ 13,505.00) outstanding at the date of termination.
