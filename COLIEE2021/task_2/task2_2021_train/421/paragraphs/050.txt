During argument counsel for the plaintiff summarized the plaintiff's claim as one for $13,700.00 in damages, being the original contract price of $19,400.00 less $5,700.00 which the plaintiff has already been paid by the defendant for services rendered to November 5, the date of termination. Acknowledging that "[counsel for the defendant would] no doubt argue with respect to damages that these damages should only reflect the profit which [the plaintiff] would have lost ...", counsel for the plaintiff nevertheless argued that the plaintiff should be awarded the full balance of the contract price, rather than solely the portion which he would have earned in profit. To compel the defendant to pay to the plaintiff only that portion of the contract price which he would have earned in profit, it was argued, would benefit the defendant unjustly, by relieving it of the obligation to pay the amount it would have, had the contract not been terminated. The latter argument is not persuasive for the defendant here obviously would have incurred costs to replace the services of Mr. Abenstein after the contract was terminated.
