According to the plaintiff, on the morning of October 19, 1985, he attended at the station with the decal removed from the windshield, whereupon Sergeant Stanley informed him that he was required to turn the decal in at the station. The plaintiff did not have the decal with him in the truck. He states that he made no attempt to bring the decal, which was in shreds and soaked with the fuel oil the plaintiff had used to remove it, from his home to the station on that day since he had "other things to do" and had already spent quite some time at the station. Sergeant Stanley was unable to recall, during the hearing of this matter, whether he ever requested that the plaintiff provide him with the pieces of the decal removed from the truck.
