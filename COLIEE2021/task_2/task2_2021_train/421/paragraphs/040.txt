Counsel for the plaintiff has conceded that there was no garbage pickup on the three days in question, but she has submitted:
"... the Abensteins ... have an explanation as to what happened and why they were prevented from picking up the garbage on the three days in question. Their evidence is such that it was because of the actions of base members that they were in fact prevented from attending and prevented from carrying out their obligations under the contract.
"The good faith of ... the plaintiff is indicated by the endeavour to contact Lieutenant Gregory and to try to get these matters straightened out. It was fully their intention to continue with the contract."
While counsel for the plaintiff has not specifically argued as much, it appears that the plaintiff's position is, in essence, that the defendant prevented the plaintiff's performance of his responsibilities under the contract, or "induced" the plaintiff's breach of the contract, through the imposition of requirements relating to the decal with which the plaintiff could not, on the three days in question, comply. The defendant, the plaintiff argues, prevented the plaintiff from entering the station to pick up the garbage, and now seeks to rely upon the plaintiff's failure to do so as justification for terminating the contract.
