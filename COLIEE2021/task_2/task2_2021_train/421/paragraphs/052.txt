The purpose of a damage award in a contract action is to place the innocent party in the position that party would have occupied had the contract been carried out by both parties. Generally, damages are compensatory in a claim for breach of contract and the innocent party is entitled to be compensated for any loss suffered. This purpose was described by the Privy Council in Wertheim v. Chicoutimi Pulp Co., [1911] A.C. 301, at p. 307, as follows:
"[I]t is the general intention of the law that, in giving damages for breach of contract, the party complaining should, so far as it can be done by money, be placed in the same position as he would have been in, if the contract had been performed ... That is a ruling principle."
Hence, in a contract case the plaintiff may be entitled to recover the potential profits he or she would have earned had the contract been carried out. That is what is left had the contract been performed, the price fully paid and the innocent party's costs incurred to perform the contract.
