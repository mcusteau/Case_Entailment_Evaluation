[26]
Counsel for the plaintiff relied upon this rule in two arguments. The first related to the issue of whether DSS 9076 should be considered as general conditions incorporated by reference in the contract. The second argument was that in the event DSS 9076 formed a part of the contract, clauses 15 and 16 of the General Conditions were so ambiguous that they ought not to be construed for the benefit of the defendant. Since, as I have indicated, I conclude that only clause 16(1) of the General Conditions DSS 9076 is relevant in this case, and since I do not find the terms of that clause ambiguous, I do not accept the second argument advanced by counsel.
