[51]
The defendant has argued that the plaintiff ought not to be allowed to benefit from the termination of this contract over and above the amount he would actually have received as profit under the contract. The defendant has referred to the contract itself, whereby a total weekly amount of $185.00 was to be paid to the plaintiff. The defendant submits that since the total weeks remaining in the contract between November 5, 1985, the termination date, and March 31, 1987, the date upon which the contract was to end, were seventy three weeks, the balance of the contract would have been worth $13,505.00. The evidence indicates that the plaintiff had a fluctuating profit of between one quarter and one third of the full contract price. One third of the balance of the contract price ($ 13,505.00) is $4,501.00. One quarter of the balance would be $3,376.00.
