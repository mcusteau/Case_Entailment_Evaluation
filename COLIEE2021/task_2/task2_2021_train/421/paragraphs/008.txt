It is at this stage that the accounts given of this incident by the plaintiff and Corporal Durand differ. According to the plaintiff, the Corporal walked around the truck and noticed a damaged firearm, which had been in the truck for "a year, year and a half", lying on the seat. The plaintiff maintains that the firearm was damaged inasmuch as it had a brass stuck in the barrel, and could not be loaded. The plaintiff further maintains that the presence of the firearm in the truck had been noted by several station personnel on previous occasions, including Sergeant Stanley, the station security officer. The plaintiff states that Corporal Durand took the gun, which was in three pieces, and "snapped it together hard". He then voiced his suspicion that the plaintiff did not have a certificate for the gun, and that, at any rate, he was prohibited from bringing a firearm onto the station without approval. The plaintiff states that he produced a Firearms Acquisition Certificate (FAC) for Corporal Durand's inspection, but that the Corporal pushed the certificate away, causing the plaintiff to lose his grip on it and drop it. There then occurred an exchange of rough language between the plaintiff and Corporal Durand, after which the plaintiff left the station with the firearm.
