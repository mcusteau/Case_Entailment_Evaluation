The contra proferentem rule has recently been considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of Hillis Oil and Sales Limited v. Wynn's Canada Ltd., [1986] 1 S.C.R. 57; 65 N.R. 23. In that case the issue was whether, in view of the inclusion of a notice requirement in one clause of a contract relating to termination, a second clause, also relating to termination, should be construed as impliedly requiring reasonable notice of termination. Mr. Justice Le Dain, for the Court, in establishing that this ambiguity with respect to the notice requirement should be resolved in favour of the appellant, stated, at p. 68:
"Given this ambiguity as to whether the distributor's agreements could be terminated pursuant to clause 23 with immediate effect or whether such termination could take effect only upon reasonable notice, I also agree with [the trial judge] that it should be resolved against Wynn's and in favour of Hillis by application of the contra proferentem rule of construction ...
"The rule is ... one of general application whenever, as in the case at bar, there is ambiguity in the meaning of a contract which one of the parties as the author of the document offers to the other, with no opportunity to modify its wording."
Mr. Justice Le Dain went on to point out that "the rule is stated in its general terms in Anson's Law of Contract (25th Ed. 1979), at p. 151, as follows:
"The words of written documents are construed more forcibly against the party using them. The rule is based on the principle that a man is responsible for ambiguities in his own expression, and has no right to induce another to contract with him on the supposition that his words mean one thing, while he hopes the Court will adopt a construction by which they would mean another thing, more to his advantage."
