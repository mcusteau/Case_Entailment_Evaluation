In light of the testimony of the plaintiff, his wife, and Sergeant Stanley, and in light of my earlier assessment of the credibility of that testimony, I am prepared to find that the plaintiff was, in fact, prevented from fulfilling the terms of his contract on the three days in question by the defendant, and specifically by Sergeant Stanley. While Sergeant Stanley, in his capacity as station security officer, was entitled to insist upon the plaintiff's compliance with a particular mode of admission to the station, the plaintiff's description of the requirements suddenly imposed, and the manner in which they were imposed, is suggestive of a certain pettiness. While the station security officer may impose upon whomever he sees fit a requirement that the person concerned seek access to the station by a particular means, or may refuse that person admission to the station where he sees fit, the defendant may not, in such a situation, then rely upon the plaintiff's failure to perform certain functions within the station as justification for terminating his contract.
