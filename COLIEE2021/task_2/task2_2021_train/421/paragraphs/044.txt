There was some implied reference in questions in cross-examination to relations between the plaintiff and staff members of the station and to communications between them. So far as he was questioned about this the plaintiff denied or explained his communications with others. There was also testimony in direct and cross-examination of Mr. and Mrs. Abenstein about letters written on their behalf by a lawyer, acting on instructions from Mrs. Abenstein during the summer of 1985. This sought confirmation that the contract would be fulfilled by the defendant and it was prompted by concern on the part of the Abensteins arising from reports that the station would soon be closed. While under the contract the plaintiff was to communicate with Lieutenant Gregory about the contract, he had every right to retain counsel to make enquiries on his behalf or to represent his interests. In a letter of October 29, 1985 from Lieutenant Gregory, upon which Mr. Grouette of the Department of Supply and Services relied in his decision to terminate the contract some reference is made to Mr. Abenstein's communications with staff and to his behaviour, but though the letter was submitted as an exhibit no evidence was adduced about the matters referred to by Gregory in the letter.
