Following this the plaintiff attended at the station with bits and pieces of the decal which had been removed, and turned these over to the person on duty at the gate. According to the plaintiff this person was Sergeant Stanley, but Sergeant Stanley himself had no recollection of receiving the pieces of the decal. The Abensteins testified that after receiving the pieces of the decal in a bag with the oil soaked cloth used to remove it, it had then been deposited in the back of the truck as garbage. Then a daily pass was issued to the plaintiff, who entered the base and picked up the garbage. From that date, the plaintiff continued picking up the garbage from the station for a period of approximately two weeks, incident free. During that two weeks he has testified that he was called to a meeting with Sergeant Stanley and Lieutenant Gregory, but I have been provided with little information about what transpired at the meeting.
