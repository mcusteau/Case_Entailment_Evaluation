Sergeant Stanley gave the Court evidence with respect to this incident, stating only that following his conversation with the plaintiff with respect to the necessity for removing the decal, there were three days when the plaintiff did not attend at the station to pick up garbage and in addition, there were "more than three definite occasions" on which the plaintiff came to the gate of the station but turned his truck around at the gate without ever entering the station. Sergeant Stanley explained that the barrier was not lifted for the plaintiff on these occasions because the plaintiff never exited his truck and approached the guard house to fill out and sign a daily pass, as was required.
