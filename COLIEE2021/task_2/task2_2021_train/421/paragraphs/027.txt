[27]
In considering whether these General Conditions form part of the contract in this case I note again that one term of the contract document does make specific reference to DSS 9076 and it provides:
"G5 General Conditions DSS 9076 (Services) shall form part of this Contract. Paragraphs 3 and 4 on the reverse side hereof do not apply to this Contract."
It is argued that the second sentence in this term of the contract, by drawing attention to "Conditions" printed in small type on the reverse side of the second page of the contract, suggested the interpretation that the conditions on the reverse side of the page, obviously preprinted and in a smaller type, were what was meant by the first sentence referring to "General Conditions DSS 9076". Mrs. Abenstein testified that this was her understanding of that clause in the contract. As the evidence before me makes clear, DSS 9076 was a separate document which I find on the testimony of the plaintiff and his wife, and in the absence of any contrary evidence, had never been provided to the plaintiff. Mrs. Abenstein's role in what had evolved as a family business, was to read all documents and explain them to her husband, to complete the tender forms on his advice, to maintain such rudimentary records as were required, to complete invoices submitted monthly, to arrange for income tax returns to be completed, and to discuss with lawyers and others any matters requiring discussion about the business. In all of this she acted on behalf of her husband, a status confirmed in his testimony.
