Sergeant Stanley's description of this encounter with the plaintiff is somewhat different than the account given by the plaintiff. According to Sergeant Stanley, once he informed the plaintiff that he could no longer use the decal and would require a daily pass, the plaintiff reached up and tore off a piece of the decal, handing it to the Sergeant. He then, according to Sergeant Stanley, turned his truck around and left the station. The Sergeant described the daily pass system for admission to the base as the process regularly followed at national defence bases for those who were not station personnel and the pass included a provision authorizing search of a vehicle admitted by means of the pass and required signature of the person admitted.
