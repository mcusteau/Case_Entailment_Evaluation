I have finally to consider the defendant's allegation, as set out in the particulars, that the plaintiff "failed to comply with certain rules specified by the Station Construction Engineering Officer regarding the plaintiff's approach to the station and communications with staff at the station". The rules in question were not identified by counsel for the defendant during argument, nor was this point vigorously argued. Even assuming that the "rules" in question were the station standing orders described by Corporal Durand in his testimony, the specific rules relating to the plaintiff's "approach to the station and communications with staff at the station" were not identified with any precision in the evidence.
