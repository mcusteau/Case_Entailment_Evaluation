I think it is correct interpretation of paragraph 6(1)(a) in light of recent decisions in the Supreme Court of Canada, in Stubart, supra, etc., and Lor-Wes Contracting Ltd. v. Her Majesty the Queen, [1985] 2 C.T.C. 79; 60 N.R. 321 (F.C.A.) where Mr. Justice MacGuigan wrote at p. 83 C.T.C.:
"[...] The only principle of interpretation now recognized is a words-in-total-context approach with a view to determining the object and spirit of the taxing provisions."
