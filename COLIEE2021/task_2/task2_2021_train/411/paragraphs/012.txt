Crown counsel argued that the payment of this so-called "allowance" to the taxpayer should be treated as a benefit accruing to the latter by virtue of his office or employment regardless of whether or not the amount was sufficient to adequately compensate the plaintiff for the real loss incurred upon his transfer to Ottawa. Finally he pointed out that the amount received by the plaintiff did not qualify as one of the exceptions which are provided in paragraph 6(1)(b) of the Act:
"
PERSONAL OR LIVING EXPENSES

(ii) travelling and separation allowances received under service regulations as a member of the Canadian Forces,

(v) reasonable allowances for travelling expenses received by an employee from his employer in respect of a period when he was employed in connection with the selling of property or negotiating of contracts for his employer,

(B) the metropolitan area, if there is one, where that establishment was located,
