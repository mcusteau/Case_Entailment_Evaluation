Counsel for the plaintiff disputed the allegation that the amount paid to the plaintiff was an "allowance" within the meaning of the Act. He conceded that there was no obligation placed upon the recipients of the so-called "allowance" to actually purchase another home in order to qualify, but he had in fact purchased a residence and he maintained that the amount in question could not be considered an allowance as the taxpayer had, as anticipated, increased mortgage costs.
