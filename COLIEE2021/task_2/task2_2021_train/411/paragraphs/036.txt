The Supreme Court of Canada in Savage (supra) accepted this test but not without reservation. It disagreed with the statement that, to be received in the capacity of employee, the payment had to be characterized as remuneration for services; it cited the passage from R. v. Poynton, [1972] 3 O.R. 727; 72 D.T.C. 6329 (C.A.), which appears to be authority for the proposition of "conferring an economic benefit". Evans, J.A., speaking for the Court, said at pp. 6335-6:
"I am of the opinion that there is no difference between money and money's worth in calculating income. They are both benefits and fall within the language of s. 3 and 5 [now 6] of the Act, being benefits received or enjoyed by the respondent in respect of, in the course of, or by virtue of his office or employment. I do not believe the language to be restricted to benefits that are related to the office or employment in the sense that they represent a form of remuneration for services rendered. If it is
a material acquisition which confers an economic benefit on the taxpayer
and does not constitute an exemption, e.g. loan or gift, then it is within the all-embracing definition of s. 3 [i.e. the definition of 'income']" [Square brackets and underlining are mine]
