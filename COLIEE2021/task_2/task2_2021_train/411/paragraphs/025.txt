The Ransom case, supra, also emphasized a similar connection between the rendering of service and the payment of the amount before the compensation was to be considered income from an office or employment. At the time of the Ransom decision, the present subsection 5(1) was combined with paragraphs 6(1)(a) and (b). NoÃ«l J., referring to the old section 5 as a whole, wrote at p. 5242:
"In order, however, to properly evaluate its intent it is, I believe, necessary to bear in mind firstly, that section 5 of the Act is concerned solely with the taxation of income identified by its relationship to a certain entity, namely, an office or employment and in order to be taxable as income from an office or employment, money received by an employee must not merely constitute income as distinct from capital, but it must arise from his office or employment ... Secondly, the question whether a payment arises from an office or employment depends on its causative relationship to an office or employment, in other words, whether the services in the employment are the effective cause of the payment."
