I am of the view that paragraph 6(1)(a) is in the Act to provide a method to tax all those individuals who receive perks in addition to their salaries. Employers may offer a wide variety of inducements ranging from pensions and death benefits to liberal expense accounts and allowances to more immediate advantages, such as country club facilities and the use of company cars, boats and other property. It is only fair that these items be added to income and taxed. Those with greater economic advantages should pay their fair share. A disparity in the tax treatment of an employee who receives all his compensation as salary and wages and one who receives the same amount of compesnation but partly in the form of fringe benefits and allowances is not defensible.
