In 1973 the plaintiff purchased a home in the municipality of Pierrefonds, Quebec, for approximately $16,500, assuming a $13,000 mortgage with interest at 9 1/4% per annum with monthly payments of less than $150. It was ideally located for easy commuting to work. Unable to sell his home prior to leaving Dorval, it was assigned an appraised value of $28,000 as at December 31, 1976. It was finally sold for $24,000 in April 1977. Since the plaintiff had contracted not to take up residence in the Province of Quebec upon transferring to his new post in Ottawa, he could not avail himself of the lower housing market in Hull, Quebec. He was unable to find similarly-priced accommodations within the city limits of Ottawa itself and was constrained to looking to the outskirts of the capital to purchase a home he could reasonably afford. He settled in the township of West Carleton, Ontario, a rural community some 40 miles from Ottawa. He purchased a house for $82,000 which was encumbered by a $60,000 mortgage bearing interest at the rate of 11 1/2% per annum and monthly payments of $599. He received an Accommodation Differential payment totalling $15,571 to compensate over a five-year period for the interest payable on the amount of his increased mortgage as well as the increased rate of interest. In addition, he was awarded a further sum of $2,155.41 under the terms of the Social Disruption Allowance.
