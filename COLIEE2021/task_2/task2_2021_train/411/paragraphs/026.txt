The payment with which I am concerned did not form any part of, or adjustment to, the plaintiff's normal salary. He received his full annual wages; the amount in question was in addition to normal compensation and in no way related to services performed by the taxpayer. The amount paid to the plaintiff was intended to defray the additional cost of a greater mortgage he would have to assume upon relocating.
