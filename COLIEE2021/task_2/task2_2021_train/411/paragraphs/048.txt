In my opinion, that reasoning is neither here nor there. Firstly, the decision of the Tax Court is not based on the facts of the case which are that the plaintiff taxpayer did purchase a home. Secondly, the taxpayer was forced to accept the transfer in order to retain his employment. Under those circumstances, I would think it was not only his choice but his right to purchase a home in the Ottawa area and attempt to put himself in the same position he was in prior to being moved from his home in Montreal. From the evidence adduced, it is manifestly clear that the plaintiff "put nothing in his pocket but merely saved the pocket".
