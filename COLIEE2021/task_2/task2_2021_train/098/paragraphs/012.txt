  In my view, FH's position is speculative. Under the  
 CBCA 
 , the Director may order a company to change its corporate name if that name is prohibited. Under the  
 Canada Business Corporations Regulations 2001 
 , SOR/2001-512, s. 25, a corporate name is prohibited if it is confusing, having regard to all of the circumstances, including the distinctiveness of a trademark, the length of time it has been used, the nature of the business associated with the mark, the resemblance between the corporate name and the trademark, and the territorial area in which the corporate name and trademark are used.
