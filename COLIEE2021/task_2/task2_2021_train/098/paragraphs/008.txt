  In November 2005, FH asked the Director to stay the  
 CBCA 
  proceedings. It suggested that a stay was appropriate given that it was the registered owner of the trademark "Fairmont" - the alleged source of confusion - and its entitlement to that mark was under challenge in the trademark proceedings. In addition, it submitted that the parallel processes could result in conflicting decisions or absurd consequences, from which FH would suffer irreparable harm. In March 2006, FH's request for a stay was denied and it now seeks judicial review.
