  FRP has begun three different trademark proceedings against FH. In 2000 and 2001, FRP challenged two of the marks FH had acquired from FHSR (before the Trademarks Opposition Board). In June 2005, it commenced a challenge to FH's word and design marks for "Fairmont" in the Federal Court (under s. 57 of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. T-13). All of these proceedings are currently ongoing.
