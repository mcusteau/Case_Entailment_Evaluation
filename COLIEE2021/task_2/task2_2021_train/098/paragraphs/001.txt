 O'Reilly, J. 
 : The respondent Fairmont Resort Properties Inc. (FRP) brought an application under s. 12 of the  
 Canadian Business Corporations Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (relevant enactments are set out in an Annex) requesting the Director of Corporations Canada to order the applicants, Fairmont Hotels Inc. and Fairmont Hotels and Resorts Inc. (collectively, FH) to change their corporate names because of the risk of confusion. Given that there are ongoing trademark disputes between the parties, both in Federal Court and before the Trademarks Opposition Board, FH asked the Director to stay FRP's application pending the outcome of those other proceedings. The Director refused.
