[14]
I am in agreement with the applicant's submission that the Supreme Court has recognized in
Singh v. M.E.I.
, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177; 58 N.R. 1; 17 D.L.R.(4th) 422; 14 C.R.R. 13; 12 Admin. L.R. 137, that s. 7 is engaged where a person claims Canada's protection as a Convention refugee. I am also in agreement with the submission that where a person faces removal to a country where there might be a threat to the security of that person s. 7 is engaged such that the principles of fundamental justice must be adhered to. However, I do not agree that the protection of s. 7 afforded to the applicant because she is the subject of a removal order is extended to the protection of the "family interests" or the "family unit", including protection of her child. Her child benefits in his own right from the protection of the
Charter
as a Canadian citizen. He is not subject to a removal order and is not a party to this application. The issue of whether or not his
Charter
rights have been infringed is not an issue before me.
