However, the respondent cites three cases in support of the submission that there is no right to an interview or a hearing. In
Ha v. M.E.I.
(1992), 56 F.T.R. 74; 8 Admin. L.R.(2d) 59 (T.D.), Rouleau, J., found that in the context of the humanitarian and compassionate review stage of the Backlog Clearance Program that
"The determination of whether or not humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist is discretionary and can be made without personal appearance of the person involved. It is a decision that involves no complex legal issues."
In
Kaur v. M.E.I.
(1987), 5 Imm. L.R.(2d) 148 (T.D.), Cullen, J., found that there was no obligation to grant an interview. In
Koutsouveli v. M.E.I.
(1988), 21 F.T.R. 271; 6 Imm. L.R.(2d) 152, I held that while immigration officers are under an obligation to adhere to the rules of procedural fairness, this does not necessarily include the right to an oral hearing. The situation in that case was very similar to this one and I found that provided the applicant was given ample opportunity to set out the humanitarian grounds for her request, there was no necessity for an interview. In that case, as in this case, the applicant's counsel was given the opportunity to make written submissions and it appears in this case that the immigration officer considered these submissions in her notes.
