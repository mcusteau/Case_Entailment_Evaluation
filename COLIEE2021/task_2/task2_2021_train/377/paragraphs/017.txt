Regarding the alleged infringement of s. 12, in
Said v. M.E.I.
(1992), 55 F.T.R. 81; 91 D.L.R.(4th) 400, this court found that provided the rules of procedural fairness and natural justice have been adhered to, the deportation of a refugee claimant to their country of origin when they have been determined not to be a refugee cannot be cruel or unusual punishment within s. 12 of the
Charter
. In this instance there is no evidence of unfairness or unreasonableness on the part of the immigration officer.
