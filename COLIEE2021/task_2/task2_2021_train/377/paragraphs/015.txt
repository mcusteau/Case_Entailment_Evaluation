Regarding the second question about whether the applicant's rights under ss. 7 and 12 have been infringed, the applicant submits that the decision regarding her application for humanitarian and compassionate consideration violated the principles of fundamental justice on the basis of the above arguments regarding an unreasonable/fettered decision and the duty of fairness. Further, a breach of fundamental justice occurred through the failure of the immigration officer to obtain assurances that the applicant would not be removed to the United States to Sri Lanka. The applicant submits that the immigration officer erred in taking into consideration that the applicant would be able to make a refugee claim in the United States, that this is an irrelevant consideration. The immigration officer also erred by not giving the applicant the opportunity to respond to this consideration. Finally, the decision to remove her constitutes cruel and unusual treatment of both her and her child pursuant to s. 12.
