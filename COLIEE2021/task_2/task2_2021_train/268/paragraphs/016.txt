Novopharm's evidence on the motion before Prothonotary Milczynski was provided by Mr. David Windross, an employee of Novopharm (VP, Government, Professional & Regulatory Affairs). He provided the following important information:
(a) The contents of Novopharm's ANDS are strictly confidential;
(b) Novopharm would not want this information disclosed;
(c) Novopharm always treats this material as confidential;
(d) Mr. Windross understands that Health Canada will not release the contents of an ANDS until after the product has gone to market;
(e) Until the product goes to market, Health Canada maintains the confidentiality of the entire contents of an ANDS;
(f) If a third party obtained anything in an ANDS, Novopharm's business interests could be severely and negatively affected;
(g) It is vital to keep all information in an ANDS confidential to prevent other pharmaceutical companies from using that information for their own purposes, for example, using Novopharm's formulation to produce their own version of the drug;
(h) While some of the contents of Novopharm's ANDS may be in the public domain, the manner in which this has been communicated, the precise content of each communication and the timing of those communications would be of great interest to Novopharm's competitors to gain a better understanding of Novopharm's approach to obtaining approval. This better understanding could help them prepare and seek approval for their own submissions;
(i) While documents such as the product monograph and product labelling are similar to the PREVACID equivalents [which are in the public domain], the differences are not public and those differences could help a competitor develop its own equivalent drug;
(j) While literature contained in an ANDS is not confidential, the list of references could reveal Novopharm's strategy for gaining approval for its product that would be recognized by Novopharm's competitors as having value.
