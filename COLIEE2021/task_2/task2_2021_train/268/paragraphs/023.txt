Dr. Liston provided the Court with three essential responses to Mr. Windross' arguments concerning Context Information:
(a) In the ordinary case there is nothing confidential about any Context Information in the specific documents that are in issue in this case;
(b) While there may be an extraordinary case where the Context Information from the specific documents in this case could be confidential, there is no evidence that this is such an extraordinary case; and
(c) Even if there were discernable Context Information from the specific documents in this case, it is not the kind of information that would give competitors any "edge" or advantage relative to Novopharm or that would cause harm if disclosed.
