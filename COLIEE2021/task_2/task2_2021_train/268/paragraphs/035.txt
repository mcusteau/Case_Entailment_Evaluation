Novopharm points out that the relationship between s. 6(7) and 6(8) of the
Regulations
, and the requirement that anything disclosed under s. 6(7) be treated confidentially, were imposed deliberately by the legislature. These subsections were added to the
Regulations
by amendment in 1998. The Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement for the amendment explains that the addition of s. 6(7) was made to improve the
Regulations
by explicitly providing for disclosure from a generic manufacturer's drug submission. The quid pro quo for this extraordinary disclosure by a generic manufacturer to its brand-name opponent was that the materials should be treated confidentially.
