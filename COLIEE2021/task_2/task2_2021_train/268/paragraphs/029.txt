The parties agree that the questions raised are not vital to the final issue, but Novopharm submits that the Orders are clearly wrong, since the exercise of discretion by Prothonotary Milczynski was based upon:
(a) A wrong principle, in that she acted contrary to s. 6(8) of the
Regulations
, which requires that a document produced under s. 6(7) of the
Regulations
be treated confidentially;
(b) A wrong principle and a misapprehension of the facts, in that she relied upon the unqualified and, therefore, inadmissible expert opinion evidence of Dr. Liston, which she preferred over the evidence of Mr. Windross; and
(c) A misapprehension of the facts, in that she found that Novopharm failed to meet the onus upon it of showing that the documents in issue are confidential and that harm to Novopharm could result from their public disclosure, despite the evidence of Mr. Windross and the lack of admissible evidence from Dr. Liston.
