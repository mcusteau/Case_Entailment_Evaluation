Dr. Liston's point was that there could be situations where the "Context Information" contained in specific documents might be confidential, but there was nothing to suggest that such was the case in this instance. My reading of Mr. Windross' evidence, is that, apart from his general assertions about the confidentiality of the whole package of documents disclosed, he did not identify specific "Context Information" that was, in fact, confidential and relate this to a specific harm that disclosure would cause.
