Novopharm's position is that material to be filed in a Federal Court proceeding is required by law to be treated confidentially (as in the case of materials ordered to be produced pursuant to s. 6(7) of the
Regulations
) and that the provisions of Rule 152 of the
Federal Court Rules
apply, unless otherwise ordered by the Court. Like s. 6(8) of the
Regulations
, the language of Rule 152 is mandatory, unless the Court specifically orders otherwise. Novopharm points out that Prothonotary Milczynski does not refer to, or consider the effect of Rule 152, anywhere in the Orders.
