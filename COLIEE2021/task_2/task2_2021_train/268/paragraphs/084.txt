With respect to Novopharm's product monograph and its description of the non-medicinal ingredients in Novopharm's formulation, Mr. Windross stated as follows:
"15. It is true that Novopharm's proposed Product Monograph for its lansoprazole delayed-release capsules is similar to the PREVACID Product Monograph in many respects. It is, however, the differences between Novopharm's proposed Product Monograph and the PREVACID Product Monograph that are relevant to the issues in this case. Those differences are not public. They have been kept strictly confidential by Novopharm and will remain confidential until Novopharm's product goes to market. This is, in part, because the differences could help a competitor understand and copy Novopharm's strategy for gaining approval for its lansoprazole product before the expiry of the patents at issue in this case.
"16. If Novopharm's proposed Product Monograph were made public, Novopharm's competitors would not only have all the details of Novopharm's product, including its formulation and bioequivalence information, but would also be able to base their own proposed Product Monographs on Novopharm's. While this is a fact of life for both brand-name and generic companies once their product goes to market (as the Product Monograph is released to the public at that time), it would be very prejudicial to Novopharm for it to be publicly available before that time."
