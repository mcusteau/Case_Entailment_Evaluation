Novopharm further argues that Prothonotary Milczynski made her decision based upon a wrong principle because Rule 151 includes only one mandatory requirement for the issuance of a protective order: the Court must be satisfied that the material "should be treated as confidential." In Rule 152, the legislature set out specific restrictions on material to be filed that "is required by law to be treated confidentially." These conditions, says Novopharm, are satisfied by the mandatory language of s. 6(8) of the Regulation, which requires that materials produced under s. 6(7) be treated confidentially.
