Prothonotary Milczynski was obviously aware of the import of s. 6(8) of the
Regulations
because she refers to it and discusses it before applying the
Sierra Club
test under Rule 151:
"Section 6(8) of the
Regulations
further provides that any documents produced pursuant to s. 6(7), 'shall be treated confidentially', meaning that as between the parties, the documents and information from the ANDS that have been ordered to be produced for the purposes of the litigation shall not be, and shall not be caused to be, disclosed."
