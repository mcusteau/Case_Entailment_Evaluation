Russell, J., observed in
A.C. and B.D. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1861; 243 F.T.R. 211 (F.C.), at paras. 18 - 19, that there is a "heavy onus" to obtain a Confidentiality Order. The case must be "clearly established" and more than merely "speculative." The applicant must establish a "real and substantial" risk of harm that is "well-grounded in the evidence" and it is insufficient for the witnesses to rely on "
bare statements assertions
" (sic), as Novopharm did before Prothonotary Milczynski.
