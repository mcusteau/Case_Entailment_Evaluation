Abbott points out that, in the present case, Prothonotary Milczynski explicitly applied the
Sierra Club
test and found that Novopharm did not satisfy the heavy onus because Novopharm failed to:
(a) Identify the information for which protection was sought;
(b) Demonstrate a legally relevant interest specific to Novopharm in the alleged confidentiality of that information;
(c) Demonstrate a public interest related to Novopharm's alleged specific interest that would justify the blanket protective order it sought; or
(d) Prove any specific harm to any legally relevant interest if information were not excluded from the public record of the proceedings of the Court.
