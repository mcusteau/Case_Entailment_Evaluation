Other than the discrete exception referred to in its own appeal, Abbott says that Prothonotary Milczynski exercised her discretion in a way that was entirely consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada's test in
Sierra Club of Canada v. Canada (Minister of Finance) et al.
, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522; 287 N.R. 203; 2002 SCC 41, on when protective orders should be issued and how the underlying information should be assessed. Her findings of fact flow clearly from the evidence. There is no misapprehension of the facts identified in Novopharm's materials on this appeal; only a dissatisfaction with Prothonotary Milczynski's findings. As a result, Abbott submits that Novopharm's motion to appeal should be dismissed.
