  Moreover, the Court refers to the observations of Justice Zinn in  
 Singh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 ), 2009 FC 620 at para 7, [2009] FCJ No 797: 
 
 
 
 [7] I find that there is no merit to the submission that the officer ought to have provided the applicant with an opportunity to address his concerns. Justice Russell in  
 Ling v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FC 1198, reviewed the law as to when a visa officer ought to provide such an opportunity. Relying on  
 Ali v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1998] F.C.J. No. 468, he noted firstly that there was no statutory right to an interview, or any dialogue of the sort suggested here.  
 Secondly, it was noted that generally an opportunity to respond is available only when the officer has information of which the applicant is not aware. As in  
 Ling 
 , that is not the situation here and thus no opportunity was required to be given to Mr. Singh to address the officer's concerns. Further, when as here the officer is relying only on materials submitted by or known to the applicant, there is no need for an interview 
 . [Emphasis added.]
