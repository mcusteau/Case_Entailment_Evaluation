  The Officer also gave little weight to a letter submitted by the applicant from Indepco Ltd. to corroborate his experience under the NOC code 0111 as a Financial Control Manager, also finding that it was likely fabricated for immigration purposes (Tribunal Record, pp 8 and 73). The Officer noted that the letter was printed on the same type of paper, using the same low-quality ink-jet printer, and otherwise looked very similar to the Cirico reference letter. The Officer noted that the duties listed on this letter also appear to be copied from the wording of the NOC code 0111.
