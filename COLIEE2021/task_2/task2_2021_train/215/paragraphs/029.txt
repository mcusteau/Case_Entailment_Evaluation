  In addition, I am of the opinion that counsel for the plaintiffs had plenty of previous opportunities for raising the issue of the validity of the designations and that this motion is by no means "timely". The failure of the plaintiffs to raise the issue beforehand has caused the Minister to take a course of action which is impossible to alter. Specifically, since the reply to the opinion letter was provided and the 1985 return filed, the Minister has acted on the basis that the validity of the designations and these actions cannot be changed retroactively.
