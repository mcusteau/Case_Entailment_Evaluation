  The main action involves an appeal by the plaintiffs of notices of assessment for the 1984 and 1985 taxation years. The principal issue in the original statement of claim was whether the plaintiffs are entitled to a Part VIII refund on the basis that a number of expenditures constituted scientific research and experimental development expenditures within the meaning of s. 37(1) and s. 194(2) of the  
 Income Tax Act 
  ( 
 Act 
 ). The decision of the Associate Senior Prothonotary granted leave to the plaintiffs to amend the original statement of claim to raise the issue of the validity of a number of designations made by the plaintiffs during the 1985 taxation year pursuant to s. 194(4) of the  
 Act 
 . The Minister's principal objections to these amendments are that they effectively withdraw admissions made in the original statement of claim and reply, that they raise a completely new cause of action and that they will prejudice the defendant in a manner not compensable in costs.
