  On the issue of whether the amendments constitute a withdrawal of an admission, it is the plaintiffs' opinion that paragraph 7 of the statement of claim and paragraphs 6 and 7 of the reply do not constitute admissions as to the validity of the designations. In their view, paragraph 6 is an express denial of the validity of all of the allegations in paragraph 12(d) of the defense, including the remarks about the designations. However, if the amendments are considered to be a withdrawal of an admission, the plaintiffs submit that the same principles of law as those governing any other amendment apply. In particular and in addition to the above arguments regarding the amendments generally, they maintain that the alleged admission was made inadvertently and that they acted promptly to remedy the error.
