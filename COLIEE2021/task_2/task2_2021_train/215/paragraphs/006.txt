  Part VIII of the  
 Income Tax Act 
  provides the structure for a deduction from business income for scientific research and experimental development expenditures when third parties have invested in the corporation and are going to claim the scientific research and experimental development credit in s. 127.3. When a corporation has designated the investors and amounts received under s. 194(4), the corporation incurs tax liability pursuant to s. 194(1) for 50% of the total amount designated. Section 194(4.2) was enacted to limit the application of s. 194(4) to designations made prior to 10 October 1984. However, s. 194(4.2)(b) allows certain designations made after 10 October 1984 to be "grandfathered" into the application of Part VIII if they meet specific criteria. Section 194(2) permits a reduction of the corporation's tax liability incurred by the designations in the amount of 50% of the total scientific research and experimental development expenditures of the corporation in the taxation year which meet the criteria in ss. 37(1)(a) and 37(1)(b). That portion of the latter amount which exceeds the tax liability incurred by the designations is refundable pursuant to section 194(3).
