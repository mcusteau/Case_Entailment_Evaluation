  By notice of assessment dated 8 June 1987, the Minister disallowed $26,579,013 of the expenditures, including the Proteus expenditure. Taking into consideration the $8,700,000 payment and the error in reporting the liability for the designated amounts, the assessment resulted in a total Part VIII tax liability on the part of Scannar for the 1985 taxation year in the amount of $4,405,316.50. On 1 September 1987 Scannar filed a notice of objection. The assessment was confirmed by the Minister on 14 December 1988.
