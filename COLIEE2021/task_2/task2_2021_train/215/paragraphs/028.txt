  These amendments would cause prejudice to the defendant because the Minister is now precluded from reassessing the third party investors. The potential prejudice caused, in the amount of $14,500,000 representing the total amount of credits claimed and allowed on the basis of the designations and not including interest, is clearly not compensable by costs. While it could be argued that this prejudice is dependent upon the final resolution of the case and is not relevant to the determination here, I am persuaded that when you weigh the potential prejudice along with some of the other factors to be considered against the scarcity of the evidence presented with respect to the merits of the issue to be raised, the proposed amendments do not aid in "determining the real questions in controversy between the parties" nor do they raise a "triable issue".
