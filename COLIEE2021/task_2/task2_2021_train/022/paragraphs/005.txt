  By virtue of s. 225.2, the Minister may give a notice or direction to pay forthwith an amount assessed for tax where it may reasonably be considered by the Minister that the collection of the amount so assessed would be jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof. In that event, the Minister may forthwith take any of the collection actions described in paragraphs (a) to (g) inclusive of s. 225.1(1) of the Act. The burden of justifying any direction so made rests squarely on the Minister by virtue of s. 225.2(5).
