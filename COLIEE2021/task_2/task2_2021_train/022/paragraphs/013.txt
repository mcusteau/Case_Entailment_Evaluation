  Apart from the ground of mere inability to pay, the only scintilla of evidence tending to support the direction to pay is contained in the concluding paragraphs of the affidavit of Patricia Colleen Connor, namely, paragraphs 42 and 43 thereof, which read respectively as follows: 
 
 
 
 "42. I do verily believe that Bonnie Ellen Danielson is financially dependent on Charles Edward Danielson and because of that fact and the other facts alleged herein, the payment of the amount assessed in respect of Bonnie Ellen Danielson would be jeopardized by a delay in the collection thereof. 
 
 
 
 "43. I do further verily believe that because of the facts alleged herein the Minister of National Revenue is justified in directing both Charles Edward Danielson and Bonnie Ellen Danielson to pay the assessed amount forthwith."
