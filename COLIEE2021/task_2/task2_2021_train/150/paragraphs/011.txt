 [11] 
  From the pleadings and the material before the Court on this motion, there appears to be three central issues to this litigation: 
 
 
 
 1) Are any of the concerts before December 16, 2002 barred by any limitation period? 
 
 
 
 2) Can SOCAN show the requisite elements for copyright infringement including but not limited to ownership, performance of the works at issue, absence of consent of the owner and applicability of the tariffs to the concert? 
 
 
 
 3) Has MLSE authorized or allowed infringing performances in such manner as to render it liable for royalties?
