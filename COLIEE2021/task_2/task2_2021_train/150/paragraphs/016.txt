  In  
 Granville Shipping Co. v. Pegasus Lines Ltd. (T.D.) 
 , [1996] 2 F.C. 853, this Court outlined the general principles applicable to summary judgments. 
 
 
 
 8 
  I have considered all of the case law pertaining to summary judgment and I summarize the general principles accordingly: 
 
 
 
 1. the purpose of the provisions is to allow the Court to summarily dispense with cases which ought not proceed to trial because there is no genuine issue to be tried ( 
 Old Fish Market Restaurants Ltd. v. 1000357 Ontario Inc. et al 
 ); 
 
 
 
 2. there is no determinative test ( 
 Feoso Oil Ltd. v. Sarla (The) 
 ) but Stone J.A. seems to have adopted the reasons of Henry J. in  
 Pizza Pizza Ltd. v. Gillespie 
 . It is not whether a party cannot possibly succeed at trial, it is whether the case is so doubtful that it does not deserve consideration by the trier of fact at a future trial; 
 
 
 
 3. each case should be interpreted in reference to its own contextual framework ( 
 Blyth 
  and  
 Feoso 
 ); 
 
 
 
 4. provincial practice rules (especially Rule 20 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, [R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194] ) can aid in interpretation ( 
 Feoso 
  and  
 Collie 
 ); 
 
 
 
 5. this Court may determine questions of fact and law on the motion for summary judgment if this can be done on the material before the Court (this is broader than Rule 20 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure) ( 
 Patrick 
 ); 
 
 
 
 6. on the whole of the evidence, summary judgment cannot be granted if the necessary facts cannot be found or if it would be unjust to do so ( 
 Pallman 
  and  
 Sears 
 ); 
 
 
 
 7. in the case of a serious issue with respect to credibility, the case should go to trial because the parties should be cross-examined before the trial judge ( 
 Forde 
  and  
 Sears 
 ). 
  The mere existence of apparent conflict in the evidence does not preclude summary judgment; the court should take a "hard look" at the merits and decide if there are issues of credibility to be resolved ( 
 Stokes 
 ). [Emphasis added]
