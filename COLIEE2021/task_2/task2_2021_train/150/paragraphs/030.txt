  There are undoubtedly evidentiary difficulties for SOCAN. SOCAN appears to rely on hearsay to make its case on the merits. It will have to persuade a trial judge that such evidence is reliable and necessary. Those two criteria may be influenced by a consideration of who had the obligation to maintain evidence of performances which then ties in to what type of system is mandated for or by SOCAN. These are issues best left to a trial judge to decipher.
