  The Plaintiff, commonly known as SOCAN, is a collective society under section 67 of the  
 Copyright Act 
 , R.S. 1985, c. C-42 (Act). It administers the performance rights of virtually all copyright protected musical works in Canada. This is done through agreements with Canadian artists whereby members-artists assign their rights to SOCAN. SOCAN also has reciprocal agreements with similar performing rights organizations (PROs) in other countries. These agreements empower SOCAN to administer these PRO members' rights (essentially foreign artists) on their behalf. Even the nature and extent of SOCAN's mandate and the breadth of its coverage is at issue in this litigation. The Defendant even challenged the notion that SOCAN had reciprocal agreements with virtually all other PROs because 50 countries were not included - yet all the major countries are.
