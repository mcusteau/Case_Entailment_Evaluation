  Central to this litigation is the scheme of SOCAN's mandate and the rights and obligations which flow from the interpretation of that scheme. It controls or influences many, if not most, of the issues in this litigation including potentially the admissibility of hearsay. It is SOCAN's premise that as a self-reporting licensing royalty regime, the responsibility of reporting and thus of record keeping rests with those who may be liable for obtaining a licence and paying royalties. In this case, that responsibility falls to MLSE. 
 
 
 
 MLSE denies that SOCAN is required to have a self-reporting system and submits that SOCAN has the obligation to prove all the elements of its case; that there is no place for adverse inferences or reverse onus or similar concepts which place the legal burden on MLSE.
