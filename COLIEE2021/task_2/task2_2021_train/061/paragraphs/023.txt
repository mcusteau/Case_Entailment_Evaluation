  Further, I do not see how affording an applicant the opportunity of confronting discrepancies arising from information separately obtained, places any undue burden on immigration officers. That is not a complicated process. It only requires telling an applicant of the negative file information not obtained from him or her and contradictory statements made by the spouse of the applicant in his or her absence, and obtaining the applicant's explanation. While this may involve a certain expenditure of additional time by the immigration officer, it has not been demonstrated there is any additional cost or hardship involved. As I have indicated, if upon hearing the explanations the immigration officer is of the opinion that they are not credible, they may be rejected.
