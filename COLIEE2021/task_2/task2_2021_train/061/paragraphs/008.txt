  The applicant says she was not given an opportunity to address contradictions between her evidence and the evidence given by her spouse separately and negative information in the case file, all of which caused Ms. Mammoliti to conclude that the marriage was not bona fide. Discrepancies related to matters such as how the applicant and her spouse met and their wedding. The case file contained information about the applicant's failure to appear at inquiries. Counsel for the respondent agrees that the applicant was not given an opportunity to explain the contradictions or correct or explain information in the case file. However, he says that having regard to the nature of inquiries involving the bona fides of marriages for immigration purposes, it is not necessary and indeed, is counterproductive, to require an immigration officer to allow an applicant an opportunity to respond to apparent contradictions or address matters in the immigration file.
