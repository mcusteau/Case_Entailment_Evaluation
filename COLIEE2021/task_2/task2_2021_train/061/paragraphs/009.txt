  Counsel for the respondent also cited a line of authority of this court to the effect that because spousal interviews are quite special in their character, fairness does not require that an applicant be given the opportunity to respond to discrepancies between the spouses' interviews. See for example  
 Nagy v. The Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , IMM-1375-93, Tremblay-Lamer, J., March 11, 1994, F.C.T.D., not yet reported;  
 Adebiyi v. The Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1994), 73 F.T.R. 230 (T.D.); and  
 Singh v. The Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , T-2011-92, Pinard, J., October 8, 1994, F.C.T.D., not yet reported. These cases are all based on  
 Grewal v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1993), 62 F.T.R. 308 (T.D.).
