 [24] 
  I conclude, based upon my interpretation of  
 Shah 
 , that in denying the applicant the opportunity to deal with contradictions arising from the separate interviews of the applicant and her spouse and with negative information in the case file not originating with the applicant, the applicant was denied even the minimal procedural fairness that pertains to the humanitarian and compassionate procedure under s. 114(2) of the  
 Immigration Act 
 . This judicial review is allowed and the matter is returned for redetermination by an immigration officer other than those who have been involved in this case. The applicant will be afforded the opportunity of responding to discrepancies in the spousal interviews and to negative information in the case file.
