  I agree that separate spousal interviews are a special type of process geared to ascertaining the bona fides of a marriage, having regard to the credibility of the spouses. I am also aware that humanitarian and compassionate procedures can be the subject of abuse by deceitful applicants. However, I know of no principle of law which justifies departure from fundamental rules of fairness simply because credibility is at issue or because the issue is the bona fides of a marriage. Nor do I agree that the process would be frustrated by allowing applicants the opportunity to respond to discrepancies. Separate interviews are intended to avoid collusion between spouses and they are justified for this reason. But I do not see how the process is frustrated if an applicant is then confronted with discrepancies and granted an opportunity to respond to them. Even if the applicant attempts to "explain away" the discrepancies, it is always open to the immigration officer to reject the explanation, as was done in

 . On the other hand, denying the opportunity to respond invites a decision being made by an immigration officer on the basis of innocent discrepancies or a misunderstanding. That is why, in my view, procedural fairness requires an opportunity to respond to information not brought forward by the applicant.
