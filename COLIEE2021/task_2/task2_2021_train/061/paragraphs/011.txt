  The most recent authority of which I am aware with respect to the question of procedural fairness pertaining to humanitarian and compassionate reviews is  
 Shah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , A-617-92, Hugessen, J.A., June 24, 1994, F.C.A., not yet reported. [see (1994), 170 N.R. 238] In  
 Shah 
 , Hugessen, J.A., states that the content of the duty of fairness in humanitarian and compassionate reviews under s. 114(2) of the  
 Immigration Act 
  is minimal. He points out that no hearing need be held and no reasons need be given.
