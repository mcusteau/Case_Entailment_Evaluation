  In the case at bar, Immigration Officer Mammoliti called in the applicant and her spouse for separate interviews. The intention was to try to ascertain whether the marriage in question was bona fide or was entered into for immigration purposes. Separate interviews enable the immigration officer, without collusion of the spouses, to obtain information from each spouse pertaining to the marriage with a view to ascertaining whether the spouses are living together as husband and wife and whether the relationship has the attributes of a bona fide marriage.
