  Mr. Sylvester submitted an application for transportation security clearance on May 5, 2011 in order to work as a ramp attendant for Porter Airlines. Officials at the TSCP's Security Screenings Program [SSP] requested a records check from the RCMP. In January 2012, the RCMP responded with a written report stating that on September 22, 1999, Mr. Sylvester was charged with three counts of theft after contacting an undercover police officer to sell what he described as stolen clothes. A second individual provided further items of clothing on August 23, 1999 and indicated that a "Mike Sylvester" had stolen them with him while working as a ramp attendant for Canadian Airlines. The applicant met with the undercover agent on August 25, 1999 and collected payment for this second batch of items. The report further stated that on August 30, 1999, Mr. Sylvester arranged to meet an undercover officer to sell him a Sony PlayStation and several boxes of nail polish and that investigation revealed that these items had been stolen from Canadian Airlines by the applicant and another person while the applicant was employed there as a ramp attendant.
