  The fact that in the present case the charges were not proceeded upon because of credibility issues does not preclude the Minister from refusing a security clearance. In criminal matters, the onus on the Crown is higher, requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt for conviction. In this matter, the onus on the Minister requires only a reasonable belief on a balance of probabilities. In addition, the standard is considerably lower, requiring a conclusion only that the applicant may be  
 prone 
  or  
 induced to commit 
  an act that may interfere with civil aviation.
