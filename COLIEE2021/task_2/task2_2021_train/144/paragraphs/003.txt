  Under the  
 Aeronautics Act 
 , RSC 1985, c A-2, the Minister of Transport is responsible for developing policies and regulations to promote the security of Canada's aviation system. This department's current aviation security programs include the National Civil Aviation Security Program [NCASP], which articulates the efforts of Transport Canada and other entities to help prevent acts of unlawful interference and keep air travel secure. One element of the NCASP is the Transportation Security Clearance Program [TSCP]. This program prevents access into restricted areas of listed airports by any individual whom the Minister reasonably believes, on a balance of probabilities, may be prone or induced to commit an act that may unlawfully interfere with civil aviation. Section 4.8 of the  
 Aeronautics Act 
  authorizes the Minister to grant or refuse to grant a transportation security clearance in order to gain access to such areas.
