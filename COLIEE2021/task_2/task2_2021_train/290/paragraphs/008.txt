Dealing first with the argument that Union Oil Company of Canada Limited (supra) and Canadian Javelin Limited do not apply because the judgment creditor is not claiming relief against the Crown in right of Ontario, and the Crown is therefore not "impleaded" in the proceedings. As was stated in Sultan of Jahore v. Abubakar Tunku Aris Bendahar, [1952] A.C. 318, the word "impleaded" is capable of more than one meaning and it does not depend merely on an answer to the more technical question of whether a person is actually a party, or ought to be regarded as a necessary party to the proceedings. Stroud's Judicial Dictionary defines an impleading as occurring when a person is affected in his interests by the judgment of a court. The interests of the Crown in the right of Ontario, as a named garnishee in this case, would be affected by a judgment since it would be subject to both orders made by the court against it, and to the enforcement mechanisms provided for in the Federal Court Rules.
