  On February 1, 2007, Mr. Katwaru was arrested and detained for a removal to Guyana that was scheduled to take place on February 10, 2007. The following day, an officer with the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) refused to defer his removal. A stay of removal was then granted by this Court pending the determination of his application for leave and for judicial review of that decision.
