  Mr. Katwaru submits that the Director erred by overemphasizing his criminality. He asserts that his application should be distinguished from those made by persons who have never received permanent resident status in Canada. In this case, he states that he was applying for equitable relief, and that therefore different factors are relevant to the assessment. In particular, he submits that the factors to be considered are those that were established in  
 Ribic v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1985] I.A.B.D. No. 4 (I.A.B.), at para. 4, which were endorsed by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 1 F.C. 605; 234 N.R. 112 (F.C.A.), at para. 18. Those factors are: 
 
 
 
 1) the seriousness of the offence leading to the deportation order; 
 
 
 
 2) the possibility of rehabilitation and the risk of re-offending; 
 
 
 
 3) the length of time spent in Canada and the degree to which the applicant is established; 
 
 
 
 4) the family in Canada and the dislocation to family that would be caused by deportation; 
 
 
 
 5) the support available to the applicant within the family and the community; and 
 
 
 
 6) the degree of hardship that would be caused to the applicant by his return to the country of nationality.
