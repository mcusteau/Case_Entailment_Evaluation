  With respect to his status as a criminal deportee, the Director acknowledged his counsel's submissions that there is legislation in Guyana that would allow the police to monitor him and that the broad powers in that legislation are open to abuse by those who enforce them. However, she found that the reported possibility of such abuse was speculative and that Amnesty International's subsequent reports make no mention of those broad powers actually having been abused. She also noted that in more recent open source country condition materials there was little evidence of any police monitoring of criminal deportees. After quoting a U.S. article regarding the treatment of criminal deportees in Guyana, the Director concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Mr. Katwaru would be monitored or, if monitored, that he would be inappropriately treated by Guyanese authorities upon his return.
