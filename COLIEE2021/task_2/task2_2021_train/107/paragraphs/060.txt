  In my view, the Director's decision was certainly well within the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , above at para. 47), particularly given the "highly discretionary and fact-based nature" of the decision ( 
 Baker 
 , above, at para. 61). For the reasons I have explained, that decision also was transparent, intelligible and appropriately justified.
