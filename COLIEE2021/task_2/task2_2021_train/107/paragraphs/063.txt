 [63] 
  In the case at bar, there were a significant number of factors that weighed in favour of a positive determination of Mr. Katwaru's H&C application. However, on the whole, they were not materially different from the types of factors that are routinely identified by applicants in the H&C cases that come before this Court. Given the seriousness of the offence and the aggravating factors identified or recognized by the Director, it was not unreasonable for the Director to reject Mr. Katwaru's application, particularly having regard to the objectives of the  
 IRPA 
 , as discussed in  
 Medovarski 
  and  
 Cha 
 , above.
