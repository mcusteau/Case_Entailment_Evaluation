  With respect to the general risks identified by Mr. Katwaru, the Director did in fact explicitly address those risks over the course of almost two pages of her decision. Ultimately, she concluded: "No doubt these factors represent serious inconveniences, but there is insufficient evidence before me to demonstrate that these factors would directly impact Mr. Katwaru especially if he is quick to readopt Guyanese habits as outlined in the travel advisories." In my view, this conclusion is simply another way of stating that these general risks would not likely present  
 any 
  hardship for Mr. Katwaru, let alone "unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate" hardship.
