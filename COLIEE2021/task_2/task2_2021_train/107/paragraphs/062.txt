 , [2005] 2 S.C.R. 539; 339 N.R. 1; 2005 SCC 51, at para. 10). As the Federal Court of Appeal observed in  
 Cha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2007] 1 F.C.R. 409; 349 N.R. 233; 2006 FCA 126, at para. 24, "Parliament has made it clear that criminality of non-citizens is a major concern." The decisions in both  
 Medovarski 
  and  
 Cha 
  post-date the decisions relied upon by Mr. Katwaru.
