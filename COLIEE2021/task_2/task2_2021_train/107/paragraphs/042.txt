  The first two conditions in the foregoing list are not met because the alleged harmful information, namely, Mr. Katwaru's conviction for manslaughter and the circumstances surrounding the death of his son, is not of a confidential nature and has been in the public domain since 1998, when Mr. Katwaru was first convicted for manslaughter. The third condition in the foregoing list is also not met because, as discussed above, Mr. Katwaru has not established that he will suffer irreparable harm if the order he seeks is not granted. Indeed, essentially the same risks were considered and rejected by the PRRA Officer who rejected his PRRA application in 2005. In 2006, this Court dismissed Mr. Katwaru's application for judicial review of that decision. Finally, as noted above, the public interest in open court proceedings outweighs the weak private interests that Mr. Katwaru is seeking to protect.
