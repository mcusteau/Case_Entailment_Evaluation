  In August 1995, Mr. Katwaru and his former wife had a son who was born premature. After a four-month stay in the hospital, he was discharged. Following the receipt of information from his former wife that he was handling the child "in a rough manner," an investigation was commenced with the Children's Aid Society. A High Risk Infant Care Nurse was then assigned to the family. However, the intervention of professionals who regularly visited the home was not sufficient to stop Mr. Katwaru's systematic abuse of his son. In February 1996, at the age of five months, his son died.
