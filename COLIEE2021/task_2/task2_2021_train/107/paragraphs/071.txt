  The Director's use of the terms "risk" and "personalized risk," rather than the term "hardship," in various places appears to have simply resulted from an attempt to use terms employed in "the updated risk submissions" dated May 11, 2007 and October 28, 2008, submitted by Mr. Katwaru and referred to in his letter to PRRA Officer A. Dello, dated January 5, 2010, in which a number of those alleged "risks" were repeated.
