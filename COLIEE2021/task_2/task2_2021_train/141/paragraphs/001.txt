 O'Reilly, J. 
 : In 2001, Mr. Usman Ilahi, a citizen of Pakistan, applied to become a permanent resident in Canada as a skilled worker. He submitted his application to the Canadian visa office in Islamabad. He corresponded with the office on numerous occasions, updating his coordinates, paying the required fees and requesting an interview. In December 2005, an immigration officer informed Mr. Ilahi that he had failed to attend a scheduled interview and, based solely on a review of his supporting documents, that his application was denied.
