[5]
By order of this court dated September 28, 1979, and affirmed by the Court of Appeal on March 13, 1980, proceedings in this action were stayed pending the filing of a statement of claim amended so as to reflect the lack of jurisdiction of this court as against the two defendants Dr. Brennan and Dr. Medora. No steps were taken by the plaintiff in this regard.
