Furthermore, the affidavit evidence, particularly that of Mr. Donald Newman, Vice-President of Human Resources of Marine Atlantic Inc., as well as the negative business information report on the defendant companies prepared by Dunn and Bradstreet, confirm there is a genuine risk that, if successful, the plaintiff may be unable to execute judgment once obtained. The evidence suggests the defendant companies are experiencing increasing difficulty in meeting their financial obligations, they are the subject of other lawsuits and, if they lose this litigation, their chances of survival are slim. Indeed, the defendants could face the possibility of bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, there is the likely prospect that the Zodiacs and other assets of the defendants may be removed from the jurisdiction for use on international cruises. Cruises of that nature are part of the defendants' business and there is evidence that Mr. Blyth and his companies continue to advertise them.
