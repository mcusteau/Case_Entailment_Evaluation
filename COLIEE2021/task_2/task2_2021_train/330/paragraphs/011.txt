Based on the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing these conditions, as well as the existence of a strong prima facie case. There is no question the plaintiff has made full and frank disclosure and has set out the particulars of its claim against the defendants, nor is it disputed that the defendants have assets within the jurisdiction. In addition, the plaintiff has provided an undertaking that it would be liable for damages in the event this court should find that the defendants have suffered damages by reason of the grant of the injunction.
