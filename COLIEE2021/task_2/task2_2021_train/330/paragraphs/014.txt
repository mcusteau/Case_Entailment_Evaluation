Finally, I turn to the question of the defendants' application for an order pursuant to rule 415(3) of the
Federal Court Rules
requiring the plaintiff to provide a fair and substantial response to the allegations contained in the statement of defence and counterclaim. The plaintiff's position is that it has been unable to better respond to the allegations contained in the defendants' counterclaim because the pleading contains insufficient details of the facts upon which the claim is based. However, the plaintiff has also indicated its willingness to provide answers to questions raised by Mr. Blyth and so advised the defendants by letter dated September 20, 1993.
