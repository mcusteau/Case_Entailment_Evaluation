  The visa officer's concerns are outlined in the refusal letter dated April 30, 2002 after receiving an anonymous poison pen letter and the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) Record of Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus' sister's application for permanent residence of her spouse. As a result of the anonymous letter, the visa officer changed the positive decision, ordered the visa cancelled and a refusal letter be sent. The visa officer concluded that there was a possible fraud as Mr. Navarrete was accused of being the common-law spouse of Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus' sister whose IAD appeal was subsequently abandoned for failure to appear on September 9, 2003.
