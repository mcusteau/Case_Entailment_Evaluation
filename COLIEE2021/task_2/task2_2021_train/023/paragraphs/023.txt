  In deciding whether Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus had the intention of permanently residing with Mr. Navarrete, the Board must look at her intentions not Mr. Navarrete's beliefs or intentions. ( 
 Bisla 
 , above, at paras. 10 and 13) The Board conducted little if no assessment of her intentions at the time of the marriage, but rather considered Mr. Navarrete's present intentions to buy a house and the fact that he would consider moving to the Dominican Republic to be with Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus if she could not come to Canada.
