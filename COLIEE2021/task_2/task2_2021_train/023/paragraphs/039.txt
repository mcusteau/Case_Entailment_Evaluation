  In this case, the two sisters (Maria and Gleidys) married on the same day in Santo Domingo. Mr. Navarrete testified that in June or July 2000, Ms. Gleidys De Jesus told him not to tell Ms. Maria Roselina De Jesus that she too planned to get married on the same day in November 2000. Mr. Navarrete testified that he did not find the matter of importance to him as he finds the family a little strange. The Board accepted this explanation as "unusual but not unreasonable in all the circumstances." Mr. Navarrete's explanation is hardly in harmony with the evidence and is actually inconsistent with his own evidence - given that the Board also accepted his testimony that he really likes Ms. De Jesus' family and finds them "down to earth".
