  As I examine the parties' claims, I will therefore bear in mind that the standard of review varies according to the nature of the issues raised. Before doing so, however, it would be appropriate to reproduce the relevant statutory provision, section 109 of the Act: 
 
 
 
 109.(1) The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter. 
 
 
 
 (2) The Refugee Protection Division may reject the application if it is satisfied that other sufficient evidence was considered at the time of the first determination to justify refugee protection. 
 
 
 
 (3) If the application is allowed, the claim of the person is deemed to be rejected and the decision that led to the conferral of refugee protection is nullified.
