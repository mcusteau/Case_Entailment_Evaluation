  With regard to the burden of proof, case law has clearly established that the burden of proof is on the Minister when he wants to have someone's refugee status vacated. He must convince the Board, on the balance of probabilities, that the person whose status he is challenging misrepresented or withheld some facts in his original claim (Canada (M.C.I.) v. Ekuban, [2001] 3 F.C. 85; Olutu v. Canada (M.C.I.), [1996] F.C.J. No. 1704; Kahin v. Canada (M.C.I.), (1995), 91 F.T.R. 46).
