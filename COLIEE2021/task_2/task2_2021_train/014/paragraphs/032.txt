  In this very special context, I find that the Board erred in attributing no credibility to the applicant mainly because her and her father's names were not always spelled the same way, her memories of the town where she was allegedly born were not always consistent with those of her sister and she did not know where her father was born. While it is true that the Board relied on other evidence to conclude the applicant was not credible, if we discard the erroneous findings with respect to the applicant's Djiboutian nationality and the discrepancies in her testimony, which can be explained by the factors mentioned above, I feel that these other elements would not have led the Board to find that the applicant's version of the facts was not credible.
