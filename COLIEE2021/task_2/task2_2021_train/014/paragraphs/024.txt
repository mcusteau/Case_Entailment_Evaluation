  According to counsel for the Minister, it should be assumed that the Board was conscious that the burden of proof was on the Minister, since it continually referred to her as the applicant and allowed the so-called application in its conclusion.

Moreover, I cannot help but notice that the decision reads exactly the same way as a decision on an original refugee claim.
