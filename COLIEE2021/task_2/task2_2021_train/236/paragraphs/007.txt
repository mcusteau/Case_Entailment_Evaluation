Under section 20 of the
Act
, a trademark is deemed to have been infringed when a person not entitled to its use sells, distributes or advertises wares or services in association with a confusing trademark or tradename. In the case at bar, according to the evidence in the record, between August 17, 2001 and January 2, 2002, the defendant Mitchell Levine operated a sole proprietorship under the tradename BIO-LAWN, as appears in a certified copy of registration No. 110872330 pursuant to the
Business Names Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. B-17. Subsequently, on January 2, 2002, the defendant Mitchell Levine incorporated his business under the
Business Corporations Act
, R.S.O. 1990, c. B-16, and the tradename of the business was Bio-Lawn Ltd., as appears in the "Corporation Profile Report". In October 2002, the plaintiff through its counsel notified the latter that the tradename had to be changed. A further notification was sent to the defendants in March 2003 requiring them to cease using the trademark BIO-LAWN and any other mark confusing therewith. Use of the trademark BIO-LAWN in association with the sale of fertilizer was also carried out by the defendant on its Internet site and on its vehicle with advertising signs. On June 20, 2003, after the action at bar was served, the defendant Bio-Lawn Ltd. changed its tradename to that of Bio-Lawncare Services Inc. Additionally, according to the evidence in the record, the defendant Bio-Lawncare Services Inc. presented itself to the public on the Internet site as a division of MRL Horticultural Services, and this explains why the latter was added as a defendant.
