  The unanimous decision in  
 Ward 
  comprises the Supreme Court of Canada's seminal statement on refugee protection law. In the decision, the Court sets out clear criteria to be applied when a person claims protection from Canada. The critical paragraphs of Justice La Forest's decision are quoted in the Appendix to these reasons, from which the following instructive points can be stated: 
 
 
 
 1. The evidentiary burden rests with a claimant to establish a well-founded prospective fear of persecution, on both subjective and objective grounds, if returned to his or her country of origin. It is presumed that, if his or her state is unable to provide  
 effective protection 
 , the objective element of the burden is discharged (paragraphs 45 and 52). 
 
 
 
 2. The state of origin is presumed to be capable of protecting its citizens, and the claimant bears the evidentiary burden of rebutting this presumption on the basis of  
 some clear and convincing evidence 
  (paragraphs 50 and 52). For example, the evidence can include descriptions of other similarly situated persons not having received protection, and the claimant's own testimony of having attempted to access the state's protection, but that protection did not materialize (paragraphs 50 and 52). 
 
 
 
 3. When, on the evidence, it is found to be objectively reasonable for a claimant to have sought state protection, a claimant must have approached the state for protection. However, when, on the evidence, it is found that it is unreasonable to expect the claimant to approach the state, the claimant's failure to do so will not defeat his or her claim (paragraph 49).
