  On the re-determination, I direct that a differently constituted panel of the RPD is required to apply the principles of law above described, and, in addition, is required to evaluate the evidence, including the Applicant's conduct in seeking state protection, in a contextual analysis in conformity with the  
 Gender Guidelines 
 . As I agree with Counsel for the Applicant that it is unfair to the Applicant to be required to prove her credibility on the re-determination when no negative credibility finding was made in the decision under review, I further direct that the re-determination be conducted on the evidence in the existing record, and the Applicant's evidence already given be accepted as credible. However, I also direct that, on the re-determination, the Applicant is at liberty to supply any further elaborating evidence, and any new argument, as she might consider necessary.
