  ( 
 Gender Guidelines 
 ) agrees:

 , [1999] F.C.J. No. 1438; 175 F.T.R. 116 (T.D.), at para. 15: 
 
 
 
 "Ability of a state to protect must be seen to comprehend not only the existence of an effective legislation and procedural framework but the  
 capacity and the will to effectively implement that framework.
