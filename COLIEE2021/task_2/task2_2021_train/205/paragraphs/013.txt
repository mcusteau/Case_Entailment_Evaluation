 [13] 
  With respect to statement [4], the use of "serious efforts" in this sentence is equated to a state's "due diligence" efforts to provide practical state protection. However, there is a sharp difference between due diligence in developing policy and giving education on a certain issue, and putting the policy or education into actual operation. This point has particular importance to protection against violence against women if the sentence under consideration is extended to contexts other than terrorism.
