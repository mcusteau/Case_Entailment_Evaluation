  On the issue of state protection, the Applicant argues that, while the RPD is correct in applying the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321 ( 
 Ward 
 ), the decision under review is in reviewable error because the RPD fails to correctly determine the effect of  
 Ward 
  on other precedents with respect to the issue of state protection. I agree with this argument. The analysis which leads to this conclusion has four components: the RPD's findings of fact; the RPD's findings of law; my opinion on the correct state of the law; and findings of reviewable error in the RPD's decision. In addition, the issues of directions on the re-determination and costs are addressed.
