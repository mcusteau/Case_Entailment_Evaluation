 : first, a democratic state cannot guarantee the protection of all of its citizens at all times; and, second, in order for a claimant to discharge the evidentiary burden of establishing that his or her state is unable to provide effective protection, it is just not enough to prove that the state has "not always been effective", that is, it has failed more than once to protect persons in the claimant's particular situation. The first statement is understandable without knowing the context, and is an obvious fact of life. However, the second statement requires cautious application. It can be fairly argued that the statement might apply in some or most claims, but whether it applies in any given claim depends upon an evaluation of the context in which that particular claim arises. That is, whether one failure, a few failures, or a number of failures, arising in a particular context is proven inability is a conclusion for a decision-maker to draw on the evidence presented.
