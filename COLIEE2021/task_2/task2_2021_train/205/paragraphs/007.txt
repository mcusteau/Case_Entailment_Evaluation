  The RPD denied the Applicant's claim on the basis of the following statements: 
 
 
 
 "The claimant has failed to rebut with clear and convincing evidence the presumption that the constitutional federal republic of Brazil is capable of providing protection for its citizens. There was no evidence provided that the government of Brazil is in chaos or disarray and unable to govern. 
 
 
 
 [. . . . .] 
 
 
 
 "I find that her efforts to avail herself of state protection falls far short of a diligent attempt prior to seeking asylum abroad and does not rebut the presumption that the state can protect its citizens ( 
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 at 726). The claimant made no effort to approach higher authorities in Sao Paulo or to ascertain if the investigation and failure to prosecute Silva was limited to a certain officer ( 
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Kadenko 
  (1996), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 532). The claimant provided no evidence that the government of Brazil is in disarray and unable to govern and as perfect protection ( 
 Zalzali v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1991] 3 F.C. 605 (F.C.A.) and protection for all citizens at all times ( 
 Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Villafranca 
  (1992), 18 Imm. L.R. (2d) 130), is not the criteria for adequate protection." (Tribunal Decision, pp. 4-5)
