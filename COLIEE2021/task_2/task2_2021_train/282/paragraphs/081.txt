The RPD's findings on credibility are cumulative and not all of them can be classified as unreasonable. However, reviewing the Decision as a whole it is obvious that the RPD placed a great deal of emphasis on the ECL matter and the general documentation which it says does not corroborate police and government mistreatment of UKPNP members and activists. This being the case, the RPD should have brought the ECL concerns to the Applicant's attention and allowed him to provide his explanation and it should have addressed the documentation that contradicts its own conclusions.
