As the RPD makes clear at paragraph 29 of the Decision, the credibility findings are cumulative but the main problem is that "the claimant lacks credibility respecting the central elements of his refugee protection claim - specifically that I do not believe that the police and other state agents in Pakistan or Azad Kashmir arrested, detained and tortured him in December 2005 and January 2006 - and that there is currently a FIR and Warrant of Arrest issued against him because of his UKPNP membership and political activities in Azad Kashir."
