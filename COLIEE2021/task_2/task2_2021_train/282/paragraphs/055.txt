In
Duarte v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 1259, the Federal Court held that it was reasonable for the RPD to consider the Applicant's 11-month delay in submitting a refugee claim. The Respondent submits that the present case is similar to
Duarte
in that the Applicant did not provide any evidence to explain the delay.
