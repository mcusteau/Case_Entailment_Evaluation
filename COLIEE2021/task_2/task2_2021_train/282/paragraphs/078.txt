The second issue of concern arises in relation to paragraphs 26 and 27 of the Decision and the RPD's finding that the documentary evidence "does not corroborate police and government mistreatment of UKPNP members and activists in Azad Kashmir":
Based upon this very recent documentary evidence on the UKPNP in Pakistan, had UKPNP members such as the claimant been the ongoing victims of police and other state agents in Pakistan while the claimant was residing in Azad Kashmir between August 4, 2004 and April 28, 2006, I find it implausible that such incidents would not be reported in the substantive documentary evidence before me on the political situation in Pakistan, particularly in POK or Azad Kashmir.
