The Applicant's third issue is that the RPD failed to observe the principles of natural justice in this case.
Mainville v. Canada (Attorney General),
[2007] F.C.J. No. 323 at paragraph 9 states:
So far as questions regarding procedural fairness or the principles of natural justice are concerned, it is not necessary to discuss the applicable standard of review: if those principles have been violated, the decision will be set aside and returned to the Minister for reconsideration.
Alternatively,
Jayasinghe v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2007] F.C.J. No. 275 (F.C.) states at paragraph 17 that whether a breach of natural justice has occurred is a question of law, reviewable on a standard of correctness:
Harb v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
2003 FCA 39 and
Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247 at paragraphs 55-56.
