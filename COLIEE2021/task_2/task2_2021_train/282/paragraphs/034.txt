In addition, the RPD found that there was insufficient documentary evidence to prove that UKPNP members and activists in Azad Kashmir are persecuted in Pakistan. However, the RPD did find that, according to the documentary evidence, it was reported that Sardar Shaukhat Ali Kashmiri was the leader and Chairman of the UKPNP until he was exiled in 1999, and that he had been arrested and tortured by Pakistani forces on two occasions. The RPD did not believe, however, that UKPNP members were arrested or detained by the Pakistan authorities after the October 1999 coup or the 1997 protests because that information did not appear in the documentary evidence. Similarly, the RPD did not believe that UKPNP members were the ongoing victims of persecution by the state because the Applicant did not have documentary evidence to prove it.
