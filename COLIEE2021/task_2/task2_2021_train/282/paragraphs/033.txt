[33]
Based upon the Applicant's delay in producing key documents and the ease with which such documents can be obtained in Pakistan, the RPD made the following finding:
I prefer the foregoing documentary evidence to the claimant's evidence, as it comes from an independent and reliable source with no interest in the outcome of these proceedings. Given this documentary evidence and my adverse credibility findings, I find that the FIR, the Warrant of Arrest and the letter from the lawyer in District Poonch, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan that the claimant has submitted to the Board are not authentic and genuine, and therefore I attach no weight to these documents as corroborative evidence of police or government interest in the claimant in Pakistan.
