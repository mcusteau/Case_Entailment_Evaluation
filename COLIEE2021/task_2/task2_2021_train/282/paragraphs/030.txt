Fourthly, the Applicant testified that he used his passport to leave Pakistan on April 28, 2006 and claimed that he had no trouble leaving the country. The RPD found that the documentary evidence on security measures in Pakistan indicated that everyone who leaves Pakistan from an airport must go through the Personal Identification, Security, Comparison and Evaluation System (PISCES). As a person wanted for political reasons, the RPD decided that the Applicant would have been on the Exit Control List (ECL) as a "wanted criminal or individual under investigation." The Applicant therefore would have been prevented from leaving the country or at least questioned by the authorities. The RPD concluded that the Applicant was not wanted by the Pakistan police or other state agencies for political reasons.
