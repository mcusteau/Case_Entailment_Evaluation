The Respondent submits that the RPD did not misconstrue the evidence in the present case. The RPD was not required to mention all of the evidence in its Decision, and its failure to do so is not grounds for judicial review: see
Woolaston v. Canada (Minister of Manpower and Immigration)
, [1972] S.C.J. No. 79 (S.C.C.) which states at paragraph 9:
The fact that it was not mentioned in the Board's reasons is not fatal to its decision. It was in the record to be weighed as to its reliability and cogency along with the other evidence in the case, and it was open to the Board to discount it or believe it.
