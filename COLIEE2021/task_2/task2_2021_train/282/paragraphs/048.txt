The Applicant also submits that the RPD drew inferences that were not supported by evidence. The RPD's conclusion that the Applicant's testimony that he was arrested, detained and tortured by the police in POK or Pakistan in December 2005 and January 2006 lacked credibility was mere speculation. In his PIF, the Applicant described how he was illegally detained on December 20, 2005 at the Thorar police station for more than 8 hours before he was released with a warning. He was illegally detained again on January 8, 2006 at the Thorar police station where he was kept for two days. The police held him responsible for creating unrest and he was warned to cease posting pro-independent Kashmir slogans and to be loyal to the government and the Pakistan army. The Applicant was tortured, beaten and humiliated on this occasion.
