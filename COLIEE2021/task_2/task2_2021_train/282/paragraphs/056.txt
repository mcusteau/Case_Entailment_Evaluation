The Respondent also submits that the RPD properly considered the Applicant's testimony that the police detained him on December 8, 2005 and January 8, 2005. However, this evidence was outweighed by the fact that the Applicant could have left Pakistan earlier because he had a valid passport from Pakistan and visitors visas for the United States and the United Kingdom. The Respondent argues that the RPD has the discretion to assess and weigh the significance of an applicant's failure to make a claim elsewhere, and that where the RPD issues a decision that is reasonably open to it on the evidence that decision is neither perverse or capricious:
