b. The RPD failed to consider two newspaper articles that reported how the poster campaign led to the charges laid against the Applicant;
c. The RPD failed to consider the August 22, 2006 letter from the Applicant's wife because the RPD assumed that the letter was from the Applicant's brother;
d. The RPD failed to consider the documentary evidence written by
Human Rights Watch.
