[46]
The Applicant points out that the RPD was silent concerning the above noted evidence and submits that the Decision was made "without regard to the evidence":
Bains v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 497 (F.C.T.D.). Moreover, the Applicant relies upon
Mahanandan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1228 (F.C.A.) at paragraph 8 for the following:
Where, as here, documentary evidence of the kind in issue here is received in evidence at a hearing which could conceivably affect the Board's appreciation of an Appellant's claim to be a Convention refugee, it seems to us that the Board is required to go beyond a bare acknowledgment of its having been received and to indicate, in its reasons, the impact, if any, that such evidence had upon the Applicant's claim. As I have already said, the Board failed to do so in this case. This, in our view was a fatal omission, as a result of which the decision cannot stand.
