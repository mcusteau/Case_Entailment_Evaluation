 [25] 
  In this decision, the Federal Court of Appeal reaffirmed the principle set out in Arica v. Canada (M.E.I.), [1995] F.C.J. No. 670 (F.C.A)(QL) that the RDP has the discretion to decide whether are not it would notify the Minister when an issue of exclusion arose during a hearing, and that the absence of the Minister did not alter the right of the RPD to determine this issue.
