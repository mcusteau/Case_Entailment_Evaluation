  The applicant, before Blais J. in Pushpanatham, above, had raised the same argument that the applicant raises here, that is that the LTTE does not engage solely and exclusively in crimes against humanity or terrorism. Therefore, it cannot be an organization with a limited and brutal purpose. This argument was rejected because there was no evidence to suggest that the LTTE's terrorist activities can be separated from other objectives it may have. The Court said "that the LTTE resorts to terrorist methods to reach their objectives and this suggests the LTTE is an organization with a brutal and limited purpose".
