  I say this because it must be kept in mind that one should assess the nature of an organization on the basis of its activities at the time the particular claimant was allegedly involved. If for example the LTTE had been a peaceful organization between 1986 and 1995, the relevant period in this case, it would be irrelevant that it became a terrorist organization after the claimant ceased to be involved with it. In the same way, it would also be irrelevant if an organization with a brutal and limited purpose became a peaceful organization or a purely political organization after a claimant ceased its relationship with it.
