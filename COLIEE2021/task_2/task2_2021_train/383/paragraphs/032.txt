[32]
The applicant makes a brief argument regarding a typo (claimants, plural, instead of claimant, singular, in the decision), stating that this section of the reasons may have been taken from another case. The applicant cites Bojaxhi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 516, which states, at para 12, that the Court will not correct an error that goes to the heart of the decision, when the Board has not taken steps to make the amendments required to correct the problem.
