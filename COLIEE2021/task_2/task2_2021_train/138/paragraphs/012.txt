 [12] 
  The Applicant's second application was allowed. The "fast-track" provisions, a program which allows for a finding of disability to be made up to 12 months prior to the receipt of the application, resulted in the Applicant's claim being backdated to March 2002, 12 months prior to the protected date. Disability payments commenced in April 2002. The Applicant was informed of this decision on April 3, 2004. He continues to receive these benefits today.
