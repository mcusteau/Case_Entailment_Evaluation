  On January 26, 1998, the Applicant's wife, who was also receiving  
 CPP 
  disability benefits, informed the Respondent that she and her husband were considering starting a business. On February 25, 1998, the Respondent sent a Disability Reassessment Questionnaire and an Authorization to Disclose Medical Information to the Applicant. The forms were not received because of a change of address and were re-sent on March 26, 1998. The Applicant sought clarification in respect of these forms and eventually the Applicant's wife informed the Respondent that the Applicant was working at that time as a Life Insurance Policy Salesman and doing well.
