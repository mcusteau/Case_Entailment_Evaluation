The factual background leading up to the decision in question is as follows. The Applicants are a married couple and their two children. They arrived in Canada at Gander, Newfoundland during the summer and autumn of 1989 on two separate flights that directly or indirectly originated in Poland, their native land. They claimed Convention refugee status. The Applicants moved to the Hamilton, Ontario area. On the 27th day of August, 1990 their Convention refugee claims were rejected by the Convention Refugee Determination Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board and leave to appeal that decision was later denied. In February, 1991, leave on humanitarian and compassionate grounds to apply for landing from within Canada was rejected at St. John's Newfoundland.
