It is trite law that judicial review of a decision of a federal board, commission or other tribunal should proceed on the basis of the evidence that was before the decision-maker. It is obvious that Dr. Newhouse's report post-dated the decision in question and thus constituted evidence not before the decision-maker. I sustained the objection. The judicial review thus proceeded on the basis only of evidence that was before the decision-maker.
