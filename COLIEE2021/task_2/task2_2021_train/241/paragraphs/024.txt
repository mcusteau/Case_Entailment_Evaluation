Not having found a basis to this point for returning this matter for reconsideration, I find myself in the same position as Cullen, J., in the
Nueda
case cited above when he stated at page 7 of his reasons:
"And finally, not having found a basis for returning this review, I now turn to counsel for the applicant's submission that this Court is under an obligation or duty, in cases where a prima facie case of a
Charter
infringement has been made out, to substantively review the decision, above and beyond the common law grounds of review."
