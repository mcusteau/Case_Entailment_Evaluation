It is clear that the Associate Chief Justice in
Ho v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1986), 6 F.T.R. 78 (F.C.T.D.), understood that that was the basis of the
Sivacilar
decision. The argument in front of him, as I understand his decision, was that the wife's withdrawal of her support for the application altered the applicant's status and his right to have his application for landing considered. He indicated that, that was not the case.
"The facts are identical to those in
Sivacilar
and I consider myself bound by the
Sivacilar
decision. The proper conclusion here is that Kwong Man Ho retains the right to perfect his application from within Canada, exempt from the provisions of s. 9 of the
Act
, a right which cannot be taken from him by any withdrawal of sponsorship on the part of his wife. ... There will ... be an order by way of mandamus directing the respondents to process such application form within Canada in accordance with existing law and regulations. The outcome of any such application is not my concern and any order purporting to direct a result of that application would be inappropriate."
