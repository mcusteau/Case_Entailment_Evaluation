  The Citizenship Judge did not believe that the Applicant had never been absent from Canada during the Period. He so concluded because the Applicant was only employed for sixteen months in Canada during the Period and earned only $25,201, because he had a sister who lived in Long Island, NY, whose telephone number he had provided on his citizenship application as his "home" number, because one of the letters from a landlord did not appear to be signed, because he had no immediate family in Canada and because a phone number he had subsequently provided on his Residence Questionnaire proved to be unlisted.
