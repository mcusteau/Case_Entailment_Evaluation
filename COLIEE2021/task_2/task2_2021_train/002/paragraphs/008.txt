 [8] 
  Although the Applicant brought an interpreter to the hearing, he did not often ask for his assistance. For the most part, the Applicant elected to make his submissions and answer the Court's questions without the interpreter's help. Once or twice, the Court asked the interpreter to translate a question or a text from a document to ensure that the Applicant understood. I am satisfied that the Applicant fully comprehended the proceeding. His manner throughout was somewhat frantic but not confused and always polite.
