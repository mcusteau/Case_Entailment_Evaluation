 Simpson, J. 
 : Zhijun Zheng is a self-represented applicant (the Applicant). He describes his application as one for judicial review but, in fact, it is an appeal under subsection 14(5) of the  
 Citizenship Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 (the Act). The appeal is from a decision of a Citizenship Judge dated June 19, 2006 (the Decision) in which he concluded that he did not believe the Applicant's evidence about the time he spent as a resident of Canada.
