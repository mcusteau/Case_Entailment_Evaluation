  The Residence Questionnaire listed documents to be provided and the Applicant was given extra time to have income tax returns prepared in support of his application. The Applicant says that because he was not asked for more information, he assumed that the material he provided was satisfactory. He complains that he was not given an opportunity to provide additional material. However, the Citizenship Judge is not obligated to provide an applicant with a running commentary about the adequacy of his documentation. The onus is on the applicant to establish residence. Once the applicant completes his case by submitting his documents, the Citizenship Judge considers the material and makes a ruling which is final subject only to an appeal. I have found no unfairness in this process.
