 [10] 
  The Citizenship Officer who interviewed the Applicant on July 12, 2005 made notes on Part 1 of the Citizenship Application Review form. The form shows that he recorded the 1099 days of residence which the Applicant had declared. However, the Officer is not empowered to make a decision about either the accuracy of the declared days or whether the Applicant met the residency requirements under paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act. Accordingly, the fact that he recorded the Applicant's declared days did not mean that the Applicant had met the residency requirements. For this reason, it was lawful to send the Applicant a Residence Questionnaire and lawful for the Applicant's application to be referred to a hearing before a Citizenship Judge.
