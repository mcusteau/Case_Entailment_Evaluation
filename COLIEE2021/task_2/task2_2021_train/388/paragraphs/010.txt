In my view, simply asking the right question is not enough to conclude that the adjudicator was acting within his jurisdiction. The answer to that question must be supported by the evidence. If the answer to the "right question" is simply unsustainable by any interpretation of the evidence, the adjudicator committed an interjurisdictional error. In the alternative, if the answer to the question is unsupported by the evidence, it is patently unreasonable. Using either standard, the decision of this adjudicator cannot be allowed to stand.
