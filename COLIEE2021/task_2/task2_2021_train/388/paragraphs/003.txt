The decision subject to judicial review arises from a complaint filed by Anil Jindal ("the respondent") against the Atomic Energy Commission Ltd. ("the AECL" or "the applicant"). (The decision of the adjudicator is exhibit "A" to the affidavit of Peter James Macmillan, applicant's Application Record, tab 2). The respondent was notified on April 2, 1992 that he would no longer be employed by AECL. The letter of dismissal states, in part:
"The consolidation of all marketing and sales functions in the company under the one organizational unit has resulted in a reduction of positions devoted to these functions. In this regard, I regret to inform you that your employment with AECL is terminated effective 1992 April 30."
Mr. Jindal submitted that his dismissal was wrongful and sought reinstatement.
