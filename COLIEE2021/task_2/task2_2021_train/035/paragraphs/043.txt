  Justice Addy was sensitive to the principle of "complete openness of the judicial process" even prior to the important decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Dagenais et al. 
 , [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835; 175 N.R. 1; 76 O.A.C. 81 and  
 R. v. Mentuck (C.G.) 
 , [2001] 3 S.C.R. 442; 277 N.R. 160; 163 Man.R.(2d) 1; 269 W.A.C. 1; 2001 SCC 76. He was also conscious of the balancing required between the competing interests of public access to the courts and the secrecy that might be required to protect national security (

 "... Public interest in the administration of justice requires complete openness of the judicial process. ... That cardinal rule ... is fundamental to the public interest in the preservation of our free and democratic society. There are, however, very limited and well defined occasions where that principle of complete openness must play a secondary role and where, with regard to the admission of evidence, the public interest in not disclosing the evidence may outweigh the public interest in disclosure. This frequently occurs where national security is involved. ..."
