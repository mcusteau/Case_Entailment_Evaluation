 [56] 
  I have considered the disclosure of a summary or of a portion of the grey-marked information. Such an exercise cannot be done without risking the person of interest being able to identify himself from the information in issue. This is particularly so because of the information in paragraphs 28 and 28.A previously made public. In the circumstances, the interests of national security outweigh the competing public interest. No further disclosures will be authorized concerning these paragraphs.
