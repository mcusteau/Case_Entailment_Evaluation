  When Justice Dorval issued the search warrants in January 2002, she knew of the original Durno orders but in all likelihood could not have been aware of the delay orders. In view of Justice Dorval's conclusion that much of the information in Appendix "D" could not be disclosed because of the ongoing investigation and in view of the delay orders, I was satisfied that the information in issue should not have been disclosed until the delay orders expired or were otherwise modified by a judge or court with jurisdiction under the  
 Criminal Code
