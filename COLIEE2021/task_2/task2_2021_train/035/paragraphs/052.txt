  The privilege belongs to the Crown and to the informant, even the anonymous informant. Courts must take great care not to unwittingly deprive informers of the privilege. In the case of an anonymous informant, none of the information should be disclosed, subject only to "the innocence at stake" exception. See:  
 Leipert 
  at paragraphs 15, 16 and 32. The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Leipert 
  makes no explicit reference to the balancing test envisaged in the  
 Canada Evidence Act 
 .
