 [50] 
  The Attorney General of Canada continues to assert his objection to the disclosure of the information still in issue for one of two grounds. In his view, the disclosure of the information would breach either the informer privilege, including the concern not to reveal the identity of persons of interest, or the third party rule. On the records filed with the Court, this information still in issue has been grey-marked (the grey-marked information).
