  After a careful review of the affidavit and oral evidence of the witnesses, I am satisfied that the Canadian agencies were aware of the information in this paragraph, prior to whatever other information may have been received from one or more foreign agencies. Again, on my review of the record, the third party rule has no bearing on this paragraph. No other national security interest has been invoked by the Attorney General of Canada which, in my view, would support the non-disclosure of the grey-marked information, surely not one which outweighs the public interest in releasing the information. Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada did not appear to take issue with this conclusion in comments she made on July 19, 2006. An order to this effect will issue.
