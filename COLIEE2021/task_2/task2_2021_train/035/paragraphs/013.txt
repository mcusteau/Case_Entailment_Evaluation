 [13] 
  On June 24, 2005, after receiving submissions concerning the Ontario Court of Appeal decisions, Justice Dorval delivered oral reasons and concluded: 
 
 
 
 "Although the court did not deal with my reasons of January 4th, 2005, I must conclude that the intent of the order remains to release the names of the subject of the search warrants and ban publication of those names or any information which may tend to identify them. I therefore do so, subject to the s. 38 application before the Federal Court." 
 
 
 
 Justice Dorval's reasons of January 4, 2005 are a corrigendum of her decision first issued on December 17, 2004, above at paragraph 4. Those reasons were not the subject of the Ontario Court of Appeal decisions of June 3 and 9, 2005.
