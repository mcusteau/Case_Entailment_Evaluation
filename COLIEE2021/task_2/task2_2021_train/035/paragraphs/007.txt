  On April 29, 2005, the Attorney General of Canada forwarded to the Federal Court his own redacted version of the documents in issue. This made clear to the Court and the applicants those portions of the documents in issue concerning which the Attorney General of Canada continued to assert a privilege under section 38 in this proceeding (the information in issue), despite Justice Dorval's decision to release the information. The Attorney General of Canada's ongoing objection reactivated this section 38 proceeding, the possibility envisaged in paragraph 22 of my reasons for order of July 30, 2004, above at paragraph 2.
