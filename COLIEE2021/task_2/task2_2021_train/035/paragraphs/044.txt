  In 2004, in the context of a criminal investigation concerning terrorism, the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Vancouver Sun (Re) 
  highlighted the principle of openness in court proceedings (at paragraph 26): 
 
 
 
 "The open court principle is inextricably linked to the freedom of expression protected by s. 2(b) of the  
 Charter 
  and advances the core values therein: ... The freedom of the press to report on judicial proceedings is a core value. Equally, the right of the public to receive information is also protected by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of expression: ... The press plays a vital role in being the conduit through which the public receives that information regarding the operation of public institutions: ... Consequently, the open court principle, to put it mildly, is not to be lightly interfered with." (Citations omitted)
