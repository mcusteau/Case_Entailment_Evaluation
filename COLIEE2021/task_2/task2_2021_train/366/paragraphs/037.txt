In concluding, it is worth repeating the pivotal statements in the decision of the Citizenship judge, supra, paragraph 6. He acknowledges that a centralization of one's mode of living in Canada may allow temporary absences without breaching para­graph 5(1)(c). This appears to reflect the principle in

He then states: "[a] review of the facts of your case and the relevant case law has led me to conclude that you did not maintain sufficient ties with Canada during your absences to have those substantive absences count as periods of residence under the

Koo, Re
in his assessment of the facts. These two errors require this court's intervention.
