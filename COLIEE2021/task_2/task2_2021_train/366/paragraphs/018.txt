The
Citizenship Act
contains no privative clause. [see footnote 18] The statutory right of appeal from a decision of a citizenship judge to the Federal Court - Trial Division is comprehensive and not subject to leave. The right of judicial review of a decision of the Convention Refugee Determination Division is subject to leave. [see footnote 19] The judgment of the Federal Court - Trial Division sitting in appeal from a decision of the citizenship judge is, "notwithstanding any other Act of Parliament", not appealable. [see footnote 20] This court's decision on an application for judicial review in any immigration or refugee matter may be appealed where the judge certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved. [see footnote 21]
