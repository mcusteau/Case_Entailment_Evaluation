Koo, Re
, supra, paragraph 13, Justice Reed raised as one of the relevant criteria whether the absence from Canada may have been caused "... by a clearly temporary situation such as employment as a missionary abroad, following a course of study abroad as a student, accepting temporary employment abroad, [and] ac­companying a spouse who has accepted temporary employment abroad". [see foot­note 41] The applicant's situation, on the basis of her information to the Citizenship judge, her husband's affidavit and the letter from Greenpeace, falls squarely within this criteria.
