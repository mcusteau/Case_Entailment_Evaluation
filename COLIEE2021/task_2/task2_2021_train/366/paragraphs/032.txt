To repeat, this citizenship appeal is being heard during a unique period of likely transition. In the words of Justice Muldoon in
Harry, Re
, "[t]he judicial administration of [this statutory test] ... has been vexed for two decades". [see footnote 40] The legal test is confused by the conflicting juris足prudence. The appeal now proceeds as an application. There is no evidence that citizenship judges have conducted their proceedings differently since the introduction of this court's new
Rules
. The absence of a record disclosing the oral information shared with the citizenship judge is more prob足lematic with the repeal of the trial de novo. The decisions under appeal do not always make clear which of this court's conflicting case law is being followed. Parliament's consideration of Bill C-63 may bring sig足nificant changes to the examination and determination of citizenship applications and the review of the resulting decisions. In short, even though the objective factors might dictate more deference to the decisions of citizenship judges, this is neither the time nor the environment in which to depart radically from the current standard of re足view.
