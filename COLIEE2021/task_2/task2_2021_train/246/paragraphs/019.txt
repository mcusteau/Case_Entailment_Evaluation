Mr. Marr was in possession of the apprenticeship letter when he submitted the application and he thought, erroneously as it turns out, that he had provided it with the application. Can the officer be faulted for not seeking it out? I agree with the observations of Justice Rothstein, as he then was, in
Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] FCJ No 1239 (TD), at para. 4, that the burden rests on an applicant and that there is no requirement that the officer ferret out information that is not unambiguously provided in the application:
A visa officer may inquire further if he or she considers a further enquiry is warranted. Obviously, a visa officer cannot be wilfully blind in assessing an application and must act in good faith. However, there is no general obligation on a visa officer to make further inquiries when an application is ambiguous. The onus is on an applicant to file a clear application together with such supporting documentation as he or she considers advisable. The onus does not shift to the visa officer and there is no entitlement to a personal interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included.
