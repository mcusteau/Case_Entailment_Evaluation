Both ss. 78(2)(b) and (c) speak to an applicant with a one-year post-secondary educational credential other than a university educational credential; the difference between these provisions is the years of study. Subsection (b) speaks of 12 years study while (c) requires 13 years of study. What of the applicant who has the educational credential but only 11 years of study? What of the clever Scottish lad who is advanced a year at school and obtains his secondary educational credential in 10 years and then goes on to complete a one-year post-secondary credential?
