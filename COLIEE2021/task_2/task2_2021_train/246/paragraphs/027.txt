Mr. Marr submits that the interpretation proffered by the respondent would only make sense if the wording in s. 78(4) were to refer to the number of years in the "preceding" paragraph, which it does not. He points out that the Manual referred to by the respondent is neither law nor regulation and thus the Court is not bound by it.
