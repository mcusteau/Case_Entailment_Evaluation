Subsection 78(2) provides points for an applicant's education. With only one exception (s. 78(2)(a), which provides five points for a secondary school credential), the points are granted when an applicant has a combination of an educational credential (which is defined in s. 73 to mean a "diploma, degree or trade or apprenticeship credential") and a specified number of years of "competed full-time or full-time equivalent studies."

and
a specified number of years of education was to promote consistent standards in the assessment of a candidate's education and training, given the range of education and formal training systems around the world. [emphasis in original]
