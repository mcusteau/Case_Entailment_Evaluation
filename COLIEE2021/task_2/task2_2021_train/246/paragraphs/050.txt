The respondent submits that the onus was on Mr. Marr to provide all relevant documentation in support of his application for permanent residence:
Tran v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2006 FC 1377, at para. 4. The respondent notes that Mr. Marr was sent a letter requesting supporting documentation, and that given the onus to adduce sufficient documentation it is not open to him to now argue the officer erred in assessing the application.
