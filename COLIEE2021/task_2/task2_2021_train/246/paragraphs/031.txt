The paragraphs of subsection 78(2) provide for greater points to be awarded for higher educational credentials. Accordingly, when an applicant has more than one educational credential, s. 78(3) requires that the points awarded to that applicant be based on his or her highest educational credential. In the case before the Court, Mr. Marr has a two-year post-secondary credential and accordingly the points to be awarded him were to be based on that credential. That educational credential is referenced in s. 78(2)(d)(i), which reads as follows:
20 points for
. . . . .
(i) a two-year post-secondary educational credential, other than a university educational credential, and a total of at least 14 years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies,
