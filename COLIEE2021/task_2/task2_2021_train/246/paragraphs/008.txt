These simple facts give rise to at least four issues:
a. Having found that the applicant had less than the minimum number of points, did the officer err in failing to exercise his or her discretion to engage in a substituted evaluation as provided for in s. 76(3) of the
Regulations
?
b. Did the officer err in failing to find as a fact, on the basis of the material before him or her in the application, that the applicant had met the requirements of s. 78(2)(d)(i) because in addition to 13 years of education, he also had three years of apprenticeship?
c. If the apprenticeship period is not included, did the officer err in determining that under s. 78(c)(i) the applicant was to be awarded 15 points or, pursuant to s. 78(4), ought the applicant have been awarded 20 points?
d. Did the officer err in refusing to reconsider the application upon receipt of the apprenticeship letter?
