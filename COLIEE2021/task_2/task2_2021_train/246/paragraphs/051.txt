The respondent also submits that events that post-date the decision under review cannot be considered in this application for judicial review:
Bodine v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2008 FC 848, at para. 12;
George v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2007 FC 1315, at para. 12. It is submitted that the application for leave challenged the June 3, 2010 decision refusing the application and that submissions regarding the reconsideration request should not be considered in this application. According to the respondent, the reconsideration request should be the subject of a separate application for judicial review. In support of this position the respondent relies on the statement of Justice Mainville, as he then was, at para. 32 of
Medina v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2010 FC 504:
I agree with the Minister that a decision refusing to reopen an H&C application is a distinct decision from the actual decision on the H&C application decision, and may thus be challenged as a distinct decision in a judicial review proceeding. Here the Applicant only sought leave pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Act with respect to the May 11, 2009 decision, and leave was granted solely in regard to that decision. Consequently, I am not called upon to undertake any judicial review of the subsequent refusal to reopen the matter.
