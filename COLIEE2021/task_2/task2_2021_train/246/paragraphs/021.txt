[21]
It is submitted on behalf of Mr. Marr that given that the officer recognized that (1) in Scotland secondary education is completed in 11 years rather than 12 and (2) the applicant held a two-year post-secondary credential, the officer ought to have applied s. 78(4) of the
Regulations
. Mr. Marr submits that s. 78(4) of the
Regulations
applies where an applicant has a two-year post-secondary credential but less than 14 years of education, and it provides that where special circumstances exist he or she will be credited with the same number of points as the number of years of completed or full-time equivalent studies as set out in the subparagraph.
