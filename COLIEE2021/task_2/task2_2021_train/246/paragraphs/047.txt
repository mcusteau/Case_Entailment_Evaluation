[47]
In spite of my concern that the express wording of s. 78(4) does not appear to provide a visa officer with discretion, having eliminated all of the alternative interpretations, the only interpretation that remains is that the heading of s. 78(4) - "Special Circumstances" - means that where an officer determines that special circumstances exist, the officer shall award the number of points related to the educational credential despite the applicant not having achieved the requisite years of full-time study. While it is only in rare cases that courts will rectify the omission of legislative drafters, here it is necessary given that it is the only plausible interpretation of the
Regulations
. The reference to "Special Circumstances" in the heading, although not officially forming a part of the regulation, is the only tool available to render s. 78(4) comprehensible. The Supreme Court has affirmed that "... headings and preambles may be used as intrinsic aids in interpreting ambiguous statutes":
R v. Lohnes
, [1992] 1 SCR 167. Here, s. 78(4) should be read as a potential exception to the years of study requirement in s. 78(2) where, on a discretionary basis, an officer determines that special circumstances exist.
