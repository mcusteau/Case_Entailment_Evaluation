The distinction between the two manners of proceeding would be felt in the following manner: Pharmascience represented at the hearing that the evidence it currently contemplates bringing on the invalidity issues and the infringement issues
together
could likely be adduced by no more than five experts. On the other hand, the Applicant, having had the experience of litigating this particular patent as against Novopharm, and even considering the recent case law limiting the number of experts to five per side without leave of the Court, indicates that it is more likely than not that it will require more than five experts, in order to put its best foot forward on all thirteen grounds of invalidity raised in the notice of allegation. The Applicant accepted however, that if Pharmascience were to file its evidence first and limits itself to five experts, it would not only be far more difficult for it to justify being granted leave to adduce more than five experts, but that it might not be necessary at all, as this would necessarily imply a narrowing of the issues.
