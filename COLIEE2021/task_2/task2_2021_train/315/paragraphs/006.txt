The case before me, I think, is different. In those earlier cases, the applicants were seeking the reversal essentially on arguments of what the
Regulations
contemplated, and on grounds of procedural fairness and prejudice. The just, least expensive and most efficient manner of proceeding with these complex litigations was not addressed in these matters. Case management, and the power of the case management Judge to give directions that are necessary for the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of the proceedings on its merits do not appear to have been considered in these cases (indeed, in the case of
Merck
, case management was not even in existence). Further, it is fair to say that proceedings under the
Regulations
had not, at that time, reached the same proportions as they have now reached. Also, the very idea of getting the parties to consider whether an inversion of the order in which some or all of the evidence is to be adduced has recently been raised by the Court in informal discussions between members of the Court and members of that particular Bar, as a possible way of rationalizing these proceedings.
