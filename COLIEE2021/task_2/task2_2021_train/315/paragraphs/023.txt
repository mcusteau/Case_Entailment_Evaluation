I will note, however, that Pharmascience's position and argument speak of it being more concerned with preserving the tactical advantage it enjoys from filing its evidence in response to the Applicant's than to narrowing the issues in dispute at an early stage, so as to reduce the number of experts, the expenses thereof, and likely reduce the time required to bring this application to a hearing. It is, I think, a choice that Pharmascience has a right to make, but at the same time, the consequences of that choice should not be visited solely on the Applicant and on the Court. The
Regulations
impose a very short timeframe for the determination of these applications, and in attempting to shoehorn into that timeframe proceedings which are developing the complexity of full-blown patent impeachment actions, the Court is too often required to schedule, hear and determine complex motions under unreasonable pressure of time, to say nothing of the hearing on the merits. When matters are delayed, it is the Applicant who must justify an extension of the period of statutory stay, or lose its opportunity that a prohibition order might issue. The Applicant further faces the threat of section 8 damages for a longer period of time if its application is ultimately dismissed. If and when these issues should come up for determination in relation to these proceedings, I would think it appropriate that the Court review the manner in which this application in fact proceeded, and consider what impact Pharmascience's choice might have had.
