Unfortunately, Pharmascience forcefully objects to the idea that there should be a reversal of the order in which evidence is to be filed unless the Applicant provides the following counterparts: 1) That Pharmascience be allowed, as of a right, to file reply evidence; and 2) That the Applicant abandon and undertake not to rely on arguments raised in its notice of application as to the insufficiency of the notice of allegation. The Applicant will not make these concessions and I do not think its position is unreasonable. It must therefore be taken that Pharmascience objects to the Applicant's proposed order of proceeding. Pharmascience's objection - and the nature of the concessions it seeks - are such that in the circumstances, imposing a reversal of the order of evidence for part or all of the evidence would not foster that climate of cooperation necessary to realize the full benefit of efficiencies of time. Such savings of time and expense that would then result from reversing the order of evidence would likely be less considerable, and militates against imposing it on Pharmascience.
