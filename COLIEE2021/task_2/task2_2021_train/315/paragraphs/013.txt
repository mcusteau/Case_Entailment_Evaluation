It is with respect to the invalidity issues that I can conceive of the most potential for narrowing the issues and gaining efficiencies in time and expenses. The Applicant conceded that with respect to allegations of lack of sound prediction and over-broadness, it would likely have to file factual evidence from the inventors before Pharmascience could be required to file its evidence. The Applicant asserts it would be able to do that within 30 days. The Applicant then believes that Pharmascience would reasonably require 90 days (including the initial 30 days), to serve and file its evidence on invalidity. As that would considerably narrow the issues, the Applicant believes that no more than 60 days, and conceivably less might be needed for it to file its evidence. The total time to file the parties' respective evidence would therefore be 150 days. That would not, in fact, be any different than if the Applicant filed its evidence first, in the usual manner. (The Applicant would require 90 days to file its evidence first and Pharmascience accepted that, subject to its review of the Applicant's evidence, it did not foresee that more than 60 days would be needed for it to file its evidence in response.).
