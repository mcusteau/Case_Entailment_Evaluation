Quite apart from the problems with respect to the Board’s assessment of Mr. Lozano’s credibility which have already been discussed in detail, this statement is simply wrong in fact. While the quality of the photocopy of the hospital note is very poor, what is perfectly clear in the copy is the date on the note, which is 27/05/98. As a consequence, the note fits with the time frame in which Mr. Lozano says that he was beaten by the Peruvian authorities. As a consequence, I am satisfied that the rationale given by the Board for declining to attribute any weight to the document was patently unreasonable.
