Mr. Lozano’s refugee hearing commenced on September 27, 2005. It is clear from both a review of the transcript and the Board member’s decision that it was a very difficult day for all concerned. The transcript reveals that Mr. Lozano was frequently confused and seemingly had difficulties in concentrating on the task at hand. Moreover, his thoughts seemed disorganized, and his evidence was frequently inconsistent and contradictory.
