There are several problems with this submission. First of all, it is well established that in making plausibility findings, the Board must proceed with caution, and that such findings should only be made in the clearest of cases, where, for example the facts are either so far outside the realm of what could reasonably be expected that the trier of fact could reasonably find that it could not possibly have happened, or where the documentary evidence before the tribunal demonstrates that the events could not have happened in the manner asserted by the claimant: see Divsalar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 875, 2003 FCT 653, at Â¶ 24. That is simply not the case here.
