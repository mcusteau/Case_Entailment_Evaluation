  This Court has, however, clarified that citizenship appeals are no longer trials  
 de novo 
 . They proceed by way of application under Rule 300(c) of the  
 Federal Courts Rules 
 , SOR/98-106 based on the record before the Citizenship Judge (see for example  
 Lama v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 461, [2005] FCJ no 577 at para 21).
