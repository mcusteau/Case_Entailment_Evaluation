  This Court has interpreted the term "residence" in different ways. In  
 Re Pourghasemi 
  (1993), 62 FTR 122, 19 Imm LR (2d) 259, Justice Francis Muldoon favoured a strict physical presence test while Justice Barbara Reed described residence as being where an applicant "regularly, normally or customarily lives" and enumerated a series of six relevant qualitative factors in  
 Koo 
 , above. It is open to a Citizenship Judge to adopt either test (see  
 Lam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1999), 164 FTR 177, 87 ACWS (3d) 432).
