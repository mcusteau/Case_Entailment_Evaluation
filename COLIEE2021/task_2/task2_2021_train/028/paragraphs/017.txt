 [17] 
  Although there has been some recent debate as to whether one test is more appropriate (contrast the approach of Justice Robert Barnes in  
 El Ocla v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 533, [2011] FCJ no 667 with the emphasis placed on physical presence by Justice Donald Rennie in  
 Martinez-Caro v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 640, [2011] FCJ no 881), the issue is not pertinent to this appeal. The Applicant was given the benefit of the qualitative  
 Koo 
  test but was still found not to have met the residency requirement. This Court must consider whether the Citizenship Judge was reasonable in its application of the test to the evidence presented by the Applicant in this case.
