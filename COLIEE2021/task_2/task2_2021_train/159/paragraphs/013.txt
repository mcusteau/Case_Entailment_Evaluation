  The Defendant having been unsuccessful on this motion, the general rule would dictate that costs be awarded in favour of the Plaintiff. The Defendant, however, argues that costs should be awarded in its favour as a way of recognizing and sanctioning what the Defendant sees as the Plaintiff's misconduct in requesting and obtaining a warrant of arrest in the face of a caveat warrant. The Defendant's argument also relies on the provisions of Rule 494(1), which reads as follows: 
 
 
 
 "494. (1) A person at whose instance a warrant is issued for the arrest of property in respect of which there is a caveat warrant outstanding is liable to payment of all resulting costs and damages, unless the person can satisfy the Court that the person should not be liable therefor." 
 
 
 
 « 494. (1) La personne qui fait délivrer un mandat pour une saisie de biens à laquelle il est fait opposition par caveat-mandat est condamnée à tous les dépens et dommages-intérêts en résultant, à moins qu'elle ne convainque la Cour qu'elle ne devrait pas l'être. »
