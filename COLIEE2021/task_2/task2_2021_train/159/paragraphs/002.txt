  The Defendant's original motion had also requested, as its principal relief, an order quashing the warrants of arrests issued against the in rem Defendants. However, well before the hearing of this motion, the Defendant served and filed an amended notice of motion and motion record, by which it formally discontinued and abandoned that part of the motion. As a result, no cross-examinations were conducted on those parts of the parties' respective affidavits relevant to the existence of a lien or right in rem against the Defendant vessels. Notwithstanding this, the Plaintiff included in its responding record argument going to these issues, to which the Defendant raised an objection in advance of the hearing. Still, in view of the fact that the Plaintiff had made written argument on the existence of a lien or right in rem, the Defendant's counsel at the hearing attempted to resurrect that part of the motion. Despite the fact that both parties had prepared and would have been ready to make argument on the legal aspect of these issues, I was of the view that the factual record was incomplete and clearly insufficient to support a determination of these issues and dismissed the Defendants' informal verbal motion to re-amend its notice of motion.
