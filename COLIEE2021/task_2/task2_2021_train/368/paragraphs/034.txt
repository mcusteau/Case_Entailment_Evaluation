In my view, the same reasoning applies in this case. In his January 25, 1996, and August 9, 1996, letters to the High Commission, the applicant's immigration consultant clearly proposed certain SVP points for "assistant manager, retail," CCDO designation 5130-198. Obviously, he had access to the information the applicant needed for his application. The consultant's estimate of points to be assigned did not match the figure determined by the visa officer, but that is not a basis for arguing a violation of procedural fairness.
