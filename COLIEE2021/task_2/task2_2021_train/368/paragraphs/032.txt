The applicant submits that he should have been appraised of the units of assessment assigned for the SVP of his intended occupation, before being refused. The applicant would then have had an opportunity to change his intended occupation if it appeared that he would not be successful in regard to his original choice. It is also submitted that the officer violated procedural fairness by failing to inform the applicant of her concerns with respect to personal suitability and by failing to allow the applicant to respond to these. Finally, the officer's reliance on CAIPS to determine the SVP points is said to constitute improper delegation of authority. In these respects it is urged that the applicant was denied procedural fairness.
