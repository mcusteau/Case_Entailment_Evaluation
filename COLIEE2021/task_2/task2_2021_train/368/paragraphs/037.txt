I believe this reasoning applies equally to the applicant's submissions regarding failure to pinpoint shortcomings related to personal suitability. In the present case, the visa officer did advise the applicant at the conclusion of the interview that he had failed to meet the criteria for residence but did not inform him then of her specific concerns. In that respect, therefore, this case can be distinguished from
Tam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [see footnote 16] the case cited by the applicant in support of his submission, for in that case there was no forewarning by the visa officer of his negative decision before it was rendered. The visa officer's particular reservations about personal suitability of the applicant do not have to be communicated in advance of the final determination. That is a matter for decision based on the applicant's submissions and interview, subject to being set aside on judicial review only where the officer's discretion is found to have been exercised unreasonably. That is not the case here.
