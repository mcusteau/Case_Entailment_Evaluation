The visa officer interviewed the applicant on July 31, 1996. According to the applicant's affidavit, the visa officer asked the applicant what discussions he had had with his brother-in-law regarding the job offer. The applicant indicates that he initially misunderstood this question and said that there had been no discussion. He later corrected himself when the officer pointed out that a job offer letter, dated October 25, 1995, referred to previous discussions between the applicant and his brother-in-law. These discussions, the applicant avers, focused on salary and accommodation and the location of his assistant management position. The applicant also says his nervousness prompted him to wrongly indicate that the store sold furniture when asked what sort of business the store did.
