The applicant submits that the officer failed to take into account evidence relevant to the consideration of personal suitability in making her decision, in particular the applicant's employer's assessment and his volunteer activities. The visa officer has discretion in weighing evidence related to personal suitability. I agree with the position taken by my colleague Madame Justice Simpson in
Khan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
: [see footnote 9]
"... unless I can find that the Officer exercised her discretion inappropriately by overlooking relevant factors or by placing undue emphasis on particular factors or in some way acting unfairly, I am not in a position to second-guess her exercise of discretion."
In that case, the applicant argued that the officer had overlooked supportive character references in arriving at her determination of personal suitability. Simpson, J., responded to this submission as follows:
"I have concluded that there is no reason to suppose that the Officer overlooked the references. I think that the Officer concluded that the fact that the applicant was a hard worker was not overcome by the fact that he did not advance in his chosen field, either by study or by employment. It was open to the Officer to find that these were the most significant factors in her assessment of the applicant's personal suitability."
