Ports Canada answered the Commission's June 10, 1996 letter through its solicitors. On July 19, 1996, Ports Canada's solicitors forwarded responses to the information sought by the CHRC. Ports Canada's solicitors outlined their fundamental position:
"Our client's position with regard to the allegations in the Complaint is that the termination of Mr. Brine was related solely to his misconduct. Given Mr. Brine's position of extreme trust, the misconduct that took place could not be tolerated. The decision to terminate the employment of Mr. Brine was not based in any way on the 'nervous breakdown' as alleged by the Complainant.
"Mr. Brine and his legal counsel were advised about the serious allegations of misconduct and
Mr. Brine entered into a comprehensive settlement agreement with his employer
.
"Mr. Brine was not treated differently from other employees who were away from work for stress-related ailments in terms of consideration of their illness. However, his serious misconduct did result in treatment of his employment status that would be different than the treatment of employees who did not engage in serious misconduct." (emphasis mine)
