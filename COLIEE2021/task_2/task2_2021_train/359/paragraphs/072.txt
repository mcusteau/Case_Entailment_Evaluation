In addition, in my view, the Commission's legal premise in deciding this case was also faulty. The Commission appeared to be of the view that the simple existence of a release which stated the complainant was satisfied the employer had met all of its
Canadian Human Rights Act
obligations was, in of itself, sufficient to refuse to deal with a complaint. In my opinion, this is not correct in law. In
Brennan v. Canada and Robichaud
(1987), 75 N.R. 303; 40 D.L.R.(4th) 577 (S.C.C.), the court considered issues springing from the complaint under the
Act
by an employee against her employer, the Department of National Defence, and her supervisor on the grounds that she had been sexually assaulted by her supervisor. Before the Supreme Court of Canada heard argument, a settlement agreement had been entered into between the parties. The existence of this settlement agreement was made known to the court. La Forest, J., on behalf of the court, at page 586 of the reported case said:
"Finally, we were advised that a settlement has been reached with Mrs. Robichaud,
but this may not provide a full corrective to the problem identified
." (emphasis mine)
