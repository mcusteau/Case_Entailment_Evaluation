In my view, the reasons for judgment of La Forest, J., in
Cooper
(supra), establish the following propositions as to the Commission's role and functions:
(1) It is an administrative and screening body with no appreciable adjudicative role (page 893);
(2) It is the statutory body entrusted with accepting, managing and processing complaints of discriminatory practices (page 889);
(3) When deciding whether a complaint should proceed to be inquired into by a Human Rights Tribunal, the Commission fulfills a screening function somewhat analogous to that of a judge at a preliminary inquiry. It is not the job of the Commission to decide if the complaint is made out. Rather, its duty is to decide if, under the provisions of the
Act
, an inquiry is warranted having regard to all of the facts. The central component of the Commission's role, then, is that of assessing the sufficiency of the evidence before it (page 891); and
(4) The Commission has the power to interpret and apply its enabling statute but does not have a jurisdiction to address general questions of law (page 891);
