Mr. Raymond summarizes some facts and makes a recommendation. Under recommendations, Mr. Raymond wrote:
"2. Upon notification of the complaint, the respondent [Ports Canada] provided a defence,
which included a copy of the Release Agreement signed by the complainant and his legal representative on 18 April 1995. A copy of the release is attached as Appendix A
. The complainant continued to receive regular salary from March, 1995 through July, 1995 and then was eligible for a severance package of 11 eleven months gross salary.
"3.
The Release which the complainant signed on advice by his legal representative states that the complainant is satisfied that the respondent has satisfied all of its obligations under the
Canada Labour Code
and the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. The complainant states that he was not psychologically capable of making a decision concerning the Release, and the legal advice he received did not address the Human Rights or Labour Canada issues. In August, 1996 the complainant's physician confirmed the complainant was under extreme stress in April 1995 and was not in a position to negotiate the settlement
. The complainant believes the complaint should be dealt with as it deals with issues concerning disability and the refusal of continued employment.
"4.
The complainant lodged a Labour Canada unjust dismissal complaint on 17 October 1995
, to which the respondent took objection citing the Release as binding and precluded the complainant from further actions.
Noting the complainant's argument that he was not in a position to make appropriate decisions, according to the medical evidence, the adjudicator ruled on 02 June 1997 that the agreement was binding on both parties.
"5. It is recommended that the Commission not deal with the complaint, because of an
agreement
signed between the parties." (emphasis mine)
