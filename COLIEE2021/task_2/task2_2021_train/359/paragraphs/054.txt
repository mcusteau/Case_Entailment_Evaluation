Quoting the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
Williams v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1997), 212 N.R. 63 (F.C.A.), Rothstein, J., in
Canada Post
(supra), focussing on the words "it appears to the Commission", said this at page 244:
"I think the same approach is called for with respect to s. 41 of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
. The decision is one for the Commission and the determination is set forth in subjective and not objective terms. Thus the scope for judicial review of such a decision is narrow. Only considerations such as bad faith by the Commission, error of law or acting on the basis of irrelevant considerations are applicable."
