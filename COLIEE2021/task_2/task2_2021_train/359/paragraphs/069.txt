[69]
When deciding not to deal with a complaint pursuant to s. 41(1)(d) on grounds that the complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in bad faith, in my view, the footing of the Commission must be legally and factually very solid and its reasons must be consistent with the purpose of the
Act
and its role as a screening body.
