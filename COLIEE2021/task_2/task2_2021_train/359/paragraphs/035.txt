[35]
Counsel for Mr. Brine made argument to the Adjudicator that the settlement and release were invalid and ineffectual for two reasons. First, counsel argued there had been no meeting of the minds between the parties on two points:
(a) on how Mr. Brine's termination should be characterized (Mr. Brine was vehemently opposed to any notion he was dismissed for cause); and
(b) on the contents of a proposed letter of reference.
If valid, counsel for Mr. Brine said that Ports Canada had breached the agreement and release in such a manner as to constitute repudiation of both documents. Second, Mr. Brine's counsel argued the settlement agreement was unconscionable and referred to the circumstances in which Mr. Brine found himself at the time of execution. Counsel said Mr. Brine was "disabled and vulnerable".
