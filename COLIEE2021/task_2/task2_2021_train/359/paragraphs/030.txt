When the applicant received Mr. Cuthbertson's responding affidavit, he sought permission from the court to file a reply affidavit. That permission was granted by order of Muldoon, J., on May 8, 1998. In that reply affidavit, Mr. Brine said in part:
"2. The Affidavit of David Cuthbertson, filed with The Federal Court Registry in Ottawa, the 23rd day of February, 1998, contains fabricated evidence. This evidence was provided to the Canadian Human Rights Commission and may have influenced its decision to deny my application for a Tribunal review of my claim of discrimination by my previous employer, the Ports Canada Corporation.
"3. I was not informed of this evidence and had no opportunity to respond to it prior to the Commission reaching its decision. I did not know of this evidence until it was provided in the Affidavit of David Cuthbertson in response to my Originating Notice of Motion in this judicial review procedure.
"4. There are references in the letter of Mr. Alan J. Stern, to Mr. Raminder Singh of the CHRC, dated July 19, 1996, [Affidavit of Bruce Cuthbertson, Tab A] to statements, memos and letters of members of the Ports Canada Police. These referenced statements, memos and letters contain fabricated evidence."
