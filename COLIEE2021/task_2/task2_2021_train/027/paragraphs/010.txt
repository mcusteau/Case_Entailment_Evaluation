 [10] 
  The jurisdiction of a statutory body such as the Review Tribunal is limited to that set out in its enabling statute ( 
 Comeau 
 , supra). Given the ground of Ms. Heaman's appeal and the mandatory language used in section 28(2) of the  
 OASA 
 , the Review Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by hearing Ms. Heaman's appeal. There was a statutory duty, pursuant to subsection 28(2) of the  
 OASA 
 , to refer Ms. Heaman's appeal to the Tax Court of Canada for adjudication. Accordingly, the decision of the Review Tribunal should be quashed.
