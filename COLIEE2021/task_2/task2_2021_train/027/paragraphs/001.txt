 Snider, J. 
 : Since February 1998, Ms. Heaman has been eligible to receive Old Age Security Benefits under the  
 Old Age Security Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. O-9, as amended (the " 
 OASA 
 "). In the year 2000, Ms. Heaman, who retired from the federal public service in 1994, received a one-time pay equity payment. The Applicant, the Minister of Human Resources Development (the "Minister"), took the position that the pay equity monies were a retroactive salary adjustment that should be included for purposes of calculating her Guaranteed Income Supplement ("Supplement"). This reduced Ms. Heaman's Supplement by over $100 per month. Ms. Heaman was informed of this decision by letter dated December 24, 2001 in which she was advised that: "You may appeal to a Review Tribunal".
