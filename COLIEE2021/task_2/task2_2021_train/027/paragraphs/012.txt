  Although I am bound to quash the decision of the Review Tribunal because of a lack of jurisdiction, I am troubled by the Minister's failure to raise this objection before or during the hearing of the Review Tribunal. As a result, Ms. Heaman and her family - pensioners and self-represented litigants - have been put to considerable inconvenience. The matter must now be referred back to the Review Tribunal and, if pursued further by Ms. Heaman, will require representations to the Tax Court. All of this could have been avoided if the Minister had recognized the problem earlier. In the unusual circumstances of this application and exercising my discretion, I am prepared to award costs to Ms. Heaman fixed in the amount of $500.
