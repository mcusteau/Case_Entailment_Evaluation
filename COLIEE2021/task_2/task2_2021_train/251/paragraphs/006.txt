In this case, the judge ruled:
"This is not an appropriate case for the exercise of discretion under subsection 5(3) and 5(4) of the
Citizenship Act
because section 22(2)(a) specifically provides that whenever it applies "Notwithstanding anything in this Act, a person shall not be granted citizenship under section 5 ..."."
The applicant argues that the Citizenship Judge declined jurisdiction by refusing to consider whether or not to recommend an exercise of discretion under subsection 5(4) as required by subsection 15(1). He says that subsection 5(4) prevails over paragraph 22(2)(a) and that there is a discretion in the Governor-in-Council to direct the Minister to grant citizenship, "notwithstanding any other provision of this Act".
