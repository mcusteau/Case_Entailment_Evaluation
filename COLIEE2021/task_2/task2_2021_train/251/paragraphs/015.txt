[15]
Applying the implied exception technique to resolve the apparent conflict between subsection 5(4) and paragraph 22(2)(a) and considering subsection 5(4) the more general and paragraph 22(2)(a) the more specific provision, I conclude that the prohibition against the grant of citizenship to a person within three years of conviction for an offence referred to in paragraph 22(2)(a) is an implied exception to the general discretion conferred on the Governor-in-Council in subsection 5(4) to direct the Minister to grant citizenship.
