Rothstein, J.
(ex officio): When one provision of the
Citizenship Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29 as amended, provides for the granting of citizenship "notwithstanding any other provision of this
Act
" and another provision prohibits the granting of citizenship "notwithstanding anything in this
Act
", there is an apparent conflict between the provisions.
