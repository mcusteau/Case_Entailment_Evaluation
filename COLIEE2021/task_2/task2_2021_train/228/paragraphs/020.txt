From the materials before me I have concluded that an appropriate award based on Column III of Tariff B, including disbursements, if the Crown had enjoyed unmitigated success, would be in a lump sum of $95,000. That is the amount requested by the Crown. In the circumstances and because the Crown's success has now been found by the Court of Appeal to have been incomplete, I would reduce that award by one half to $47,500.
