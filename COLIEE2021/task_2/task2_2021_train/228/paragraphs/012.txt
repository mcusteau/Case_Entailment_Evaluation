It is common ground that this Court has power to order either party to a reference to pay costs. Rule 169 makes references under section 18 of the
Citizenship
Act
analagous to ordinary actions in the Court which, in turn, brings into play Rules 400 and following relating to costs awards in such actions. Each party also invokes in its favour the general rule that costs should "follow the event" i.e. that success in the proceeding will normally bring with it an order for costs. In addition Mr. Oberlander argues that the Order of the Court of Appeal should be read to include costs of the reference before Justice MacKay as well as those of the judicial review proceedings both in this Court and in the Court of Appeal.
