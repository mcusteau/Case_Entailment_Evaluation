Hugessen, J.
: These reasons deal with motions for orders fixing costs brought by both parties in two distinct but closely related proceedings in this Court. The first of those proceedings was a reference made under section 18 of the
Citizenship
Act
. Following the decision of Justice MacKay on that reference both parties made applications to him for costs orders which were by consent adjourned sine die pending the completion of revocation proceedings before the Governor in Council and the judicial review thereof. Justice MacKay having now retired, and no costs order having been made by him, each party now seeks an Order for its costs of the reference from me.
