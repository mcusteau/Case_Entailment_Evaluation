Since success has been divided, I would make no order for the costs of these motions. Also, although technically the parties in the two sets of proceedings are different, as reflected in the differing styles of cause, I consider that in each case the party truly adverse in interest to Mr. Oberlander is the Government of Canada so that there is no impediment to compensation or set-off being effected between the two awards.
