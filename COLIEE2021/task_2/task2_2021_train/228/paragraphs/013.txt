Dealing first with the last point: it is my view that the mention of "here and below" in the Order of the Court of Appeal is necessarily restricted to the judicial review application in both courts. The Court of Appeal was not in any sense sitting in review or appeal of Justice MacKay's decision and, in fact, was careful in the passages cited above to emphasize the final and determining character of his findings. Counsel argues that if Justice MacKay had actually done as he was asked to do and made a costs Order in favour of the government that Order would necessarily have had to be set aside along with the Order of the Court of Appeal setting aside the Governor in Council's order revoking citizenship. I am not at all sure of the correctness of that assertion. A costs Order is normally viewed as a mere incident or corollary of the judgment to which it relates and the final nature of the latter should, I would think, carry over to the former as well.
