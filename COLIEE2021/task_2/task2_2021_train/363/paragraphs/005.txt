Under factor 9, "personal suitability", the visa officer assessed only 2 units out of a maximum of 10. In his affidavit, he gave his reasons for that assessment. These reasons are as follows:
"16.
Factor 9 - Personal Suitability.
The Applicant's statement that he wished to immigrate to Canada in order to facilitate periodic travel back to Pakistan indicated to me that Canada was his second choice of permanent residence, and that the Applicant's motivation for immigrating to Canada was a weak one. The Applicant's statements as to what he knew about Canada were insufficient for a person who had been in North America for six years and intended to immigrate to Canada. His statements indicated that he had shown a very limited amount of initiative and resourcefulness.
"17. Also, the Applicant had not taken steps to improve his financial status, to learn new skills, to make himself more marketable in a tight job market and to elevate his level of education, etc. His failure to change his status over the years indicated that he had a limited adaptability and would be at risk of being unable to successfully establish himself in Canada. Note that in assessing his adaptability, motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other qualities with regard to his occupation, education, finances and other aspects of his life, I was not reassessing factors that had already been assessed. It was his adaptability, motivation, initiative, resourcefulness and other factors that I assessed as part of the 'personal suitability' factor, as required by Schedule I.
"18. I therefore found that a 'personal suitability' rating of two units out of 10 was warranted."
