Reed, J.
: The plaintiff seeks a declaration pursuant to s. 62(1) of the Patent Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. P-4, that the defendant's patent No. 1,003,331 (a reissue of patent No. 887,036) is invalid. Application for the patent was filed July 31, 1968, but a priority date of October 20, 1967, is claimed, based on an earlier U.S. application.
[2]
The patent relates to a therapeutic composition for the treatment of sulphamethoxazole-resistant bacterial infections. The composition, an antibiotic, is described as comprising from about one to about thirty parts of a sulphonamide and one part of a pyrimidine. The sulphonamide is described as belonging to the group consisting of 5-methyl-3 sulfanilamidoisoxazole and salts thereof (with pharmaceutically accepted bases). The pyrimidine is described as belonging to the group consisting of 2,4-diamino-5-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine and salts thereof (with pharmaceutically accepted acids). The two compounds are more simply described, in the evidence, as sulphamethoxazole (SMX) and trimethoprim (TMP) respectively.
[3]
The combination of the two drugs, as well as being described as trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), is variously called Bactrim (the defendant's product), Apo-Sulfatrim (the plaintiff's product), Septrin (the Burroughs Wellcome product) and, sometimes, simply co-trimoxazole.
Synergistic Operation of TMP/SMX
[4]
The combination of trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole operates synergistically. That is, the effect which the two have when acting together is greater than the sum of their individual effects. This can be graphically depicted by what is called an isobologram. That contained in the defendant's product monograph is set out below:
[Graph omitted. See original source.]
The curved solid line indicates the measure of synergy. If the combined effect of the drugs was additive only the graph would show a solid line from corner to corner where the hatched line appears. If the drugs were less effective when used together than when used separately (i.e.: antagonistic) a curved solid line would appear in the top right part of the graph.
[5]
I note that the synergy which occurs when trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole are used together is not caused by an interaction between the two drugs. The two drugs may be given as two separate tablets or as one. And, whether given as one or several tablets, one or several capsules, or one or several injections the two drugs remain chemically separate. The synergistic effect occurs because the two drugs interfere, independently, with two different stages of the process of synthesis of nucleic acid, a substance essential for the growth of bacteria, indeed, an essential component of all living organisms.
[6]
If one can inhibit the process of synthesizing the nucleic acid, necessary for the growth of the bacteria, one can stop the growth of that bacteria (a bacterial static effect) or perhaps even kill the bacteria (a bactericidal effect). It is sufficient for these reasons to note that the part of the process of synthesis interfered with by TMP/SMX involves para amino benzoic acid combining with pteroyl and glutamic acid to make dihydrofolic acid (stage one) and the subsequent reduction of dihydrofolic acid by an enzyme into tetrahydrofolic acid (stage two). The sulphonamides interfere with the synthesizing process at stage one. Trimethoprim interferes with the process at stage two [see footnote 1]. The synergistic effect of the sequential operation of the two drugs has been compared to the increased difficulty two hurdles placed close together pose for a runner over that of two hurdles more distantly spaced.
Basis of the Claim
[7]
It is common ground that neither sulphamethoxazole nor trimethoprim are claimed by the patent as new substances. Sulphamethoxazole and the process for making it were disclosed and claimed in U.S. patent No. 2,888,455, dated May 26, 1959. That patent claimed a priority date of September 4, 1956 based on an application having been filed as of that date in Japan. This patent was held by a Japanese pharmaceutical company Shionogi & Co. Ltd. as assignee. The defendant Hoffmann-La Roche subsequently became a licensee with respect to the drug sulphamethoxazole covered by that patent.
[8]
Trimethoprim as well as the process for making it were disclosed and claimed in U.S. patent No. 2,909,522, dated October 20, 1959. That patent claimed a priority date of February 21, 1957. This was based on an application having been filed as of that date in the United Kingdom. This patent was held by Burroughs Wellcome & Co. (U.S.A.) Inc. as assignees. The inventors were Dr. Hitchings and Dr. Roth. The patent covers certain compounds related to trimethoprim as well as trimethoprim itself. It will hereafter be referred to, for the purpose of these reasons, as the trimethoprim patent.
[9]
As noted above, what is sought to be patented in Canadian patent No. 1,003,331 is the combination of the two drugs, sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim as a therapeutic composition, in the range of ratios indicated. What is claimed to be new is the choice of sulphamethoxazole as distinct from any other sulphonamide as the one to be used in combination with trimethoprim and the fact that in combination the drugs are effective to treat bacterial infections which are resistant to treatment by sulphmethoxazole alone.
[10]
The plaintiff seeks a declaration that the patent is invalid because:
(1) the person alleged to be the inventor, Dr. Grunber, was not really the inventor;
(2) if there was something new done by Dr. Grunberg it was not an invention because it was either obvious or anticipated;
(3) the specifications and claims in the patent do not satisfy ss. 36(1) and (2) of the Patent Act;
(4) the reissue of patent No. 887,036 is invalid because the reissue is the claiming of a new and different invention from that which was claimed in the original patent;
(5) the patent is invalid because in substance it is directed to a method of treating human beings;
(6) the patent is addressed to a substance prepared or produced by a chemical process and since the method or process is neither described nor claimed in the patent, s. 41(1) of the Patent Act has not been complied with; and
(7) the alleged invention lacks utility.
[11]
Sections 36(1) and (2) provide:
"36(1) The applicant shall in the specification correctly and fully describe the invention and its operation or use as contemplated by the inventor and set forth clearly the various steps in a process, or the method of constructing, making, compounding or using a machine, manufacture or composition of matter, in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art or science to which it appertains, or with which it is most closely connected, to make, construct, compound or use it; in the case of a machine he shall explain the principle thereof and the best mode in which he has contemplated the application of that principle; in the case of a process he shall explain the necessary sequence, if any, of the various steps, so as to distinguish the invention from other inventions; he shall particularly indicate and distinctly claim the part, improvement or combination which he claims as his invention.
"(2) The specification shall end with a claim or claims stating distinctly and in explicit terms the things or combinations that the applicant regards as new and in which he claims an exclusive property or privilege."
[12]
Subsection 41(1) provides:
"41(1) In the case of inventions relating to substances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine, the specification shall not include claims for the substance itself, except when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed or by their obvious chemical equivalents."
Dr. Hitchings, Dr. Bushby and Trimethoprim
[13]
In 1942 Dr. Hitchings joined the pharmaceutical company Burroughs Wellcome Co. Inc. and commenced a study of nucleic acid metabolism for the purpose of trying to discover chemotherapeutic compounds. His work related specifically to the chemical relatives of the natural purine and pyrimidine bases of nucleic acid. I quote from Dr. Hitchings' affidavit [see footnote 2]:
"6. ... It was ... evident to me by the time our studies were initiated that there must be an intimate relationship between folic acid and purine and thymine metabolism. In order to implement the study we simultaneously established a programme of chemical synthesis and a reference biological system. We chose Lactobacillus casei as a biological system ... I proposed a programme of systematic study of the relationship between chemical structure and biological activity in order to determine the biochemical significance of each chemical feature ..."
[14]
Dr. Hitchings' research program led him and his colleagues to conclude that 2,4-diaminopyrimidines as a class tended to interfere with the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, the process referred to above as stage two of the metabolic pathway in the synthesis of nucleic acids. By 1950, Dr. Hitchings and his research team had created (synthesized) a compound related to what was to become trimethoprim: pyrimethamine, a useful antimalarial pyrimidine. By 1951 they had created a compound, closely related to trimethoprim, a 2,4-diamino-5-(3,4-dimethoxy 5 - bromobenzyl) pyrimidine. The synthesizing of trimethoprim itself was not accomplished until 1955. It was particularly difficult to do and eventually only accomplished with the help of Dr. Roth who had been hired by Dr. Hitchings for this purpose. The eventual synthesizing of the compound led to the trimethoprim patent of 1957, referred to above, in which Dr. Roth and Dr. Hitchings are named as inventors.
[15]
It is clear that as early as 1950, i.e.: prior to the creation of trimethoprim, Dr. Hitchings and his team were aware that there was synergy when pyrimidines and sulphonamides were used in combination. I quote again from Dr. Hitchings' affidavit:
"12. By the early 1950's we had become aware of
synergy
between anti-folate pyrimidines and
sulphonamides
through interpretation of a few random reports in the literature but our full understanding arose from our own studies of the pertinent enzymes and metabolic pathways ..."
Also, it is clear that once trimethoprim was created they were aware that trimethoprim operated synergistically when used in combination with sulphonamides. Indeed, the trimethoprim patent carrying a priority date of 1957 reads, in part, as follows:
"
The compounds markedly potentiate the sulfonamides
as illustrated in the experiment cited above.
A number of uses for these agents
both in vitro and in vivo,
both alone and in combination with sulfonamides will be apparent to those skilled in the art
..." (underlining added)
[16]
Once a compound such as trimethoprim has been synthesized there are various tests through which it must go before it becomes accepted as a new drug for treatment of disease in humans. Research typically begins, as it did in this case, with the synthesis of the new compound (or with the isolation of that compound if the compound is one naturally occurring in nature). If this is done rationally the biochemist will likely have some idea as to the potential properties of the compound. The compound once created is then sent to a research facility for testing both in vitro (in glass) and in vivo (in life). In vitro testing is that which occurs in a test tube or more precisely in small glass saucer shaped dishes (petrie dishes). The effectiveness of the new compound against various types of bacteria is tested. If the results are promising, in vivo tests are then conducted, often using mice because the behaviour of infectious diseases in mice parallels that in humans. Lastly the drug is tested in humans, a stage referred to as clinical trials or clinical testing. This last can only be done under the direction of a physician. In general, the medical profession prefers to use known drugs which have a history and whose side effects are known, rather than new drugs. It is my understanding that new drugs, at least those of the type in issue in this case, are only likely to be chosen in life threatening situations when the infection is not responsive to known drugs.
[17]
In any event, once trimethoprim had been successfully synthesized by Drs. Hitchings and Roth it was sent in May of 1956 to Dr. Bushby at the Wellcome Research Laboratory in Beckenham, Kent, England for in vitro and in vivo testing. Dr. Bushby did toxicity studies and found the drug to be less toxic than many drugs already in use. Trimethoprim is a safe drug because much higher concentrations of it (fifty thousand times as high) would be required to block the relevant enzyme reaction in man as are required to block the reaction in a typical bacteria. By 1959 Dr. Bushby had also done in vivo studies using mice. And, small doses had been taken by human volunteers without ill effect. As of 1959, Drs. Bushby and Hitchings were recommending that trimethoprim
in combination with sulfatriad
pass into clinical testing. In October of that year the decision to do so was made. Sulfatriad is a mixture of three sulphonamides, occasionally known as triple sulpha. The three sulphonamides used were not always the same. Different clinics might use different mixtures.
[18]
Testing was not without difficulty. Initially the batches of trimethoprim were of uneven purity. The most significant difficulty however arose from a report received in September 1960 that chronic toxicity studies carried out in dogs had found severe leucopenia, that is a severe drop in the white blood cell count. But, those results could not be reproduced. By December 1961 clinical trials had commenced at Hammersmith Hospital in London and Dr. Bushby was attempting to interest other medical centres in doing likewise.
[19]
In January of 1962 the clinical trials received a severe set-back; Dr. Jawetz of the University of California Medical Centre, the most renowned clinical bacteriologist in the United States, reported leucopenia, apparently in confirmation of the earlier reports respecting the toxicity trials in dogs. He reported that the drug was not safe to investigate further. Drs. Hitchings and Bushby thereafter encountered considerable difficulty persuading physicians to engage in further clinical trials. There were additional factors which compounded their difficulty: alternative antibiotics were becoming available; sulphonamides in general were not popular at this time; combination drugs were suspect in some quarters.
[20]
Drs. Hitchings and Bushby, as a result of the extensive studies they had done, never ceased to be convinced of the low toxicity of TMP/SMX and its high degree of effectiveness. Also Dr. Bushby indicated that the circumspection with respect to use of the drug was much more evident on this side of the Atlantic than on the other (Exhibit 44, pp. 94-95, 104, 107). Nevertheless, the management of Burroughs Wellcome was no longer willing to vigorously pursue development of the drug. Dr. Hitchings pithily described management's attitude when he said they had been persuaded that "Hitchings didn't know what he's talking about".
[21]
Among those who were convinced of the drug's low toxicity and great effectiveness was a Dr. Whitman, an employee of Burroughs Wellcome and a colleague of Dr. Hitchings. The two men spoke often. In March of 1962 Dr. Whitman went to one of the Hoffmann-La Roche group of companies (Roche Nutley in New Jersey) taking a quantity of trimethoprim with him. At that time Dr. Whitman met with Dr. Grunberg and gave him samples of trimethoprim. Dr. Whitman told Dr. Grunberg about the drug and that Burroughs Wellcome did not intend to vigorously pursue its development. It is not clear whether Dr. Whitman had applied for a job with Roche Nutley at an earlier time, or whether he did so at the time of his March visit, or only at some later date. In any event Dr. Whitman was eventually hired by Roche Nutley in October of 1962. Roche Nutley was the leading supplier of sulphonamides in the United States and as noted above sulfa drugs at the time were becoming less and less popular. Thus it was clearly in the interest of Roche Nutley to investigate any mechanism or compound which might increase the effectiveness of sulphonamides.
[22]
It seems fair to conclude, also, that both Dr. Whitman and Dr. Grunberg were aware that Dr. Jawetz's reputation was undergoing some re-evaluation at that time. It was being noted that his results were not always reproducible. Indeed by May of 1962 Dr. Jawetz had admitted that he might have been wrong in his assessment of the trimethoprimsulphonamide combination and by August of 1962 he reported that the drug gave good results with no adverse effects.
Dr. Grunberg and Trimethoprim
[23]
After meeting with Dr. Whitman in March of 1962, Dr. Grunberg set about to test trimethoprim. He determined what would be an inactive dose of trimethoprim vis-à-vis various bacteria and combined this dosage with two different sulphonamides. The internal report of this testing (referred to in the evidence as the "red corner" report) prepared August 14, 1962, for Roche Nutley management, reads in part as follows:
"
In patent # 2,909,522 it was claimed by Hitchings and Roth that 2,4-Diamino-5-(3, 4, 5-trimethoxybenzyl)-
pyrimidine (Ro 5-6846),
not only has a broad range of
antibacterial efficacy in vitro but
markedly potentiates the activity of sulfonamides
in vivo. On ST sheet of 5 16 62
the antibacterial activity of [trimethoprim] Ro 5-6846 was confirmed
in that it showed an appreciable effect against the Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus vulgaris infections of mice. In addition experiments have been carried out to study the effects of [trimethoprim] Ro 5-6846 in combination with Gantrisin and Gantanol. Experiments were also carried out to study the effect of combinations of Gantrisin and Gantanol and [trimethoprim] RO 5-8646 on Gantrisin resistant strains since
information had reached us that clinically, [trimethoprim] Ro 5-6846 in combination with sulfonamides, was effective in the treatment of sulfonamide resistant bacteria.
. . . . .
"The effects of Gantrisin and the combination of the sulfonamide with [trimethoprim] Ro 5-6846 against Gantrisin resistant strains are given in Table 2.
Because of limited supplies of the pyrimidine, combinations with Gantanol could not be investigated
...
"The combination of Gantrisin or Gantanol with [trimethoprim] Ro 5-6846 when tested against Gantrisin sensitive and Gantrisin resistant strains of bacteria exhibited an effect superior to that of the sulfonamides alone." (underlining added)
[24]
Gantrisin is a sulphonamide called suphisoxazole, or sometimes sulfafurazole and it is a Roche Nutley product. Indeed Dr. Grunberg was very instrumental in its development. Gantanol is the trade name for sulphamethoxazole which as noted above was originally synthesized by Shionogi & Co. Ltd. but by this time was manufactured and marketed by (Roche Nutley) Hoffmann-La Roche under licence from Shionogi. The "red corner" report of August 1962 makes it clear that sulphamethoxazole (Gantanol) resistant strains were not tested as of that date because the supplies of trimethoprim ran out. Exactly when Dr. Grunberg had further testing done with respect to sulphamethoxazole (Gantanol) is the subject of much dispute. I will return to this aspect of the evidence later.
Hoffmann-La Roche - Burroughs Wellcome Collaboration
[25]
Dr. Grunberg's work, described in the August 1962 report, resulted in Hoffmann-La Roche becoming very interested in the possibility of marketing a trimethoprim-sulphonamide combination product. Hoffmann-La Roche is being used in these reasons to describe one or more of the group of companies which take that name. Among their number are, for example, the sister companies Roche Nutley in the United States and Roche Basle in Switzerland.
[26]
Negotiations between Hoffmann-La Roche and Burroughs Wellcome ensued. Burroughs Wellcome gave Hoffmann-La Roche an option with respect to trimethoprim in May of 1964 and this subsequently matured, in 1969, into a licence to enable that company to manufacture and market trimethoprimsulphamethoxazole. Sometime during the relevant period Burroughs obtained a licence to manufacture and market sulphamethoxazole so that it also was in a position to manufacture and market a trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination. During the 1963-1967 period representatives of the two companies met together, to decide jointly on the combination or combinations of sulphonamide and trimethoprim which would be chosen for the market. I quote from Dr. Hitchings' affidavit:
"27. ... In our previous work we had shown that sulphatriad worked reasonably well, but there now seemed to be some prejudice against this mixture of three sulphonamides partly as a result of the Jawetz work and partly because of the variability in the three constituents of the sulphatriad between clinics. In addition, Roche Nutley were concerned in the 'improvement' of their own sulphonamides, which is how they seemed to see 'potentiation', and their preferred candidate sulphonamide was stated to be one whose chemical name is variously sulfisoxazole or sulphafurazole, and Roche Nutley sold under their trademark 'Gantrisin'. This compound has a half-life of only six hours which seemed far from ideal to me."
[27]
Dr. Hitchings' affidavit continues, particularly with respect to the discussions between Burroughs Wellcome, Roche Nutley and Roche Basle (the Swiss member of the Hoffmann-La Roche group of companies):
"28. ... I had some part in these discussion [sic] on the scientific side and I recall that it was at a joint meeting in Basle in October of 1964 that ... [Burroughs Wellcome] decided that for their purposes the sulphonamide of most interest was that sold by both Roche Nutley and Roche Basle under the trademark 'Gantanol' and whose chemical name is
sulphamethoxazole
... on the basis that its half-life matching was correct and that it also had the widest therapeutic applicability of the Roche sulphonamides. I recall that our real point of decision on the scientific side came during the train journey which Dr. Bushby and I made together between Zurich and Basle to attend this meeting ...
"29. Unfortunately, neither Roche Basle nor Roche Nutley accepted this view. ... Roche Nutley looked at their available armoury of sulphonamides in which the most successful was 'Gantanol' (SMX) and decided that that product was not obviously in need of improvement. On the other hand, in the United States at least, Roche Nutley seemed to think 'Gantrisin' was a product requiring the benefits of potentiation. ... In a note which I wrote at the end of 1964 I said:
'I should be much happier with the whole situation if some straightforward trials of 'Gantanol' - Trimethoprim on a twice-daily schedule were being undertaken.'
In the event I have been proven right, but there was certainly no uniformity of expert opinion at the time and the controversy continued through the early months of 1965. For some time it appeared that Roche Nutley seriously had in mind marketing separate combinations of Trimethoprim with each of the Roche sulphonamides: 'Gantrisin', 'Gantanol' (SMX) and 'Madribon' ...
"30. ... The American and European lines of research continued to diverge, even after Roche Nutley took up their licence option in November 1965. ... When it became clear in 1967 that there would be a launch of the Trimethoprim/SMX ('Gantanol') 1: 5 combination under the trademark '
Septrin
' by the Petitioners and under the trademark 'Bactrim' by Roche Basle we hoped that Roche Nutley would make similar plans ... In mid-year I was still pressing Roche Nutley to make up their mind finally on the sulphonamide to be used and recommended yet again that it should be 'Gantanol' (SMX) as in Europe."
Roche Nutley did eventually decide to market the sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination (Bactrim). On October 20, 1967 the U.S. application for the patent in issue in this case was filed. It was, of course, not Dr. Grunberg, the person named as inventor in the patent, who decided to file such application. That decision was made by the legal department of Roche Nutley.
State of the Art - Choice of Sulphonamide
[28]
It is necessary, next, to review the general state of knowledge at the time of the alleged invention as opposed to the particular knowledge of Drs. Hitchings and Bushby. Most of the evidence in this case was directed to an August 1962 date of invention because that was the date of invention the defendant originally asserted. Thus much of the analysis that follows will tend to centre around that date even though a somewhat later date of invention is now asserted by the defendant.
[29]
The precise mechanism by which the synergistic effect of sulphonamides and trimethoprim when used in combination was accomplished, was not completely known in the early 1960's, but there is little doubt that the fact that sulphonamides as a class were potentiated by (acted synergistically with) trimethoprim was known. For knowledge of this latter one need only refer to the 1959 trimethoprim patent itself (quoted above at page 7). In addition, I note the following excerpts from published articles, all of which would have been generally available to persons knowledgeable in the field.
[30]
In 1952 Dr. Hitchings and his colleagues published an article in the Journal of Biological Chemistry, a periodical edited for the American Society of Biological Chemists, entitled Antagonists of Nucleic Acid Derivatives VII 2,4-Diaminopyrimidines. They wrote:
"The rôle of the diaminopyrimidines as chemotherapeutic agents against plasmodia and toxoplasma (31) presumably is to be attributed to their activities as antimetabolites of the folic-folinic acid series of vitamins. As evidence of their participation in this biochemical pathway there may be cited the synergism between these drugs and sulfonamides."
In 1953, Dr. Hitchings and colleagues wrote another article, in the same journal, entitled Antagonists of Nucleic Acid Derivatives VIII Synergism in Combinations of Biochemically Related Antimetabolites. In that they wrote:
"When inhibitors for each of two sequentially related metabolites are available, potentiation often is approximately 10-fold; i.e., only about one-tenth as much inhibitor, in terms of effective doses, will be required when two loci are attacked as when a single antimetabolite is used. ... the availability of sulfonamides competing in reaction (a) and of diaminopyrimidines competing in reaction (b) has prompted the trial of combinations of these drugs in a number of biological systems, and potentiation has been a regular and predictable event ..."
[31]
And in 1955 Dr. Hitchings published an article in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition entitled Purine and Pyrimidine Antagonists. He wrote:
"Combinations of sulfonamides with diaminopyrimidines provide systems in which the mechanism of action of the latter can be tested. Such combinations provide sequential blockade of a biosynthetic pathway and would be expected therefore, to produce potentiative effects. In fact, a wide variety of combinations of sulfonamides with diaminopyrimidines and condensed systems containing the diaminopyrimidine moiety, has been tested in vitro and in vivo and potentiation has been observed in every instance."
One of the drug combinations specifically studied and discussed in this article was sulfadiazine in combination with 2, 4-diamino-5-(3', 4'-dimethoxybenzyl) pyrimidine. This combination was found to act synergistically and to be effective to inhibit the growth of proteus vulgaris.
[32]
And in an article published in 1960, entitled Potentiation in Combinations of Three Biochemically Related Antimetabolites, Dr. Hitchings and some colleagues noted:
"... The potentiation that results when sulfonamides and diaminopyrimidines are used in combination is already well documented for a variety of systems both in vitro and in vivo."
and at page 562:
"The synergism between sulfonamides, which interfere with the biosynthesis of folic acid, and the small molecule antifolic acids, represented by the diaminopyrimidines, is a general phenomenon that can be observed in almost all species that synthesize folic acid de novo."
An abstract of a paper presented in August 1961 by Drs. Hitchings and Bushby (at the Moscow proceedings of the Fifth International Congress of Biochemistry) stated as follows:
"... 'Trimethoprim' (B.W. 56-72, 2, 4-diamino-5-(3', 4', 5'-trimethoxy-benzylpyrimidine) has been selected for detailed study and clinical trial. This substance has a moderately broad antibacterial spectrum ... In combination with sulfonamides a strong potentiative effect is observed as a consequence of the sequential blockade of the biochemical pathway which leads to the synthesis de novo of coenzymes F. This potentiation can be demonstrated both in vitro and in experimental infections in mice with Staphylococcus and Proteusz."
While the officially published version of this abstract did not appear until publication of the Congress Journal in 1963, the abstract was distributed to those attending the Moscow 1961 conference, in advance of that conference and certainly no later than the conference itself.
Choice of Sulphonamide - Obviousness and Anticipation
[33]
The defendant's position is that on the basis of the literature (1) it is far too broad a statement to say that it was known at the time that sulphonamides as a class potentiated pyrimidines because the literature only discloses experiments with sulphadiazine, and sulphatriad; (2) that as a practical matter there are in fact sulphonamides which trimethoprim does not potentiate; and (3) in any event among those that are potentiated there are many (some) that are unacceptable for treating humans. It is argued that there are thousands of permutations and combinations that might be chosen; that there are thousands of sulfa compounds; that there were 140 compounds on the market in the early 1960s and the selecting of the appropriate one required extensive testing, work, trial and error, etc. I cannot accept this conclusion. Applying the well known test of obviousness [see footnote 3], the combination of trimethoprim with sulphamethoxazole with an obvious step to take. Indeed, in my view Dr. Grunberg chose to test this combination mainly because sulphamethoxazole was easily available to him; it was one of the sulphonamides then being marketed by Roche Nutley and was therefore part of the stock in trade in his laboratory. I do not think either the decision to test trimethoprim with sulphamethoxazole or the results of doing so were considered as having any particular significance or importance over the results attainable from combining trimethoprim with other commonly used sulfa compounds. In addition, the evidence demonstrates that the antibacterial properties of sulphonamides are similar (infra pages 19-20). Sulphamethoxazole was on the market; its properties were known.
[34]
Indeed, it would appear that the eventual choice of sulphamethoxazole as the sulphonamide to be combined with trimethoprim, for marketing purposes, was made by either Drs. Bushby and Hitchings or personnel of Roche Basle but not by Dr. Grunberg or Roche Nutley. Sulphamethoxazole was seen merely as one of a number of sulphonamides that could be combined with trimethoprim. Roche Nutley was concerned with choosing a sulphonamide which it felt needed "potentiating"; that is, improving the potency of one of its sulphonamides (Gantrisin) which was losing market popularity. Drs. Bushby and Hitchings (as well as Roche Basle) were concerned with the pharmacological properties of the sulphonamide and particularly in matching its half life to that of trimethoprim. If the half-lives of the two drugs are the same the rate of absorption in the body of the two is the same. This makes the combining of them into one tablet easier and prescribing dosages less complicated. There is absolutely nothing in the evidence that can lead me to conclude that the testing of sulphamethoxazole with trimethoprim, which Dr. Grunberg did, was other than an entirely obvious routine, indeed, mechanical step to take.
[35]
As well as being obvious, the choice of sulphamethoxazole in combination with trimethoprim was entirely anticipated by what is referred to in the evidence as the Hoffer patent, a patent filed in May, 1966 in Belguim. Hoffer, like Dr. Grunberg, was an employee of one of the Hoffmann-La Roche groups of companies. That patent, in part, states as follows:
"The compounds of formula I [trimethoprim]
prepared by the process are useful as antibacterial agents, particularly for topical applications.
They are also useful as antibacterial agents with
antibacterial sulphonamides; for example, sulfisoxazole,
sulfamethoxazole
, sulfadimethoxine, sulfaquinoxaline, etc. For example, a typical adult dose of a combination of sulfisoxazole and a compound of Forumla I for oral administration is 0.5 g. of sulfisoxazole and a compound of Formula I for oral administration is 0.5 g. of sulfisoxazole and 100 mg. of a compound of Formula I in unit dosage form, et. tablet, capsule, aqueous suspension, troche, etc. compounded with the usual pharmaceutical excipients."

State of the Art - Sulphonamide Resistant Strains
[36]
What then of the lack of specific references in the prior art to a trimethoprim-sulphonamide, or more particularly trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, combination as effective to treat infections caused by sulphonamide, or more particularly sulphamethoxazole, resistant strains of bacteria? There is little explicit reference in the literature to the former and no reference to the latter. I am not convinced, however, that such lack of explicit reference should be taken to mean that such effectiveness was not known at the time, or an obvious conclusion to be drawn from the common knowledge which existed.
[37]
During the 1950s the appearance of bacterial strains resistant to sulfa drugs became an increasingly common phenomenon. It was found that once a given sulfa drug had been in use for some time, bacteria of a type previously sensitive to treatment by the drug became resistant to that drug. This resistance arose by way of at least three different mechanisms which I do not think it necessary to describe. Suffice it to say that in the early 1960s these mechanisms were not completely understood by the microbiologists and biochemists. What was known was that once a drug had been in use for some time, larger and larger doses of that drug were needed to cure the same infection. Sometimes this occurred over the course of years. At other times it might occur in the course of one infection if the bacteria became resistant to the drug quickly. Thus resistance was seen as a relative concept. A drug lost its therapeutic value when the dosage required to kill the bacteria became so large that the toxic side effects simply did not justify its use. At the extreme end of this sliding scale the drug (theoretically) would kill the patient before it killed the bacteria.
[38]
There was some attempt in the evidence to try to distinguish between "truly resistant" bacteria and those resistant for other reasons (as mutants or by way of acquired resistance). Whatever may be the intrinsic worth of that distinction (if indeed it has any at all for the purposes of this case) there is certainly no evidence which convinces me that the common understanding of the phenomenon of resistance, during the late 1950s and early 1960s, was other than that of a graduated scale. Nor is there anything in the evidence to indicate either that Dr. Grunberg relied upon or that the patent was drafted with reference to a concept of resistance limited to bacterial strains which might be said to be "truly resistant" or "innately resistant". A bacterial strain which did not respond at all to a certain drug was labelled "not responsive" to that drug rather than resistant.
[39]
The common knowledge with respect to synergy at the time included the concept that when a drug combination was used which gave this effect a cure could be effected by using much smaller doses of the two drugs than was needed to effect the same cure with, what I will call for ease of reference, normal dosages of the drugs. A corollary of the fact that lower than normal dosages could effect an expected cure was that normal dosages could effect cures not previously attainable. This being so, it would follow logically and implicitly that infections resistant to cure by normal dosages of a drug might be cured when that same dosage (or less) of that drug was used in combination with another drug with which it operated synergistically. Thus, it is not surprising that little reference is found in the literature to the effectiveness of synergistic combinations against resistant bacterial strains. The synergistic drug combination was simply thought of as being more potent, whether it be used against sensitive or against resistant bacterial strains. That such was the common understanding of those skilled in the art at the relevant time can be seen from an article written in 1967 by Csonka and Knight entitled Therapeutic Trial of Trimethoprim as a Potentiator of Sulphonamides in Gonorrhoea (British Journal of Venereal Diseases vol. 43, p. 161). Those authors start their article by summarizing some past history:
"
Trimethoprim
... Of special interest was the observation in vitro and in vivo that the compound markedly
potentiates the antibacterial activity of sulphonamides
; this effect reduces the concentration of each drug required for the systemic treatment of bacterial infections and
has made it possible to treat successfully infections due to sulphonamideresistant organisms
(Elion, Singer, and Hitchings, 1954, 1960)." (underlining added)
Csonka and Knight interpreted the 1954 and 1960 articles of Elion, Singer and Hitchings, which do not expressly refer to the treatment of sulphonamide resistant strains, as implicitly teaching that infections caused by such strains could be cured by a trimethoprim-sulphonamide combination.
[40]
One other aspect of the common knowledge should be mentioned: the antibacterial activities of sulphonamides are and were known to be similar, even though there are differences in their pharmacology (i.e.: half life, rate of absorption into and excretion from the human body, penetration into certain tissue areas). That their antibacterial activities are similar is abundantly demonstrated by the evidence of Dr. Anderson. He stated that when bacteria are tested to determine what drug should be used to cure an infection, one sulphonamide only is used for testing purposes. The results thus obtained are considered to provide reliable data with respect to all sulphonamides, i.e.: all those that are in use for therapeutic purposes (page 635-636 of the transcript [see footnote 4]). This characteristic of sulphonamides, in relation to resistance, is demonstrated by a passage in a 1963 textbook written by Barber and Garrod, entitled Antibiotic and Chemotherapy, at page 34:
"Resistance appears to be common to all sulphonamides. Thus a strain with an increased resistance to one sulphonamide shows a comparable increase in resistance to the others ..."
[41]
I am not convinced therefore, that the fact that a trimethoprim-sulphonamide combination would be effective to treat an infection resistant to treatment by sulphonamides alone was not part of the common knowledge in the late 1950's and early 1960's.
Nature of Invention
[42]
As noted above, what is claimed as the invention is the use of
sulphamethoxazole
and trimethoprim
specifically
to cure infections caused by
sulphamethoxazole resistant bacterial strains.
[43]
In March of 1962 Dr. Whitman went to see Dr. Grunberg. He told him that trimethoprim potentiated sulphonamides. He told him that the reduction in dosages were 1/4 and 1/4 or 1/2 and 1/4. He told him that
clinically
trimethoprim in combination with sulphonamides had been found
effective to treat sulphonamide resistant bacteria
.
[44]
The "red corner" report of August 1962 which summarized the initial testing done by Dr. Grunberg and his team demonstrates that no testing of sulphamethoxazole resistant strains was done as of that date. It also demonstrates that in the case of sulphafurazole (Gantrisin), testing against Gantrisin sensitive and Gantrisin resistant strains was carried out.
[45]
The defendant argues that an essential aspect of the present invention is the fact that the synergistic combination (trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole) is effective against bacterial infections resistant to treatment by one of the drugs (sulphamethoxazole), used in the synergistic combination. Yet the fact that this was demonstrated to be equally the case with respect to the testing of sulphafurazole (Gantrisin) in the August, 1962 report, passed without comment by Dr. Grunberg or others at that time.
[46]
As already noted, there are no laboratory notes or other records of a program of testing of sulphamethoxazole resistant strains. Among the few documents extant in this case are the Roche Nutley requisition sheets for March 6, 1962 and March 26, 1964. Both of these describe the testing of trimethoprim being done by Dr. Grunberg as testing for the "potentiation of antibacterial activity of sulphonamides". There is no specific focus on sulphamethoxazole resistant strains.
[47]
In 1966 Dr. Grunberg and Dr. DeLorenzo gave a paper at the sixth Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. This paper was later published in the proceedings of that society and it was entitled Potentiation of Sulfonamides and Antibiotics by Trimethoprim. It described the testing of trimethoprim with a variety of sulphonamides and other antibiotics. The test results of the August 1962 "red corner" report were included as part of that presentation. No testing of sulphamethoxazole resistant strains was referred to or reported.
[48]
In October 1967, a patent application was filed in the United States. This was followed by the corresponding Canadian application of July 31, 1968 which led to Canadian patent number 887036 issued November 30, 1971. That patent contained no specific reference to sulphamethoxazole resistant strains. It does make reference to sulphonamide resistant strains in general. It reads in part:
"... it is also known that various micro organisms, which are at first susceptible to treatment with wellknown sulfonamides, develop a resistance which ultimately results in drug fast strains.
"Accordingly, it was of particular interest to develop a combination of sulfonamide and activator [i.e.: trimethoprim] which is effective against sulfonamide resistant strains. Unexpectedly, it has now been found that the combination of this invention is medicinally effective, for example, against a sulfonamide resistant strain of proteus vulgaris."
[49]
The test results from the August 1962 "red corner" report which relate to the testing of sulphamethoxazole against sulphonamide sensitive strains are all included in the patent. These also were referred to in the paper presented by Drs. Grunberg and DeLorenzo in 1966. This testing consisted of using the trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination as against at least six different sulphamethoxazole sensitive bacterial strains (s. hemolyticus No. 4; D. pneumoniae No. 6301; S. aureus smith; E. coli No. 257; P. vulgaris No. 190; P. aeruginosa B). A record of the testing of one sulphamethoxazole resistant strain (a proteus vulgaris strain) was included as well. This test data was included in both the 1967 U.S. patent application and patent which issued as well as the corresponding Canadian patent.
[50]
In November 1973, Dr. Grunberg wrote another article describing further studies that had been done with respect to the potentiation effect of trimethoprim when used together with sulphonamides or other antibiotics. It was entitled The Effect of Trimethoprim on the Activity of Sulfonamides and Antibiotics in Experimental Infections; and was published in vol. 128, Journal of Infectious Diseases at page 5478. There is no reference to the testing of the proteus vulgaris sulphamethoxazole resistant strain, referred to in the patent, in that article. The article does make reference to the testing of sulfisoxazole (SSX) resistant strains. The only sulphamethoxazole resistant strain referred to were some serratia marcescens strains:
"Further studies have extended the observations on the potentiation of SMZ [SMX] by TMP. As is shown in table 4 TMP also potentiates the activity of SMZ [SMX] against H. influenzae, Salmonella schottmuelleri, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, a second strain of E. coli and a sulfisoxazole-resistant strain of P. vulgaris. As is shown in table 5 the combination was active against SMZ-[SMX] sensitive strains of S. marcescens as well as some, but not all, naturally resistant clinical isolates of S. marcescens [SMZ is an alternate designation for SMX]."
There was no focus on the fact that bacterial strains resistant to sulphmethoxazole alone could be treated by a trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination. This was treated as merely one aspect of the study of potentiation.
[51]
There is no documentary evidence that any extensive program of testing of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination against sulphamethoxazole resistant strains was carried out by Dr. Grunberg or Roche Nutley. If there had been such a program it seems likely that the results would have been included in the 1967 patent, as were the results with respect to the one proteus vulgaris strain. No results of any such program of testing were documented at that time and none were included in the Canadian reissue patent. Counsel for the defendant refers to references made to several sulphamethoxazole "resistant strains" in the U.S. reissue application, as support for the contention that testing of sulphamethoxazole resistant strains was done by Dr. Grunberg. These were also referred to by one of the witnesses, Dr. Cleeland. One of the five strains included in the reissue application, diplocococcus pneumoniae is not normally sulphonamide sensitive; two of them, serratia marcescens ST and SM, were identified in Dr. Grunberg's 1973 paper as sulphonamide sensitive strains; a fourth klebsiella pneumoniae A was not responsive at all to the trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination. Thus that evidence is of little use for the purpose claimed. It does no more than demonstrate that Dr. Grunberg may have incidentally tested some sulphamethoxazole resistant strains in the course of his overall work with respect to potentiation. No laboratory or other notes exist with respect to any testing of the trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination focussed on sulphamethoxazole resistant strains. It is fair to conclude therefore that no such program of testing occurred. The one or two isolated instances of the trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination being used against sulphamethoxazole resistant strains are nothing more and were considered to be nothing more than illustrations of the general phenomenon which Dr. Grunberg and his colleagues were considering: the potentiation of sulphonamides by trimethoprim.
[52]
Around 1972-1973, it came to the attention of the Roche Nutley patent attorneys that several foreign patents had issued in 1965 and 1966 which contained disclosures similar to those set out in the Hoffer patent, quoted above at pages 16-17. These disclosures taught the potentiation of sulphamethoxazole by trimethoprim. An application for reissue of the United States patent was filed in January 28, 1974. This was mirrored by an application for reissue of the Canadian patent number 887,036. In the reissue patent the description of the invention was particularized as being effective against sulphamethoxazole resistant bacterial strains, replacing the earlier description of the trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole combination as effective against sulphonamide resistant strains generally. This change led to a rather odd looking reissue patent (Canadian patent, number 1,003,331). While the description and claims are particularized with respect to sulphamethoxazole resistant bacterial strains, the supporting data contained in the patent is directed to the earlier and less specific claim, i.e. that sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim potentiates sulphonamides. Testing against only one sulphamethoxazole resistant strain is referred to: the proteus vulgaris strain mentioned earlier. The rest of the data in the patent i.e. the six other strains, are all sulphonamide (sulphamethoxazole) sensitive bacterial strains so they are completely irrelevant for the purposes of an invention claimed to relate to a therapeutic compound effective against sulphamethoxazole resistant bacteria.
[53]
I note in addition, that no reference is made in the product monographs which are issued, for the guidance of physicians, with respect to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (eg: Bactrim) to any particular effectiveness the combination might have as against sulphamethoxazole resistant strains. And, the evidence establishes that it is not the practice of physicians to use the TMP/SMX combination with any such particularity in mind. Bacteria are not tested specifically for sulphamethoxazole resistance before TMP/SMX is prescribed. That drug is used indiscriminately regardless of whether the bacteria is resistant to sulphamethoxazole, other sulphonamides or not.
[54]
I am therefore not convinced that the work Dr. Grunberg did can be characterized as an
invention
that sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim constitute a therapeutic composition for the treatment of sulphamethoxazole resistant bacterial strains. The particularity added to the patent on reissue (i.e. the limitation with respect to effectiveness against sulphamethoxazole resistant bacteria strains) is clearly a refinement added by the Roche Nutley patent lawyers for the purpose of coopering-up a patent which they suspected to be anticipated by the filing of the Hoffer patent. That particularity was not part of the original testing by Dr. Grunberg, and it is debatable that it has any value at all in the context of this case.
Date of Invention
[55]
Having decided that there was in fact no invention it seems somewhat illogical to attempt to assess the evidence relating to the date of invention. Nevertheless I shall do so. Although the patent application was filed in October 1967, the defendant claimed, at the beginning of the present litigation, an invention date of August 1962. On the eve of trial this claim was modified so that an invention date of sometime in 1962 or 1963 but at least by mid 1963 was asserted. An invention date of at least mid 1963 is claimed on the ground that Dr. Grunberg tested the sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim combination against sulphamethoxazole resistant bacterial strains at some time during that period. As noted above, the testing done by Dr. Grunberg in August 1962 and described in the "red corner" report did not include a testing of sulphamethoxazole resistant strains: the supply of trimethoprim had run out. The testing of one such resistant strain (proteus vulgaris) is mentioned in the 1967 patent application. And there is reference to some possibly resistant strains in the U.S. reissue application of 1974.
[56]
There are no extant laboratory records regarding the testing which allegedly occurred subsequent to August 1962. The evidence with respect to that testing is all oral, given by Dr. Grunberg, Dr. DeLorenzo and Dr. Cleeland. Both Dr. Grunberg and Dr. DeLorenzo gave evidence that the testing occurred in 1962-1963. Dr. Cleeland was not an employee of Roche Nutley at that time but his evidence was that he helped Dr. DeLorenzo retrieve the laboratory notebooks in 1972, at the request of the Roche Nutley patent department and Dr. Grunberg, and he remembers that those books contained tests respecting sulphamethoxazole resistant strains. The laboratory notebooks were sent to the Roche Nutley legal department in 1972 and thereafter lost. Also the master sheets concerning the relevant experiments were thrown out sometime in the 1970s because of lack of storage facilities (transcript p. 1745).
[57]
I do not accept Dr. Grunberg and Dr. DeLorenzo's recollection of the time frame involved for the testing of sulphamethoxazole resistant strains. It is now more than twenty years after those events occurred and not at all unlikely that their memories in this regard are mistaken. Dr. Grunberg has a high degree of loyalty to his company. That company gave him the opportunity to pursue his primary vocational objective: assisting in the development of therapeutic compounds for the treatment of disease in humans. As a result of that sense of loyalty I think there is a natural tendency on his part to want to be more specific with respect to time frames than actual memory warrants.
[58]
The response of Dr. DeLorenzo to a question concerning the toxicity testing of trimethoprim is worth noting:
"I would say about the same time.
I forget because we do so much work it is hard to put it into time spans."
(underlining added)
(page 1570, volume 10, of the transcript of evidence)
I think this accurately reflects the state of the memories of both men: there was so much work that it would be hard to put it into time frames. This is especially expected to be the case so many years after the event. Neither Dr. Grunberg nor Dr. DeLorenzo would have had their attention focussed on patent considerations, such as the time frame within which specific tests occurred, at the time they were doing the testing. And what is more, in this particular case the evidence seems clear that any testing of sulphamethoxazole resistant strains that occurred (the one proteus vulgaris strain and the possibly resistant strains of serratia marcescens) were done incidentally, in the course of testing focussed on other considerations: i.e. the potentiation of sulphonamides by trimethoprim not effectiveness against sulphamethoxazole resistant strains in particular.
[59]
What then of the evidence concerning the subsequent retrieval from storage in 1972, at the request of the Roche Nutley legal department, of the laboratory note books? That the books were retrieved and sent to the legal department seems clear. Most of the evidence on this point comes from Doctor Cleeland. His evidence is that he remembers seeing in those books reports on the testing of a proteus strain, several serratia strains, and a diplococcus pneumonia strain, all being resistant strains. These species apart from the proteus strain, were not included in the Canadian patent. That they were in fact resistant strains, apart from the proteus vulgaris strain, is not proved (supra page 23).
[60]
I accept that Dr. Cleeland did certain computations of at least some CD[50] values for the purpose of identifying the appropriate test results to send to the patent department. I accept that he helped retrieve the laboratory notebooks which contained the records of the testing of various strains. I am not convinced, however, that it has been proved that the testing, of either the proteus strain or the possibly resistant serratia marcescens strain, occurred prior to mid 1963. In coming to this conclusion I am particularly influenced by the fact that no laboratory records have been produced which might document such testing. No master sheets or other records, apparently, are in existence. There has been a "selective finding" of documents by the defendant: the "red corner" report was found on the eve of trial and the claimed date of invention adjusted accordingly; requisition sheets were "found" towards the end of the trial and after the plaintiff's evidence was in. The relevant documents which were lost, disappeared after they had been sent to the Roche Nutley patent department - the division of the company which above all others should have been concerned to ensure that documents relevant to a patent claim were properly preserved. No representative of the patent department was called to give any explanation as to the disappearance of those documents.
[61]
In FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED, it was held that when an invention date earlier than the filing date of a patent application is claimed the patentee has the burden of proof. He or she must establish the date claimed and must adduce cogent evidence for this purpose. I cannot conclude that the defendant, in this case, has met that test.
Conclusion and Other Considerations
[62]
Before he began any testing, Dr. Grunberg was told that trimethoprim potentiated sulphonamides. He was told that it had been clinically effective against infections caused by sulphonamide resistant bacteria. There was nothing innovative in his choosing to combine sulphamethoxazole with trimethoprim, as opposed to any other sulphonamide then on the market. It was an entirely obvious and anticipated step to take.
[63]
Secondly, I do not think that Dr. Grunberg's attention was focussed on determining whether the drug combination was effective against sulphamethoxazole resistant bacteria in particular, either before or after he tested the combination drug. All the evidence leads to the conclusion that what was being confirmed by Dr. Grunberg was
the potentiation of sulphonamides in general
by trimethoprim, a result which was already part of the common knowledge. Dr. Grunberg's actions certainly broke down management resistance on the part of Burroughs Wellcome to developing the combination drug for market use. He deserves to be given credit for the fact that trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole is now on the market and now available to the public for the treatment of disease. But he cannot be called the inventor. I would therefore allow the plaintiff's action and grant a declaration that the defendant's patent number 1,003,331 is invalid for the reasons given.
[64]
Thirdly, if it were necessary to do so I would hold that an alternate ground for declaring patent number 1,003,331 invalid is that as a reissue patent it attempted to claim an invention other than that which was originally claimed. As noted above, the particularity added to the patent on reissue (the limitation with respect to effectiveness against sulphamethoxazole resistant strains) was not a focus of the work originally done by Dr. Grunberg. The reissue was not sought merely for the sake of correcting an error which had arisen as a result of inadvertance, accident or mistake [see footnote 5]. (See Farbwerke Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft v. Commissioner of Patents (1966), 50 C.P.R. 220 (S.C.C.)). It was an attempt to claim an invention different from that which had been claimed in the original patent.
[65]
I do not propose to deal with the other grounds of attack raised by the plaintiff, except to say that in my view the attack based on s. 41(1) would not prevail. While the mixing of the two drugs with the excipient material for the purpose of making tablets involves hydrogen bonding this is not the subject of the invention. I accept counsel for the defendant's argument that s. 41(1) speaks of the
invention of a substance that is prepared
or produced
by a chemical process
. In the present case the invention is not the preparation of a substance. It is the combining of two substances already produced. The inert excipient material plays no part in the invention. (Section 41(1) of the Patent Act reads as follows:
"In the case of inventions relating to substances prepared or produced by chemical processes and intended for food or medicine, the specification shall not include claims for the substance itself, except when prepared or produced by the methods or processes of manufacture particularly described and claimed or by their obvious chemical equivalents.")
[66]
After most of these reasons in this case were written and after decisions had been made on almost all aspects, although this was obviously not known to counsel given that neither reasons nor an order had yet issued, counsel for the plaintiff wrote to the Registry and asked that judgment be reserved until he had had time to make an application to adduce further evidence. I decided not to grant that informal request because the reasons and decisions were so far advanced. This refusal to reserve judgment for any further period of time is made without prejudice to either party to make an application for the hearing of further evidence, after the reasons and judgment in this case have been communicated to them, if they should still wish to do so.
[67]
Lastly, the defendant adduced several documents at trial (Exhibits 68-73) the admissibility of which was challenged. They are tendered as relevant to prove that the plaintiff's product infringed that of the defendant. They were not referred to in argument by counsel and given my disposition of the matter I do not need to refer to them either. What is more had the patent been valid I do not think the issue of infringement would have been hotly contested - the plaintiff would have, or should have conceded such to be the case. Nevertheless, in order to tidy up the record, it is my view that Exhibits 68, 69, 69A and 69B (the Drug Formularies) are admissible as relating to proof of infringement. But they would only be evidence of the fact that the provincial governments in question advertised the two products to be interchangeable. On the issue of infringement this would have miniscule probative value. Thus while I think they are admissible their weight would not be great. Exhibits 70, 71, 72 and 73 are inadmissible. I cannot see how they relate to any issue before me.
Application allowed.

Footnotes
1. As I understand it, this is a highly simplified version of the process. I note that in Exhibit 78 (Hitchings affidavit included therewith) what I have referred to above as stage one is described as the second enzyme catalysed reaction of the metabolic pathway and what I have referred to as stage two is described as the fourth reaction:
"...
It is now known
to be the common property of the sulphonamides to inhibit the second of these enzyme catalysed reactions. Trimethoprim inhibits the fourth reaction and combining it with a sulphonamide provides a
sequential blockade
in the bacterial or protozoal folic acid pathway. As a consequence the effect of using the two drugs together is more that the additive effect of using each of the drugs singly ..." (underlining added)

The classical touchstone for obviousness is the technician skilled in the art but having no scintilla of inventiveness or imagination; a paragon of deduction and dexterity, wholly devoid of intuition; a triumph of the left hemisphere over the right.
