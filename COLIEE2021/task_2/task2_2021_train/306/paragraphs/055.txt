When one heard of the seemingly cumbersome base rotation boom described ("other competitive booms have had the rotation in the rear end where you have to rotate two or three tons, 2000 to 3000 kilos and that is much more clumsy ... when you rotate only the feed it is 500 to 600 kilos") one had the clear impression that they had been superseded. They had not, however, been driven out of the market and a Tamrock with base rotation still takes a good part of the Canadian market. The evidence also indicated that despite the inventions in suit which had been known for ten years, the plaintiff only had 10% to 20% of the Canadian market in 1977. Reference might also be made to the evidence of Dr. Lundquist reproduced in paragraph 88 of these reasons.
