We are concerned here with two claims in the parallel keeping patent, and one claim in the feed rollover patent which read as follows:
Patent No. 886975
Claim 1:
A hydraulic parallel motion means and drill boom supported drilling apparatus comprising a drill boom, a feed shell supported thereon and carrying a rock drill movable therealong, a boom support, horizontal and vertical pivot means disposed between said drill boom and said boom support and between said drill boom and said feed shell, hydraulic angle rams pivotally coupled across each of the pivot means for adjustment of the angle of elevation and angle of lateral swing on the one hand between the boom support and the drill boom and on the other between the drill boom and the feed shell, hydraulic pilot ram across the horizontal pivot means between the boom support and drill boom and pivotally connected to said boom support and said drill boom whereby to sense the setting of the elevation angle of said drill boom, the hydraulic angle ram across the horizontal pivot means between said drill boom and said feed shell being hydraulically slave coupled to the hydraulic pilot ram by an adjustment circuit including hydraulic passages connecting opposed cylinder chambers of the hydraulic pilot ram with cylinder chambers of corresponding volume in the hydraulic angle ram slave coupled therewith whereby to maintain constant the difference in elevation angle between the elevation angles at said horizontal pivot means during hydraulic actuation of the hydraulic angle ram coupled across the horizontal pivot means between the drill boom and the boom support, separate throttle valve and connecting conduit means connected to each hydraulic angle ram from providing manually controlled hydraulic adjustment of each hydraulic angle ram, first hydraulic locks between the adjustment circuit of the slave coupled hydraulic angle ram and the throttle valve and connecting conduit means thereof for maintaining within the adjustment circuit the pressure arising therein, and additional hydraulic locks associated with each of the opposed cylinder chambers of said angle rams pivotally coupled across the horizontal pivot means.
Claim 2:
A hydraulic parallel motion means and drill boom supported drilling apparatus according to claim 1 including a second hydraulic pilot ram across the vertical pivot means between the boom support and the drill boom whereby to sense the setting of the side swing angle of said drill boom, the hydraulic ram across the vertical pivot means between the drill boom and the feed shell being hydraulically slave coupled to the second hydraulic pilot ram by an additional adjustment circuit including hydraulic passages connecting opposed cylinder chambers of the second hydraulic pilot ram with cylinder chamber, of corresponding volume in the hydraulic angle ram slave coupled therewith whereby to maintain constant the difference in side swing angle between the side swing angles at said vertical pivot means during hydraulic actuation of the hydraulic angle ram coupled across the vertical pivot means between the drill boom and the boom support, and hydraulic locks in the additional adjustment circuit between the adjustment circuit passages of the slave coupled hydraulic angle ram therein and the throttle valve and connecting conduit means thereof for maintaining within the additional adjustment circuit the control pressure arising therein.
Patent No. 895025
Claim 1:
A drill boom structure comprising a boom pivotably mounted on a substructure at one end so as to be laterally and vertically swingable, a boom head pivotably mounted on the opposite end of said boom for motor actuated swinging about a first axis, a carrier pivotably mounted on said boom head for swinging about a second axis perpendicular to said first axis, a feed bar for guiding a rock drill in a feeding direction mounted on said carrier, said carrier comprising a hinge means for swinging said feed bar through a wide angle about a third axis, which is perpendicular to said second axis and normally parallel with said feeding direction independently of the direction of the carrier relative to the boom, and hydraulic motor means for actuating said hinge means disposed co-axial to said third axis.
