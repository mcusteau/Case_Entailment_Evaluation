This is an action for infringement of the plaintiff's rights under Letters Patent No. 886,975 and Letters Patent No. 893,025. The two inventions relate to improvements in the art of underground tunnelling and more particularly hydraulically controlled drilling. Patent No. 886,975 has to do with automatically keeping the rock drill parallel to its last drilling position as the boom is swung up and down, and also optionally, as it is swung sideways. It is referred to throughout the trial as the "parallel keeping patent". The other patent no. 895,025 has to do with the capability of rolling the rock drill in its supporting assembly (generally referred to as the feed) around an axis parallel to the drilling direction. For the purposes of this trial it is referred to as the "feed rollover patent".
