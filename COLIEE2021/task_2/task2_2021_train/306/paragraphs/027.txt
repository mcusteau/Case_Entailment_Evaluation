The time-saving according to Mr. Fernstr√∂m is given at page 85 of the evidence and reads:
"A rough example of savings achievable during a normal drill round when Rollover plus parallel holding was introduced can be gathered from the following.
(
Without parallel-holding)
-
Total drill time (
70-80 holes
)
4 hours
Per hole drilling
3 min
Per hole positioning
1-2 min
(
With parallel-holding
)
-
Today with
hydraulics
2.5 hours
Per hole drilling
1.5 min
Per hole positioning
0.5 min
"Q.	Can you explain what you intended by hydraulics in--
A.	Hydraulics is that in
1973 we also went over from pneumatic rock drills to hydraulic rock drills and that increased the penetration speed by 100 per cent
. So, instead of taking three minutes to drill a hole, it cut down to half--one-and-a-half minutes. And when we cut down the drilling time for this four-metre-long rock, for instance, then it is also important to cut down the positioning time so that the productivity rate increases.
"That is why also the hydraulics are available and the rollover cuts down the positioning time to roughly half --from between one and two minutes down to half a minute. So this indicates
the importance of these two concepts is to increase the productivity for the user
."
