Mr. Fernstr√∂m, in dealing with the market position, stated at page 93 of the evidence:
"For Atlas Copco the heavy booms BUT 14-15 with parallel holding systems and rollover rotation completely changed our market position. From very minor market shares (less than 10%) we over these years took up to
70-80% of the tunnel rig market
in especially construction but also in mining of larger tunnels."
