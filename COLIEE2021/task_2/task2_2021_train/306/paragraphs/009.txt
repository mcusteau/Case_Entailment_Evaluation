Before making any other determination the court is bound to determine the proper construction of the specifications and claim of the patents concerned. As counsel for the plaintiff put it "What did the specification fairly disclose and what do the claims in suit fairly claim?" The court is assisted in this by long established and well understood principles of patent law. The first one is that the issue of the patent raises a presumption in favour of the patentee that the invention covered thereby is valid subject matter of a patent and is the result of an exercise of the inventive faculty. The onus of proof is on the party who attacks the patent. Also "the court may, and generally must, be assisted by expert evidence to explain technical terms, to show the practical working of machinery described or drawn and to point out what is old and what is new in the specification ... But after all, the nature of the invention for which a patent is granted must be ascertained from the specification and has to be determined by the judge and not by a jury, nor by any expert or other witness." Brooks v. Steele and Currie (1896), 14 R.P.C. 46, at p. 73.
