It sounded therefore very efficient compared to a nonparallel holding system, when he stated:
"... if you do not have parallelity, you must swing the boom in the rear end, you must lift the boom in the rear end, and then you must correct, and if you swing the boom, the feed goes off like that. If you lift it, you get a sort of conical movement. Then you have to make corrections both vertical and sideways.
"Then you have to do that a number of times until you are exactly in front of the hole that you want to drill, and this is what takes two or three minutes.
"When you are in a long, dark tunnel, it is very hard for the operator to see exactly what is parallel. Therefore, they often have two people, one working up at the face of the tunnel to put a stick in a hole that has been drilled earlier and that way trying to compare the direction that it was parallel with a wanted direction of the tunnel."
and later:
"... when we came over to this burn cut drilling, the demand for accuracy increased quite a lot, and this also, with the parallel holding, in combination with the rollover, meant that you could have the holes concentrated in the middle and really reached the holes
even with two booms at the same time in the cut
