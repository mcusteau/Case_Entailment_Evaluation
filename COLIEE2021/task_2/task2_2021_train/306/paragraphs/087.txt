It was conceded that there are only three places that one can rotate a boom: at the base end, on the axis of the boom rotating one part of the boom relative to the other, and at the top end or feed. Evidence was adduced that base rotation was known at the time of the invention and that rotation on the axis of the boom was already known. We heard that, as booms get heavier, if you use a bigger boom, one moves the rotation from the base to the top end of the boom, and the reason you do that is that it is lighter. You do not have to rotate the entire weight of a big boom if all you rotate is the feed at the end of the boom.
