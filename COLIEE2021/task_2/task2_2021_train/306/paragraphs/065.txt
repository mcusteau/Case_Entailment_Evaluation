It's interesting to note that in the Bronder patent (Exhibit D-50) Mr. Bronder came up with four different ways of designing a hydraulic system for use in a parallel keeping arrangement. As counsel for the defendant points out:
"Mr. Kimber then took a great deal of time designing the
geometry
of the boom. Exhibits P-43, P-44, and P-47 were produced to show some of his work. None of these drawings show any hydraulic system. In fact, no hydraulics drawing of a complete system, prior to the filing of the Swedish patent application in November, 1966, has been produced."
