Mr. Kimber did not have his original sketches, and was asked by his counsel to reproduce them to the best of his ability and recollection. He did so. However, Mr. Rönne, the hydraulic expert, also did not have his original sketches nor was he asked to reproduce his sketch to the best of his recollection and ability. Thus we have no idea what his sketch looked like and we were told hydraulics are the essential part of the invention. I found it somewhat strange that none of the original sketches were kept or could be located because these would have been useful to the patentee in establishing a date of invention, and possibly crucial in any court test of the patent. Thus, we have no idea what that "quick sketch" made by Mr. Rönne in fact contained.
