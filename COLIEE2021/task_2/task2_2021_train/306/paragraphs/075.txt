The other elements in the patent are not new. The cross-examination of Mr. Fernström alone clearly establishes this fact. The evidence-in-chief of Dr. Lundquist leaves no room for doubt and, save and except for hydraulic locks, patents would be clearly read to have the same function as the claims in suit. Contrary to the view and opinion of Mr. Fernström, Dr. Lundquist was able to show many instances where former patents and earlier manufactured machines could teach everything in the patent in suit. As an example, in Smith U.S. Patent 835,261 certain axis are indicated, "the collar allows the boom to be slid up and down in a vertical direction for positioning of the drill. It also allows the boom to swing from side to side, which would provide part of the horizontal positions of the drill". This patent dates back to the early 1900's. At page 942 of the evidence, Dr. Lundquist:
"... the identical method for keeping objects on the end of a boom parallel to their original orientation was well known at the time by at least 1960 and had been used before for many different objects on ends of booms. In some cases, the equipment with which it was used was mining type equipment. Further the plaintiffs were not the first to apply the idea of parallel keeping to a drill feed ... the constructions which the plaintiff called 'hydraulic locks' were well known by at least 1960."
Dr. Lundquist himself was surprised to find a standard hydraulics textbook dated 1949 which explained the idea of hydraulic locks.
