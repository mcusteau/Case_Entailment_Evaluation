  Former rule 480 enabled a party who wished to proceed to trial without adducing evidence of any issue of fact including, inter alia, questions as to the damages caused by or profits arising from the infringement of a right, to seek a determination by a reference of such issues after trial under rule 500, et seq. Rule 476 also authorised the court to order that a question be decided at trial before discovery on some issue that depended on the determination of that question.
