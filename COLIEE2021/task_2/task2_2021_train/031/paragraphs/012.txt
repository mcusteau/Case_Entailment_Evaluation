  My conclusion is that Giles, A.S.P., was broadly correct to state that the exercise of the court's discretion under rule 107 to order a separate trial or a reference of remedial issues is subject to the principles applicable under former rule 480. However, those principles, and the jurisprudence establishing them, must be read subject to two changes made by the 1998  
 Rules 
 . First, rule 107 gives the court more flexibility in the sense that, unlike the former rule 480, the court may now order a severance of issues even though the severed issues may not be suitable for determination on a reference because, for example, they raise issues of both fact and law. Second, like all provision of the new  
 Rules 
 , rule 107 must be read subject to rule 3, and accordingly "applied so as to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of any proceeding on its merits". However, since the saving of time and expense was also understood to be the rationale of the former rule 480 (see  
 Brouwer Turf 
 , loc. cit.), not too much should be made of this point in this context.
