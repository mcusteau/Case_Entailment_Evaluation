  Accordingly, on the basis of previous authority and in light of the changes introduced by the 1998  
 Rules 
 , I would formulate the test to be applied under rule 107 as follows. On a motion under rule 107, the court may order the postponement of discovery and the determination of remedial issues until after discovery and trial of the question of liability, if the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that in view of the evidence and all the circumstances of the case (including the nature of the claim, the conduct of the litigation, the issues and the remedies sought), severance is more likely than not to result in the just, expeditious and least expensive determination of the proceeding on its merits.
