The Adjudicator agreed with the conclusion of the Level I Adjudicator that Ms. Marsh had not established that in her case RCMP policies and procedures were improperly applied. He then, in the excerpt from his decision quoted above at paragraph 12, turned to consider whether Ms. Marsh had been fairly treated. After noting that isolated cases had been dealt with in different fashions, the Adjudicator set out his interpretation that the provision was not intended to deal with a situation where a member would seek to relocate to a new job two years in advance of retirement. The Adjudicator then concluded, based upon his interpretation of the policy and the lack of evidence provided by Ms. Marsh, that she had been equitably and fairly treated.
