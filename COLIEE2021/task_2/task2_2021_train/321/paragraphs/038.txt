With respect to policy concerns, Ms. Marsh's concerns about delay were only raised before the Adjudicator. They were articulated as follows:
"As I have followed all required response time lines, as set by RCMP Policy in the grievance process, I am also aggrieved of the delay in attention and response to this matter by the RCMP. This grievance is, at this time, five years in process reflecting the administrative neglect by the RCMP to resolve this matter in an expedient manner."
