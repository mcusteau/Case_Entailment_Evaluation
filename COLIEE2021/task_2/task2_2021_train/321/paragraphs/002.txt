Ms. Marsh asserts that because of the unreasonable delay in dealing with her grievance the Adjudicator lost jurisdiction, or failed to observe a principle of natural justice or procedural fairness. Ms. Marsh also submits that the Adjudicator erred in law by finding that she was required to demonstrate that other members of the Force had been allowed to take their retirement relocation move and then remain with the force.
