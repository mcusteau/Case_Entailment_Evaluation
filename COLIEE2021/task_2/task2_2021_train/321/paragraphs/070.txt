The respondents seek costs. As a matter of law, costs generally follow the event. However, in the present case, counsel for the respondents was unable to point to any evidence that explained or justified the time spent in order to conclude the grievance process. While I have found that such delay does not warrant setting the decision aside, in the exercise of my discretion over costs, I find that such delay justifies depriving the respondents of their costs. Each party shall bear their own costs.
