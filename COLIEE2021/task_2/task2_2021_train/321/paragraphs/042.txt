Consistent with this view are the remarks of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Gill v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1984] 2 F.C. 1025; 60 N.R. 241 (F.C.A.). In the context of what it characterized to be "extraordinary bureaucratic delay" the Court wrote as follows:
"This is not, however, to say that I think that the Government can, by simple inaction, defeat rights which were clearly intended to be granted.
It may well be that
the recently discovered administrative duty to act fairly encompasses a duty not unreasonable to delay to act; or, put positively, that
the procedural duty to act fairly includes a duty to proceed within a reasonable time. It does not by any means follow, however, that the breach of such a duty would give rise to the setting aside of the tardy action when it is finally taken. The remedy surely is to compel timely action rather than to annul one that, though untimely, may otherwise be correct
