The court finds that the Adjudicator did not err when he found that the applicant was not a permanent resident, has never been granted citizenship, and that he is in that plight before the Adjudicator and before this court. A visitor is someone who is seeking admission or has already been admitted to the country for a temporary purpose. To be admitted as a visitor, a person must obtain a visitor's visa by applying to a Canadian embassy or consulate outside of Canada. Persons from certain countries, however, are exempted from this requirement. In the instant case, the applicant came to Canada on a visitor's visa which had eventually expired on March 19th, 1985. He was given the benefit of an order-in-council on November 20th, 1986 which allowed him to apply for permanent residency from within Canada. On September 4th, 1987, both his sister and brother signed their permanent residence documents. The applicant, according to his sister, was supposed to attend as well but was subject at that time to some sort of state custody, the "Home For Boys." The
Dass
case is conclusive in this matter, in particular if one looks at a passage, a very short one, from Mr. Justice Strayer in that case, who says, and that applies particularly to the case at bar, that:
"Nor can I find any provision in the
Act
for a cut-off date beyond which an immigration officer should ignore a change of circumstances. It follows that any new circumstance, such as serious criminal conviction, can be taken into account at any time up to when a decision concerning the grant of landing is actually taken and communicated to the applicant."
