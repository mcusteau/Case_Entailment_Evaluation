Mr. Keqaj alleges that his family members contacted both the police and the village elder to try and resolve the problem. The elder, together with Mr. Keqaj's father and uncle went to the Lunaj family to try to negotiate a pledge of honor; however, the Lunaj family did not cooperate. As for the police, Mr. Keqaj alleges that they took no action, as is typical for potential blood feud situations. (Transcript of the Hearing, Tribunal Record, pp. 180-185).
