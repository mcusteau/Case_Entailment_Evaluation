The country reports before the Board clearly indicate that persons targeted by blood feuds, in Albania, could not:
...
safely relocate within the country
... Although the HRDC admitted that the situation surrounding blood feuds had improved, it claimed that avengers would be able to find their target within Albania, especially in the north of the country (ibid.). Similarly, the Justice and Home Affairs Coordinator for the European Commission delegation in Albania and the Representative of the Tirana-based Committee of Nationwide Reconciliation (CNR) stated that
Albania is small enough that avengers would be capable of finding their targets
(EU 13 July 2006; CNR 18 June 2006).
The CNR Representative added that
those targeted in blood feuds "are obliged to confine themselves [to their homes] or leave Albania
," after which the threat against them supposedly decreases (ibid.).
