The Board noted that Mr. Keqaj provided a Certificate from the Kastrat Commune, dated November 1, 2006, a Certificate from the Aldermen of the Ivanaj Village, dated October 1, 2006 and a letter from the Nationwide Reconciliation Mission "Mother Teresa", dated November 11, 2006. The Board stated that it gives the aforementioned documents little weight to offset the numerous credibility concerns. These documents, consist of the following:
• The Certificate from the Kastrat Commune, from the local Albanian government representative, certifies all of the salient details of the blood feud as recounted in the Applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF) and confirms that the blood feud is still in effect (Tribunal Record, p. 161).
• The Certificate is from the Alderman whom the Applicant's family had contacted to broker peace between the families. It confirms the blood feud between the Lunaj family and the Keqaj family over land. The Alderman notes that he tried to resolve the conflict, but was unsuccessful and that the blood feud still exists (Tribunal Record, p. 163).
• The third document, equally a certificate, recounts in detail the information provided in the PIF and confirms the ongoing nature of the blood feud.
