With regard to questions of procedural fairness and natural justice, the Supreme Court of Canada clearly stated, in
Canadian Union of Public Employees (C.U.P.E.) v. Ontario (Minister of Labour)
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539, at paragraph 100: "It is for the courts, not the Minister, to provide the legal answer to procedural fairness questions. It is only the ultimate exercise of the Minister's discretionary s. 6(5) power of appointment itself that is subject to the "pragmatic and functional" analysis"; therefore, the pragmatic and functional analysis is not to be applied and the reviewing Court shall consider all questions, including questions in regard to the adequacy of reasons, on a standard of correctness. (
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Charles
, 2007 FC 1146, [2007] F.C.J. No. 1493 (QL), para 24.)
