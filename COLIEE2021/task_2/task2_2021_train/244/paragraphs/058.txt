[58]
Justice Sean Harrington of the Federal Court, in
Skripnikov v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2007 FC 369, [2007] F.C.J. No. 528 (QL), determined that, by not sharing concerns, a panel failed to observe a principle of procedural fairness. This caused erroneous findings of fact arrived at in a perverse and/or capricious manner. Further, it was determined that natural justice demands that one be informed of the case one has to meet and be given an opportunity to meet it.
