Country Reports, in respect of Albania, on Human Rights Practices - 2005:
The country continued to experience high levels of violent crime. Many killings occurred as the result of individual or clan vigilante actions connected to traditional "blood feuds" or to criminal gang conflicts. According to the interior ministry, at least nine persons were killed during the year in blood feuds based on the medieval Code of Lek Dukagjini (the
kanun
), which was practiced particularly in the northern part of the country. Under the
kanun
,
only adult males are acceptable targets in blood feuds
; however, women and children often were killed or injured in attacks. According to the National Reconciliation Committee, approximately
738 families were effectively self-imprisoned during the year due to blood feuds. Fear of revenge in a blood feud also led approximately 50 families to live under protection outside of the country
and prevented approximately 200 children-75 of whom were considered to be in serious danger-from attending school.
Disputes over land
and trafficking in persons
remained the main grounds for blood feuds
