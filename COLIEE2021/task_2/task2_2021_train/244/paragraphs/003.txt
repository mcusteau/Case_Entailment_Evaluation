The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (Board) noted that the Applicant provided a Certificate from the Kastrat Commune, dated November 1, 2006, a Certificate from the Aldermen of the Ivanaj Village, dated October 1, 2006, and a letter from the Nationwide Reconciliation Mission, "Mother Teresa", dated November 11, 2006. The Board stated that it gave the following documents insufficient weight to offset the numerous credibility concerns. These documents indicate:
• The Certificate from the Kastrat Commune, from the local Albanian government representative, certifies all of the salient details of the blood feud as recounted in the Applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF) and confirms that the blood feud is still in effect (Tribunal Record, p. 161).
• The Certificate from the Alderman the Applicant's family had contacted to broker peace between the families confirms the blood feud between the Lunaj family and the Keqaj family over land. The Alderman notes that he tried to resolve the conflict, was unsuccessful and that the blood feud still exists (Tribunal Record, p. 163).
• The third document, equally a certificate, recounts in detail the information provided in the PIF and confirms the ongoing nature of the blood feud.
