  Jun Yan raises certain issues with respect to the reasonableness of the officer's assessment per se. Upon consideration of the evidence and the arguments advanced by the parties, the court finds that the visa officer committed no reviewable error in her evaluation under sections 11(1) and 11(2) of the  
 Regulations 
 . Her findings in this respect were all pure findings of facts entirely within her mandate and they were all reasonable. ( 
 Lim v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1991), 121 N.R. 241 (F.C.A.), at 243.) None were made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before the officer.
