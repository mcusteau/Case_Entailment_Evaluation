  During his interview with the visa officer, Jun Yan admitted that he did not have a university degree in physiotherapy and that he had not done a period of supervised practical training in physiotherapy as required under the NOC for a research physiotherapist. The applicant also discussed at length his experience with computers. After several questions, the visa officer concluded that he was unable to answer basic questions on computer programming in either English or Mandarin. Finally, having tried unsuccessfully to reach the Shanghai Juaghai Computer Company to verify his actual experience, the visa officer concluded that Jun Yan could not have performed the duties listed in the NOC under the relevant occupations.
