A review of the decision of the Appeal Division shows that the Appeal Division
addressed the issue of whether the foreign legal requirements for adoption were met and it concluded that they were not. In reaching this conclusion, the Appeal Division concluded that there had been no separation of the children from their natural parents as the children continued to live in the same compound as their natural parents and grandmother. In reaching this conclusion, the panel did not accept as credible, the evidence offered on appeal, that the natural parents had moved to a home a kilometer away from the compound 10 years or so earlier. The reason given by the Appeal Division was a valid and a correct reason and is not reviewable by this court.
