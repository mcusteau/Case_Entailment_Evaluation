However, the decision of the Appeal Division also dealt with the second part of
the process used when determining whether the children have been adopted for the purposes of Canadian law (
Immigration Act
, s. 2(1)) i.e. "Whether the adoption creates a genuine relationship of parent and child". The decision of the Appeal Division deals with this issue when it addressed the applicant providing money for the children's education and for their maintenance and that it also addressed the great interest of the applicant and his wife in the education of the children. The Appeal Division found the conduct to be that of a loving uncle and concluded that no genuine relationship of parent and child existed between the applicant and the children. This finding of the Appeal Division is supported by the evidence and is correct in the circumstances of this case.
