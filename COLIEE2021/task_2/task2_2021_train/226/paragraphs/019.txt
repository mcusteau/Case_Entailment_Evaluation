Counsel for both parties agree that there is no decision directly on point as to how, in law, "being" in s. 37(1)(a) is to be interpreted. The word being although having a clear connotation of a present tense, has also been interpreted so as to include that which was in the past. The following appears in
Stroud's Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases
, 6th Ed., London, Sweet & Maxwell, 2000, Vol. 1 at page 254 in respect of "Being":
"BEING. 'Being', as used in a sense similar to that of the ablative absolute, has sometimes been translated as, 'having been', but it properly denotes a state or condition existent at the time when the conclusion of law or fact has to be ascertained.
"Thus the phrase, 'being a trader', in the
Bankruptcy Act 1869
(c.71), meant, 'carrying on trade at the time when the act in question is committed' (per Jessel, M.R., Exp. McGeorge, 20 Ch.D. 697; but see Carry On, towards end). Therefore a trader who had absolutely ceased trading was not liable to the consequences of a trader-debtor's summons under s. 6(b) of the
Act
(Exp. Schomberg, 10 Ch. 172), nor to be adjudicated bankrupt for departing from his dwelling under subs. (3), s. 6 (Exp. McGeorge, supra,); but if he had the intention to resume trading he was still a trader (Exp. Salaman, 21 Ch. D. 394).
"But 'any two or more persons being partners' (who may proceed, or be proceeded against, in the partnership name,
Bankruptcy Act 1883
(c. 52), s. 115) - see now 2.119,
Bankruptcy Act 1914
(c. 59) - does not connote that they must be partners at the time of the proceedings, but rather means, persons 'Who have had the relationship of partners for the purpose of the liability which is sought to be enforced' (per Alvertsone, M.R.,
Re Wenham
, [1990] 2 Q.B. 698)."
