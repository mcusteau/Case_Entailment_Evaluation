Counsel for the Applicant argued in her Memorandum, paragraphs 23 to 30 and orally before me, that the Adjudicator made patently unreasonable errors in accepting both "raw data" evidence gathered by police as to so-called gang activity and the evidence of the police as witnesses without properly weighing that evidence as to whether it was "reliable and trustworthy" and without stating in his reasons that he weighed such evidence before coming to the conclusion that he did. In support of this argument, Applicant's counsel cited a number of criminal law cases and two
Children's Aid Society of Toronto v. A.M.
, [2002] O.J. No. 1432 (C.J.) and
Children's Aid Society of London and Middlesex v. A.M.
(1998), 68 O.T.C. 307 (Gen. Div.), dealing with sufficiency of affidavits presented in child custody situations.
