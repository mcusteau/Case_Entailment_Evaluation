The case of
Z端ndel, Re
(2005), 259 F.T.R. 36; 2005 FC 295, dealt in part with s. 37 at paragraph 18:
"18 Contrary to counsel for Mr. Z端ndel's submissions that the Ministers must demonstrate Mr. Z端ndel's current or future wrongdoings, pursuant to s. 33 of the
IRPA
, the Ministers can provide evidence or information of past, present or anticipated future circumstances of Mr. Z端ndel's inadmissibility on security grounds. In
Al Yamani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2003 FCA 482; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1931, leave to Supreme Court of Canada denied August 26, 2004, [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 62, the Federal Court of Appeal recognized that the past conduct of individuals, particularly those who have engaged in activities which constitute a threat to the security of Canada, must be considered in the determination concerning inadmissibility:
'With respect, I think it is hard to conceive of many allegations more serious than one involving terrorism or membership, past or present, in a terrorist organization. Terrorist organizations by their nature are unpredictable. The existence of sleeper cells is widely recognized and the mere fact someone has lived peacefully in Canadafor many years does not preclude them from being a threat to the security of Canadians. Contrary to the appellant's arguments, an allegation that someone is a former member of a terrorist organization therefore is a very serious one. Therefore, the gravity of the allegations argues in favour of continuing the proceedings. ( ... ) (
