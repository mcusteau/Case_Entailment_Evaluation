The Federal Court of Appeal did not comment specifically as to the finding of O'Reilly, J., of the Federal Court in that case, (
Thanaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 166; [2004] 3 F.C.R. 301 (F.C.)) as to the meaning of "organization" in s. 37(1)(a). O'Reilly, J., found at paragraphs 29 to 31:
"29 No guidance is given in the
Immigration Act
or the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
as to what an 'organization' is. By contrast, the
Criminal Code
, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46, s. 467.1(1) [as enacted by S.C. 1997, c. 23, s. 11; 2001, c. 32, s. 27] defines a 'criminal organization' in some detail. It states that a criminal organization is a group, 'however organized', that is made up of three or more persons and 'has as one of its main purposes or activities' the commission of serious criminal offences that would likely yield some kind of benefit to the members of the group. Specifically, a criminal organization under the
Code
does not include 'a group of persons that forms randomly for the immediate commission of a single offence'.
"30 The
Criminal Code
's definition does not apply directly to the immigration setting. However, I believe it is noteworthy that the
Code
does not require any particular formalities or decision-making arrangements. Presumably, to meet the definition, a group must have some form of organizational structure. The words 'however organized' suggest that it must be organized in some fashion, but there are no minimum or mandatory attributes that the group must have.
"31 Here, the two Tamil groups described by the police had some characteristics of an organization -- identity, leadership, a loose hierarchy and a basic organizational structure -- and I can therefore find no error in the Board's conclusion that they fell within the terms of paragraph 37(1)(a) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
."
