Applicant's counsel argues that the word "being" in the phrase "being a member of an organization" in s. 37(1)(a) means that at the relevant time, the person must be a member of that organization, not "have been" in the past, but actually "be" at the relevant time. When asked by the Court as to what the relevant time was, counsel said that time was the time that he was reported. Counsel argued that s. 33 which speaks of matters "that have occurred, are occurring, or may occur" related only to factual matters and that in law s. 37(1)(a) requires that the person be a member of an organization in respect of which those factual findings may be made at the time of the report.
