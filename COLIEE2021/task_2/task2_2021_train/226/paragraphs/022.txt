Therefore, to read s. 37(1)(a) in context, one finds that s. 33, albeit restricting itself to facts, requires attention to past, present and future facts. Section 37(2)(a) permits the Minister to excuse persons from the effects of s. 37(1), something that most likely, but not always, applies to past events. To require that s. 37(1)(a) apply only to persons who, at the moment that they were reported, would severely hamper any real application of those provisions. All one would have to do, as was attempted here, is, at that moment, disavow membership or cease being a member of the organization.
