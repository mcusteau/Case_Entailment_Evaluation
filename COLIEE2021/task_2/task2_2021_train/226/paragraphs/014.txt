The interpretation in law of s. 37(1)(a) received attention in the recent case of
Thanaratnam
, supra, albeit not on the point now raised, in paragraphs 29 and 30 of the Federal Court of Appeal's Reasons:
"29 Having concluded that the Board had erred in finding that Mr. Thanaratnam was a 'member' of the V.V.T., the Applications Judge did not go on to consider whether the evidence that he was 'involved in gang related events' (the first criterion used by the police in identifying gang members) was sufficient to support a finding that he was inadmissible for engaging in activities that were part of the V.V.T.'s pattern of criminal activities, even if he did not 'belong' to the gang.
"30 In my opinion, this was an error of law. The structure of paragraph 37(1)(a) makes it clear that 'membership' of a gang and engaging in gang-related activities are discrete, but overlapping grounds on which a person may be inadmissible for 'organized criminality'. The 'engaging in gang-related activities' ground of 'organized criminality' was added by the
IRPA
and did not appear in its predecessor, paragraph 19(1)(c.2) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2. In order to give meaning to the amendment to the previous provision made by the
IRPA
, Parliament should be taken to have intended it to extend to types of involvement with gangs that are not included (or not clearly included) within 'membership'."
