[33]
Applicant's counsel submitted that the mere fact that charges had been laid or were in contemplation of being laid, is not a factor to take into consideration when making a determination as to whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person or an organization is criminal, particularly if the charges were never laid or were withdrawn. Counsel submits that the only relevant factors are the evidence behind those charges; cases such as
Bakchiev v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 18881; 196 F.T.R. 306 (T.D.) and
La v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 649; 232 F.T.R. 220 (T.D.), are given in support of this proposition.
