[10]
The applicant alleges that he explained, in a reasonable manner, the content of the pamphlets that he distributed on behalf of the UFC and that the panel erred in finding that he lacked credibility on that point. Further, the applicant claims that if his answers seem to be vague, it is rather because he had never gone to school and the panel was using a language that he was unable to understand. The transcript, at page 323, states:
[TRANSLATION]
Q. What did these pamphlets say?
A. I cannot give the exact dates, but I know that I did it until I left, once in awhile putting pamphlets in the street.
- Give me some examples.
A. The last one that I can remember before the elections is the pamphlet saying that we had to mobilize to confiscate, to reclaim the rights taken by the governmental authorities.
Q. What rights were those, Sir?
A. That’s what the pamphlet said, that’s because it wasn’t me that wrote it.
Q. Yes, but Sir, did you see the pamphlet?
A. [Not translated.]
- Okay
Q. Can you tell me what rights the government had taken away?
A. For example, what it was about, it was that we wanted customs to be open 24 hours a day, for the economy, and also the arbitrary arrests of soldiers in the streets, who asked you to park and then they asked you to give them change. The fact is that they will ask you for papers, all the papers are in order, but they will not give you the papers back, until you give them money. The fact also is also to share power. [sic]
