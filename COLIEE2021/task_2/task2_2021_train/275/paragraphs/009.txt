In this case, the panel described the applicant’s testimony as being vague, particularly when he was questioned about the UFC, the ideology of that party and the content of the pamphlets that he distributed for them.
The claimant is not credible. The panel is incapable of reconciling the Togolese customs work schedule and the corruption of the soldiers assigned to traffic with the “rights” of the Togolese population that were denied by the government. The panel notes that the claimant was saying anything and everything to justify his ignorance.
