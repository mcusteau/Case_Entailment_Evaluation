On January 5, 2002, three men visited the applicant, proposing that he transport people on Mono Boulevard for six consecutive days. The next day, when the applicant reported to the site of the meeting, the people that were there wanted to put giant posters of President Eyadema on his car and oblige him to wear a T-shirt commemorating the president and a cap of the Rally for the Togolese People (UFC), the party in power. The applicant categorically refused and, when threatened, fled.
