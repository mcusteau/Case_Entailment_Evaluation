The statement of claim, which contains a number of short and quite concise paragraphs, is a good deal more brief than many statements of claim in patent and trademark litigation. Brevity in a statement of claim, so long as it does not either leave the defendant guessing or make the hearing of the action difficult to regulate when the case is tried, is a virtue. Others might draft the statement of claim differently than has been done here. That is not a ground to say that this statement of claim does not limit and define the issues to be tried.
