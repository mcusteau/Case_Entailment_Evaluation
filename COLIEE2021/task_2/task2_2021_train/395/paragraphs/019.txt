At this point in the statement of claim, we reach paragraph 21, setting out that:
"21. Further still, in view of the aforesaid, the defendant's said registration of the PNEUMOCORT trademark is invalid and ought to be expunged as:
(a) the PNEUMOCORT trademark was not registrable at the date of registration;
(b) the PNEUMOCORT trademark was not distinctive at the date this proceeding was commenced; and
(c) the defendant was not the person entitled to secure the PNEUMOCORT registration."
This is the paragraph about which the defendant submits needs particulars.
