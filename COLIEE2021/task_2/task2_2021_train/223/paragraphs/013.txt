  Mr. Wood appealed this decision regarding his low back pain on the grounds that the Entitlement Board had erred in fact and law in concluding that the evidence did not support a service-related injury, and in concluding that there was insufficient evidence of permanent worsening of the injury. In addition, the applicant submitted that the evidence demonstrated low back problems not only in service, but because of service related activities, and that the disability has persisted and become permanently worsened by virtue of service related activities.
