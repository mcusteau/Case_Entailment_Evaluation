[49]
In making the decision of May 5, 2006 now under review, the Minister's official took the position that the post-February 15, 2005 version of the
Regulations
was the operative provision so far as subsection 34.1(4) was concerned, thus the 18 month period would run from the date of the application, October 2004. Even if the earlier version of subsection 34.1(4) were to apply, the Minister took the position that a later date, what he described as the "date of notification of the decision" would apply (presumably February 14, 2005). Given that position, the Minister, erroneously concluded, that no award prior to the date of application could be made. To reiterate part of what was said at page 11 of the decision of May 5, 2006:
"The request for review of the Department's original February 14, 2005 decision was by letter from RK to VAC dated March 15, 2005. Therefore, the above mentioned section 34.1 as amended effective February 15, 2005 may be considered for the purposes of this appeal.

"A significant period may elapse between the date of an applicant applies for benefits, services or care under the VHCRs and the date that the applicant's eligibility thereto is determined. That being said, were it to be determined that the earlier version of subsection 34.1(4) is applicable for the purposes of this final decision, then VAC's position is that the former version may have been more generous but still does not lead to the conclusion in support of the claim for reimbursement. The 18 month period to make a claim for payment or reimbursement of expenditures would have commenced at the date of notification of the decision granting eligibility rather than from the earlier date of application.
"In conclusion, neither the present or former terms of subsection 34.1(4) would permit the retroactive award from a date prior to the date of application for care."
