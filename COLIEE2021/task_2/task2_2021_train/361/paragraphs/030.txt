Applicants' Counsel argues that the
Regulations
fail to make provision for care of or access by those who are not mentally competent. This is not a "discriminatory" provision of the
Regulations
but, taking the argument at its best, failure to make special provision for one particular group of persons. There is no "discrimination" in the
Regulations
, all persons are treated the same, no group directly or indirectly is discriminated against and application of the
Regulations
does not have a discriminatory effect. The Applicants simply do not get beyond point (1) of the
Law
test.
