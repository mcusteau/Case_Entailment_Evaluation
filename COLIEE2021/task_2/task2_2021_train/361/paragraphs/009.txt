A review was requested. Ronald and solicitors acting for Horace both made written submissions. A review decision by letter dated November 15, 2005 from a Regional Director General (Bastien) maintained the original decision. In substance it said:
"Your file was carefully reviewed and every consideration has been given to your case. Unfortunately, the decision rendered must be maintained as it is in accordance with our regulations. In fact, a client is eligible to receive indeterminate care or chronic care in a departmental facility, contract bed or other facility when the client's health needs are confirmed by a nurse's or area counsellor assessment, which was completed in October 2004."
