As to "eligibility" the
Regulations
do not state that the DVA is to determine eligibility nor is any process for such determination by the DVA or anybody else set out. Paragraph 22.1(1)(a) simply says that certain persons "are eligible". Even if the DVA was to satisfy itself in that regard, and it is quite reasonable for it to do so, there is nothing in the
Regulations
that would entitle a person to benefit only as of the date that such a determination is made. There is simply no basis for the statement made at page 11 of the Hebert decision that:
"Eligibility is not established until a decision to that effect is rendered by [DVA]"
