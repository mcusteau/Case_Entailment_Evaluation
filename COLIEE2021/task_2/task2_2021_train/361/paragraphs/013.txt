The parties each state that most of the facts are not in dispute. A brief chronology:
• World War II: Horace served with the Canadian military. He remained in Canada and was not posted to an area of active combat. During the period of his service, he injured his right knee for which he received a pension amounting, in later years, to over $500.00 per month.
• April 1, 1999: Ronald was appointed Mandatary over the affairs of Horace.
• Mid 1999 into 2005: Ronald had concerns as to Horace's state of health. Horace was examined by medical specialists and diagnosed with dementia, medication is recommended (Dr. Kirk's letter of August 26, 1999).
• October, 1999: the DVA writes to Horace requesting that he complete and return a form so as to continue to receive his pension for his knee. Horace does not respond. It may be that the correspondence was mis-addressed.
• February 2000: DVA stops paying Horace a pension for his knee.
• June 17, 2000: Horace is placed in long-term care in Chateau Westmount.
• June 2000: Ronald states that he has communications with "someone" at DVA to advise them that Horace has been placed in a long-term care facility and that Ronald is his mandatary. Ronald also states that he filled out a form respecting Horace and his dementia and attached a note to that effect which he sent to the DVA. There is no documentary record to substantiate these allegations. A form received at a later time (about January 2001) is in the record but no note was attached.
• November-December 2000: a M. Jodoin from the DVA claims to have visited Horace's old address and placed telephone calls to Horace's existing number but was unable to identify Horace or his whereabouts. There is no direct evidence on this point.
• December 2000: Ronald has a telephone conversation with someone at DVA. A person identified as R.R. Baker at DVA made a record of a conversation occurring on December 13, 2000:
"Le 13 décembre 2000, le Dr. Rod Krasnick (chirurgien orthopédiste), fils de notre pensionné, a communiqué avec nous. Nous l'informons que la pension d'invalidité de son père est suspendue depuis le 1er février 2000 (allées et venues inconnues). Le Dr. Krasnick détient une procuration pour son père et sa mère. Mme. Krasnick (mère) réside présentement au Jewish Nursing Home, 5750 Lavoie. Le Dr. Krasnick demande que le conseiller de son père lui fasse parvenir la documentation nécessaire afin de rétablir les paiements de la pension d'invalidité de son père. Il expédiera une copie de sa procuration sur demande. Ses coordonées ont été inscrites dans le RPSC, sauf son numéro de facs qui est le suivant: 609 871-9301. Une activité est expediée à M. Jodoin ce jour pour information et toute action jugée nécessaire."
• The interaction between the DVA, Horace and Ronald in 1999 to 2001 is set out in an affidavit of the Respondent's affiant Orlanda Drebit, Director of Client Services and Quality Management and Service Policy Division, Veterans Services Branch of the DVA, at paragraph 27:
"a. Beginning in October, 1999, the DVA wrote a series of letters to HYK informing him that his Benefit Declaration had not yet been completed and he faced a possible suspension of his disability pension. The letter invited HYK to send in the information and contact the district office should he require further information. On February 10, 2000 a decision was made to suspend HYK's pension effective February 1, 2000.
"b. The benefit Declaration Form was finally completed in December, 2000 and received on January 21, 2001 under a Power of Attorney in the name of the Applicant RMK. The DVA decision of January 24, 2001 reinstating HYK's pension noted that contact with HYK was established. HYK subsequently attended a pension medical examination to assess his pension condition in February, 2001. The suspension was lifted, monthly payments resumed effective Feb 1, 2000 and back payments of $6676.75 were paid to HYK.
"c. A letter was sent to HYK on November 24, 2000 at his old address inviting him to attend a pension medical examination in relation to his pension condition. On January 10, 2001 the DVA sent another letter to HYK care of his new address at the Chateau Westmount inviting him again to attend a pension medical examination in relations to his pension condition. HYK then attended the examination on February 13, 2001. The medical examination resulted in an increase in the assessment of his pension condition to 30%. On October 2, 2001, a letter was sent to the address of his son RMK in New Jersey. The letter informed HYK of an increase in his pension to 30% for his knee condition. It invited him to contact the District Office if any further information is required."
• Two pages of the Benefit Disability Form (sometimes referred to as BD form) completed by Ronald on behalf of his father Horace are copied in the Record as part of Exhibit I to Drebit's affidavit and apparently were received by the DVA early in 2001. That form indicates Horace's address as being that of Ronald in the United States and Ronald's address label with the US address is attached. The document is undated. The printed portion of the form states, among other things:
"If you are completing this form on behalf of the member/former member of the forces, please attach a brief explanation."
There is no indication on any of the pages of the exhibit that he did so.
• February 2001: Horace is examined by a DVA person (presumably a medical practitioner) for his knee condition. His pension is restored. He is not examined in respect of his mental or other health conditions.
• October 2004: Ronald having learned by chance that benefits may be available to defray Horace's costs for his long-term care makes an application for benefits on Horace's behalf. That application is not in the record. In their letter dated January 11, 2006, the Applicants' solicitors at page 5 stated that October 2004 was the date of notification by the DVA of Horace's entitlement to make a claim as well as the application date.
