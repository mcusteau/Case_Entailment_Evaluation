  The refugee claims of the Applicants were denied on June 10, 2003, by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Board. In its reasons, the RPD found that the Applicants' failure to claim refugee status in the United States created negative credibility inferences, and that they had a viable internal flight alternative in Argentina. The Applicants did not seek judicial review of the RPD's decision regarding their claims.
