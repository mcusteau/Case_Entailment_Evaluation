  In the present case, the Officer did refer to the psychological assessment of the Applicants, and explained why she did not find it persuasive. As for the documentary evidence, there is a presumption that she has considered what was submitted to her by the parties, even though she did not specifically address each and every one of the country reports in her reasons. The Applicants are obviously entitled to differ with the Officer as regard her assessment of the situation in Argentina; but unless the Applicants can demonstrate that the Officer made an egregious error in weighing the documentary evidence, this Court will not intervene on judicial review.
