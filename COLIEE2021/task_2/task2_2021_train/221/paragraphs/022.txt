  The Applicants relied on section 11.2 of the IP5 Manual, according to which an applicant's degree of establishment in Canada "may be a factor to consider in certain situations", one of which is when the "prolonged inability to leave Canada has led to establishment". A note to that section further adds that "establishment of the applicant up to the time of the H & C decision may be considered". It was submitted that without a proper and reasonable consideration of establishment, the Immigration Officer could not make a reasonable assessment of whether the family would suffer undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship if returned to Argentina.
