  The Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear in Baker v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, that the applicable standard of review regarding a decision on an H & C application was reasonableness simpliciter. That decision has consistently been followed by this Court: see, for example, Adviento v. Canada(M.C.I.), 2003 FC 1430 [2003] F.C.J. No. 1837 (QL); Li v. Canada (M.C.I.), 2004 FC 1695 [2004] F.C.J. No. 2055 (QL); Malekzai v. Canada (M.C.I.), 2004 FC 1099 [2004] F.C.J. No. 1329 (QL); Lee v. Canada (M.C.I.), 2005 FC 413.
