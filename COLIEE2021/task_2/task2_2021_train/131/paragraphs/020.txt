  The jurisprudence placed the onus on the sponsor to prove that the applicant was not caught by subsection 4(3) of the former  
 Regulations 
 . In deciding whether or not an applicant has the intention of residing permanently with the sponsor, the applicant's intentions, not the sponsor's beliefs or intentions must be examined. ( 
 Canada (Solicitor General) v. Bisla 
 , [1994] F.C.J. No. 1785; 88 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.), at para. 10.) 
 
 
 
 "Accordingly, to determine whether a spouse is excluded under s. 4(3) the analysis imposed by  
 Horbas 
  must be made. However, despite the fact that it is the intention of the sponsored relative that is of primary importance, it is for the plaintiff to present evidence challenging the immigration officer's conclusion that the marriage was not a marriage in good faith, since the sponsor has the right of appeal.

 "What is clear from the precedents is that the plaintiff has a duty to establish on a balance of probabilities that the sponsored spouse did not get married solely in order to immigrate to Canada and intended to live permanently with him. Accordingly, despite the fact that it is the intention of the sponsored relative which is crucial, it is for the plaintiff to present evidence to challenge the immigration officer's conclusion that the marriage was not a marriage in good faith, since the right of appeal belongs to the sponsor."
