Accordingly, the application will succeed. Since here the visa officer has both breached a duty of fairness and committed an error of law, his decision is set aside. The respondent is directed to carry out the assessment in accordance with the Immigration Act and Immigration Regulations in a manner consistent with the interpretation placed upon them in these reasons for order. As indicated from the Bench, I did not deal with the claim related to assisted relatives as I assume that this matter can now be put forward during the reconsideration. The applicant will be entitled to his costs.
Application allowed.
