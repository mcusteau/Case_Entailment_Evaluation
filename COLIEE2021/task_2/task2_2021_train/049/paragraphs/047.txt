  While the Board's reasons leave much to be desired in terms of analysis, its ultimate conclusion cannot be held to be unreasonable. The Board pointed to several avenues of redress which the applicants could have pursued besides the local police. The

 PRESIDING MEMBER: Are you saying that the police in Guatemala are successful in catching the maras? 
 
 
 
 CLAIMANT: They are on the news you can see it every day and you can see that they catch the occasional one but as well as seeing them catch several of them you also see murders happening all over the place by these people.
