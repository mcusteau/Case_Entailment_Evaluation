  The documentary evidence is that state protection in Guatemala is lacking. The Board's National Documentation Package for Guatemala provided a Response to Information Request dated March 2, 2007 with respect to "Measures for protecting the population from criminal gangs". The document stated: 
 
 
 
 Corruption within the police force and a lack of resources complicate the battle against criminal gangs. President Berger himself has acknowledged the failure of Guatemala's 22,000 national police officers to control the criminal gangs, which reportedly have as many as 60,000 members. 
 
 
 
 While this evidence suggests that state protection in Guatemala is inadequate, other evidence on the record that the police are taking measures to protect the population from criminal gangs including the deployment of the soldiers on the streets to re-establish security from criminal gangs, the arrest of gang members, surveillance measures, and the creation of a special hotline for reporting extortion. Accordingly, it was reasonably open to the Board to find either that there is, or there is not, adequate state protection in Guatemala.
