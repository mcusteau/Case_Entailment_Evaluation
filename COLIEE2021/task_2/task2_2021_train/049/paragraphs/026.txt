  In reviewing the Board's decision on a reasonableness standard, the Court will consider "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process" and "whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 ,  
 supra 
 , at para. 47,  
 Khosa 
 ,  
 supra 
 , at para. 59). The Court will only intervene if the decision falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 ,  
 supra 
 , at para. 47,  
 Khosa 
 ,  
 supra 
 , at para. 59).
