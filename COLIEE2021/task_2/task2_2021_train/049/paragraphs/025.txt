  The second issue relates to a determination of the adequacy of state protection. This is a question of mixed law and fact. Post- 
 Dunsmuir 
  jurisprudence has held that adequacy of state protection decisions are reviewable under a standard of reasonableness ( 
 Eler 
  v.  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 334, per Justice Dawson at para. 6;  
 Pacasum 
  v.  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 822, per Justice de Montigny at para. 18;  
 Velasquez v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2009 FC 109, per Justice de Montigny at para. 13). The second issue is therefore reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
