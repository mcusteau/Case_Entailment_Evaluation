  The Board's analysis in regard to state protection is rather general. I am troubled by the staleness of some of the documentary evidence that the Board cites. This is highlighted by the more recent documentary evidence produced by the applicant which describes the inability of the Guatemalan authorities to tackle gang violence because of systemic corruption and lack of resources. The applicants also adduced evidence that shows public frustration with police protection.
