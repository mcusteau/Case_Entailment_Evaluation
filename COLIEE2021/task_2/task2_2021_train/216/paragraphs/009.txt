  On considering de novo the question of relevance, I find that the Ethier Affidavit evidence is relevant on the argument that the decision was pre-determined, but the weight to be given to it will be decided by the Judge hearing the judicial review application. I also find that there is a valid reason for delay in filing for the same reasons cited above for the Schwarz Affidavit.
