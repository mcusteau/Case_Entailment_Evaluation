The 2006 U.S. Department of State Report indicates that nearly 50% of women in South Korea were victims of domestic violence. In contrast, the 2005 Department of State Report submitted by Ms. Lee, which was not considered by the PRRA officer, indicates that domestic violence occurred in 30% of South Korean households. On its face, this evidence arguably suggests that far from diminishing, the incidence of domestic violence in South Korea had increased markedly in recent years. This in turn could arguably indicate that measures taken to combat the problem of domestic violence in South Korea were not working. If accepted, this evidence would clearly be material to Ms. Lee's application.
