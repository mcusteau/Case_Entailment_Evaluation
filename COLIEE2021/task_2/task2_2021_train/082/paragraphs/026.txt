 [26] 
  As argued by the Minister, serious issues arise in this case on whether the Member properly interpreted and/or respected the statutory scheme related to the detention and release under IRPA and IRPR, and in particular whether she erred: 
 
 
 
 (1) In releasing the respondent despite her finding the Minister is making reasonable efforts to establish her identity, that her identity had not yet been satisfactorily established and the Minister's investigation was legitimately ongoing in good faith; 
 
 
 
 (2) The Member took into account and balanced all of the factors set out in paragraph 248 of the IRPR and, in particular, balanced the reasons for detention (lack of identity), the length of time for detention, any lack of diligence on the part of CIC or CBSA with the alternatives for detention; 
 
 
 
 (3) The Member considered or properly applied the factors set out in section 247 of the IRPR and, in particular, whether there was conflicting evidence on the issue of identity provided by the applicant; and 
 
 
 
 (4) Had the Member failed to provide clear and compelling reasons to depart from the September 14, 2010 decision refusing to release the respondent?
