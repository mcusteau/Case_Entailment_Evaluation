  This is not a case where the respondent did not have any identification papers whatsoever. However, she was without her passport which she claims was used to travel by air from Colombo to Thailand and was left with her agent on his orders. The record indicates there is no evidence of her entry in Thailand by plane. What she produced by way of identification were: 
 
 
 
 (a) A National Identity Card (NIC) which was analysed to have been altered but the significance of the alteration is yet to be determined; 
 
 
 
 (b) Her birth certificate; 
 
 
 
 (c) Her marriage certificate; and 
 
 
 
 (d) She did not produce a birth certificate for the child.
