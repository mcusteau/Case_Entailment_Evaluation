Section 9(1)(b)(i) of the
Regulations
provides that a visa officer may issue a visa to an immigrant in the category of the applicant if the applicant is awarded at least 70 units of assessment. However, this is qualified by s. 11(3) of the
Regulations
, which confers discretion on a visa officer to issue a visa to a person who has not been awarded the normally required number of units of assessment, or to refuse a visa to a person who has attained the requisite units of assessment, if, in the officer's opinion, the number of units of assessment awarded does not accurately reflect the applicant's chance of successfully becoming established in Canada.
