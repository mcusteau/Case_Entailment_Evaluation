In this context it is important to bear in mind the principal objectives of the administration of immigration control. The first is to facilitate the entry into Canada of persons who meet the requirements set out in the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
. The second is to ensure that those who do not are excluded. Both objectives are of equal importance, and neither is likely to be achieved if visa officers do not adopt a procedure for determining visa applications that is calculated to produce accurate and thoughtful decisions. On the other hand, officers should not be burdened by procedural duties imposed by this court that prevent them from processing applications in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.
