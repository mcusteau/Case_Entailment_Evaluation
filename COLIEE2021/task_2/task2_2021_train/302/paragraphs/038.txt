However, when the visa officer considered another of the differences in the occupational descriptions, namely the Executive Secretary's acting on routine matters in the absence of the employer, her inquiries were much less thorough. First, she never asked the applicant whether he had the authority to sign the General Manager's name or initials in his absence; she seems only to have asked whether the applicant signed his own name. More importantly, however, the visa officer did not explore more broadly with the applicant the nature of his responsibility for routine matters in the absence of the General Manager. Whether the applicant had the authority to sign his own name was not a sufficiently close surrogate for "acting on routine matters" that the visa officer did not need to inquire further. Signing practices, after all, vary within, and among, businesses and other organizations.
