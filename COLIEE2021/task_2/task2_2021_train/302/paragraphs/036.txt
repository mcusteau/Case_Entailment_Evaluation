Since the difference between the descriptions in the
CCDO
of Executive Secretary and Secretary are so similar, the critical issues in this visa application concerned the aspects of the definitions that are different. Thus, in order to determine whether the applicant's duties included "research", the visa officer asked the applicant questions that were designed to establish precisely what he did when performing that aspect of his duty which he described as "compiling statistical data relevant to the activity of the department and preparing periodical reports depicting the overall status of purchasing activities for review by higher management". The visa officer tried to determine from the applicant's replies whether this involved the applicant in conducting "research", by which she meant adding his own analysis or thought, or finding out information for himself. She concluded that he merely compiled into a single report the information given to him by the different section heads, so that it could be read more easily by the company management, and that no "research" was therefore involved.
