The visa officer's questions were directed principally at two aspects of the applicant's current employment duties. First, the visa officer inquired whether the applicant signed letters and other documents when the General Manager Purchasing was absent. In the notes that the visa officer typed into the CAIPS during the interview, the visa officer recorded the applicant as saying that he "does not sign anything himself." When asked in cross-examination whether she enquired if the applicant signed on behalf of the General Manager Purchasing, rather than in his own name, the visa officer responded that she did not ask that question. The visa officer also stated, however, that the applicant told her that he did not sign anything, and that whatever needed signing would wait until the General Manager Purchasing returned.
