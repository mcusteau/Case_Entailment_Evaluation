[51]
Acme and Nguyen submit that the motion to bifurcate the issues of liability and remedy in this case is not a fresh step that deprives them of the right to appeal the consolidation order because the motion time lines were dictated by order of the Prothonotary. Based on the time lines set by the Prothonotary, Acme and Nguyen allege that waiting for the outcome of an appeal of the consolidation order would have deprived them of the opportunity to file a bifurcation order. In this circumstance, it is submitted that the motion to bifurcate should not be considered a fresh step in the consolidated action that deprives the defendants of their right to appeal the consolidation order.
