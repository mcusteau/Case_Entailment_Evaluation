The Prothonotary, in her decision, decided to grant consolidation because the two actions were based on the same alleged act of infringement with the only difference being that in action T-630-02, the defendant was Acme, which manufactured and sold the allegedly infringing articles and in action T-1361-03, Vogo seeks to find the defendant, Tam Nguyen personally liable for deliberately, wilfully and knowingly designing the infringing articles and directing the defendant Acme to manufacture and sell the same.
