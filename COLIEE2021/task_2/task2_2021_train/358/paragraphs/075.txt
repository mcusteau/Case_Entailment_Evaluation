The decision made by the Prothonotary in this case was whether or not two actions should be consolidated. This question is an interlocutory decision which is not vital to the final issue of the case. Thus, I must determine whether the decision of the Prothonotary to grant consolidation of the two actions was clearly wrong in the sense that the exercise of discretion was based upon a wrong principle or a misapprehension of the facts:
