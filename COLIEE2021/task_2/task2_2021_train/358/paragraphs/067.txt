The Prothonotary's order, in this respect, should only be overturned if it was clearly wrong in the sense of being based on a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts. I have reviewed the Prothonotary's decision and I am of the view that the refusal to grant the stay in action T-1361-03 was not clearly wrong in the
Aqua-Gem
, supra sense. The appeal of this aspect of the Prothonotary's decision is therefore dismissed.
e)
Are there grounds to order Vogo to provide further particulars in action T-1361-03?
