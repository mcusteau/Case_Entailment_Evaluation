With respect to striking the action in T-1361-03, Vogo asserts that a pleading should only be struck if it is plain and obvious that it will fail at trial. Vogo submits that a director and officer of a corporation, such as Nguyen, can be held liable for patent infringement where they engage in deliberate, wilful and knowing conduct that is likely to constitute infringement:
Mentmore Manufacturing Co. et al. v. National Merchandise Manufacturing Co.
(1978), 22 N.R. 161; 40 C.P.R.(2d) 164 (F.C.A.). On this test, Vogo argues that its allegations against Nguyen in his personal capacity have a legal basis on which it could succeed at trial and that Nguyen failed to meet the burden of proving the claim should be struck.
