By a separate order, the Prothonotary granted Vogo's motion for consolidation on the basis that the two actions were based on the same alleged act of infringement, the witnesses in the two actions would be the same, counsel were the same, consolidation would avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, would promote an expeditious and inexpensive determination of the issues in dispute and was necessary to avoid the real possibility of contradictory judgments on the underlying issue of infringement. The Prothonotary further reasoned that consolidation would not likely delay the conduct of either of the actions or otherwise result in any prejudice to the defendants.
