The Prothonotary made reference to the contents of Vogo's statement of claim in her decision. The Prothonotary stated that Vogo's statement of claim specifically alleges that Nguyen looks after all the business of Acme and it specifies the ownership interest of the defendant. The Prothonotary also noted that the statement of claim alleges that Nguyen "personally designed the allegedly infringing window locks sold by Acme at a time he was aware of the Plaintiff's patent, thus constituting (if the allegations are proven) wilful and wrongful interference of the Plaintiff's patent." The Prothonotary also noted that the statement of claim states that "the Defendant is the directing will of Acme, that it [he] makes the decisions as to the course of action of Acme and that after the Plaintiff requested Acme to stop its activities, the Defendant personally made the decision that Acme should continue selling the allegedly infringing locks."
