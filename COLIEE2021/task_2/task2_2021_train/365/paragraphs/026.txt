In Akhigbe v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 332 (F.C.T.D.) Dawson J. set out certain principles which govern the treatment to be given to evidence before the Convention Refugee Determination Division:
12 At the same time, certain principles govern the treatment to be given to evidence by the CRDD. Some, relevant to this application, are:
i) When a claimant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption exists that those allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. Maldonado v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1980] 2 F.C. 302 (F.C.A.);
ii) The CRDD is entitled to make reasonable findings based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality, and is entitled to reject uncontradicted evidence if not consistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole. Aguebor v. Canada (Minister Of Employment and Immigration) (1993), 160 N.R. 315 (F.C.A.); Shahamati v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] F.C.J. No. 415 (F.C.A.);
iii) While the CRDD may reject even uncontradicted testimony, the CRDD cannot ignore evidence explaining apparent inconsistencies and then make an adverse credibility finding. Owusu-Ansah v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 8 Imm. L.R. (2d) 106 (F.C.A.);
iv) Where the CRDD finds a lack of credibility based on inferences, including inferences concerning the plausibility of the evidence, there must be a basis in the evidence to support the inferences. Miral v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] F.C.J. No. 254 (F.C.T.D.);
v) In the absence of evidence to contradict the evidence of a claimant, it is an error for the CRDD to require documentary evidence corroborating the claimant's allegations. Ahortor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1993), 65 F.T.R. 137 (F.C.T.D.); Lachowski v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 18 Imm. L.R. (2d) 134 (F.C.T.D.); and
vi) The omission of a significant or important fact from a claimant's PIF can be the basis for an adverse credibility finding. Grinevich v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 444 (F.C.T.D.); Lobo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1995] F.C.J. No. 597 (F.C.T.D.).
