The Applicant points out that the whole point of reasons in a decision is to allow the Applicant to know why his case has been refused. Implausibility findings have to be based upon reasonable inferences from the evidence actually before the Board. In the case at bar, the Board never really makes the kind of clear and unmistakable credibility findings that the case law says are required for the Board to reject the Applicant's testimony.
