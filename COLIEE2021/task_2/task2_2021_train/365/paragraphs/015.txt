On the face of it at least, it is difficult to understand why the Board found the Applicant's description of how he went back to look for his cousin after the demonstration to be incredible. It seems plausible that the Applicant feared for his cousin's safety more than his own, and that the bonds of family loyalty may have led him to engage in risky behaviour that might otherwise be indicative of a lack of subjective fear. It is also possible that the Applicant's political convictions led him to engage in risky behaviour that may seem incredible to a Canadian observer.
