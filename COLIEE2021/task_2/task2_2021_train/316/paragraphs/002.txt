Ms. Augusto's claim for protection arises from an allegation that her mother was accused of stealing papers pertaining to a police strategy to defeat the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA). The police allegedly came to her mother's home (where Ms. Auguto lived) and forcibly entered the house. They unsuccessfully searched for the documents. Ms. Augusto says that her mother and her male cousin were beaten and her cousin was taken into custody by the police. Five days later, he was found murdered.
