Ms. Augusto initially presented two arguments: the PRRA officer applied the wrong burden of proof with respect to the analysis under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA) and, the officer's decision was made without regard to the evidence. In view of the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2005), 329 N.R. 346 (F.C.A.), the first argument, appropriately, was withdrawn. Thus, the sole issue, on this application, is whether the PRRA officer disregarded Ms. Augusto's evidence.
