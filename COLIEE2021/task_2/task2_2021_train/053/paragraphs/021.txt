  I do not think the defendants criticisms are justified. New expert reports had to be filed to take into account the testimony of the navigators at the original trial. Rebuttal reports are permissible. The clashing theories of the plaintiff's experts, highlighted during cross-examination, did not assist the plaintiff's case but, in weighing the evidence, this factor was not material to the decision and, in my view, in and of itself cannot justify an increase. Lastly, I do not agree the plaintiff had no case.
