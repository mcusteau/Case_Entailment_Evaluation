 [27] 
  I fix at the upper end of Column IV of Tariff B, the items proposed in the defendants' draft bill of costs. I fix disbursements at $22,308.96 and honorarium paid to the defendants' three experts at $80,838.51. No costs are awarded for this motion. I invite counsel for the defendants, with the consent of counsel to the plaintiff, to submit a bill of costs based on these reasons for my signature. 
 
 
 
 Order accordingly.
