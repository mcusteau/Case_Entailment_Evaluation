  In  
 Apotex Inc. v. Syntex Pharmaceuticals International Ltd. et al. 
  (1999), 176 F.T.R. 142 (T.D.), Justice Reed noted the purpose of awarding costs to a successful party had two aspects: to discourage unmeritorious litigation and to partially indemnify the successful party for the costs incurred in defending or prosecuting an action as the case may be. She noted the 1995 amendments to the  
 Federal Court Rules 
  introduced a new flexible scale of costs and conferred on the Court a broad discretion to direct additional costs beyond the amounts described in the Tariff in appropriate cases reflecting a philosophy, as expressed by Justice Wetston in  
 Apotex v. Wellcome 
 , supra, party-party costs should bear a reasonable relationship to the actual cost of litigation.
