 [26] 
  I deal with two remaining issues, namely, taxable disbursements and expert fees. As to the first item, counsel for the plaintiff did not raise any objections to the amount sought by the defendants. As to expert fees, counsel for the plaintiff did not put any evidence before me that such fees were unreasonable. In addition, counsel for the plaintiff did not substantiate the allegation that it was unnecessary to go abroad to retain experts. As a result, I accept the expert fees proposed by counsel for the defendants.
