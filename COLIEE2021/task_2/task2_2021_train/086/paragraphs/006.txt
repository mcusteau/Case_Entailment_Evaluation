  The Appeal Division treated the appeal under s. 77 as more than just a review of the immigration officer's decision on the basis of the evidence before him. The Appeal Division heard additional evidence, from the applicant, which was not before the immigration officer who made the initial refusal. It addressed its reasons to the evidence before it and decided the issues on that basis.
