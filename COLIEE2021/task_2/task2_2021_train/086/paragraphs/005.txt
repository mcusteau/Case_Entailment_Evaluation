  I do not think the Appeal Division erred in the approach it took. The relevant provision of the  
 Immigration Act 
  provide: 
 
 
 
 "77(1) Where a person has sponsored an application for landing made by a member of the family class, an immigration officer or visa officer, as the case may be, may refuse to approve the application on the grounds that 
 
 
 
 (a) the person who sponsored the application does not meet the requirements of the regulations respecting persons who sponsor applications for landing, or 
 
 
 
 (b) the member of the family class does not meet the requirements of this Act or the regulations, 
 
 
 
 and the person who sponsored the application shall be informed of the reasons for the refusal. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "(3) Subject to subs. (3.1), a Canadian citizen or permanent resident who has sponsored an application for landing that is refused pursuant to subs. (1) may appeal to the Appeal Division on either or both of the following grounds: 
 
 
 
 (a) on any ground of appeal that involves a question of law or fact, or mixed law and fact; and 
 
 
 
 (b) on the ground that there exist compassionate or humanitarian considerations that warrant the granting of special relief."
