  In addition to the action for infringement, and the later application for expungement, Compulife has also instituted administrative proceedings before the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations, requesting that the Director amend the articles of incorporation of "Compuoffice Software Inc." to change the name of the corporation to a name that does not include the term "COMPUOFFICE".
