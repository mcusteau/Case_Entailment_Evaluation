  Compuoffice's use of the "COMPUOFFICE" mark, in addition to other marks, is also the subject of an action for infringement, passing-off and depreciation of goodwill, filed in the Federal Court, on 17 May 1995, by Compulife. On 17 July 1995, Compuoffice filed a statement of defence and counterclaim, denying infringement and alleging infringement of the "ACROSS THE BOARD" mark by Compulife. On 28 August 1995, Compulife filed a reply and defence to the counterclaim, alleging that the "ACROSS THE BOARD" mark was invalid.
