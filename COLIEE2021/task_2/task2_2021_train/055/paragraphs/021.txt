  Counsel for the Commission suggested that the resources of the Commission were stretched thin. However, the reports which the Commission staff wrote with respect to the s. 41 proceedings in this case are lengthy and detailed, based on the submissions made by the parties. While I did not find that the reports analyzed the submissions very effectively, significant time and effort seems to have gone into their preparation. I do not think it is a satisfactory explanation for the time that has gone by to say that the resources of the Commission were stretched thin.
