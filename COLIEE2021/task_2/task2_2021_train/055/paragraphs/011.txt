  One of CPAA's responses to these concerns is to draw a distinction between the consideration it received in the 1985 agreement for past concerns respecting pay equity (proposed rates of pay, cola clause and job security clauses) and future resolution of the issue. It is pointed out that the wage gap between male and female employees remained and the CPAA should not be considered to be acting in bad faith in attempting to seek a resolution from the Commission. Certainly, the 1985 agreement provides that a job evaluation plan was yet to be implemented and, as it was to address the wage gap, CPAA is correct that the consideration received as of 1985 did not eliminate the wage gap. But, as CPAA counsel says, the agreement must be read as a whole. Reading it as a whole indicates that in addition to various benefits the employees obtained in the 1985 agreement, the parties agreed to a job evaluation plan that was to meet the requirements of the

  and to the extent they could not agree to the plan, the matter was to be arbitrated. There is no indication that the CPAA reserved to itself the right to pursue its 1982 complaint to the Commission or the right to file new complaints. If anything, the comprehensiveness of CPAA's expression of satisfaction in the 1985 agreement and its attempted withdrawal of the 1982 complaint suggests the opposite. Having regard to these considerations, my conclusion with respect to bad faith on the part of CPAA may have been different than the Commission's. Nonetheless, this was information that was before the Commission and was considered by it.
