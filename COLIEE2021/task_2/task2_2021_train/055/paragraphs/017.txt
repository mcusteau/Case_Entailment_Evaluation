  However, some further observations are in order arising out of the way in which the Commission has dealt with this matter and the amount of time that has passed since the matter was first raised. I recount certain elements of the chronology here for ease of reference. The pay equity complaint was originally filed with the Commission in 1982. In 1985, the parties agreed that it should be resolved by agreement or arbitration in accordance with the requirements of the  
 Act 
 . The Commission did not accept that settlement but by 1991, the Commission concluded it should dismiss the complaint and it did so. Nonetheless, apparently the pay equity issue had not yet been resolved between the parties.
