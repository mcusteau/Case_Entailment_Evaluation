  Timeliness was also an expressed concern of the Commission. The alternative arbitration procedure had not been invoked by either CPC or CPAA and by the time the Commission issued its October 25, 1994 decision to deal with the 1992/1993 complaint, over nine years had elapsed since the parties had agreed to resolve the pay equity issue under the 1985 agreement and arbitration. Again, while I might have resolved the matter differently, timeliness was a relevant consideration for the Commission in deciding that the arbitration alternative ought not to be exhausted. There is thus no indication of the Commission taking account of irrelevant considerations or failing to take account of relevant ones or bad faith by the Commission and there is therefore no justification for the court to interfere with this exercise of discretion by the Commission.
