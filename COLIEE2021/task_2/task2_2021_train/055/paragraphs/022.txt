  The Commission has been vested with very broad powers with respect to human rights issues. Apart from dealing with complaints brought to it, it has the power, under s. 40(3), to initiate a complaint itself. Its discretion is broad and its decisions are not readily appealable. It is generally not subject to statutory time limits. Where a tribunal has been vested with such broad powers, it has a concomitant duty to exercise those powers responsibly. The responsible exercise of such powers includes their timely exercise.
