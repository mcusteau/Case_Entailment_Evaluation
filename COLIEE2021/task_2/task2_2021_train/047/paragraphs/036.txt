  Finally, I note it was not necessary to use an alternative assessment method as the needs of the applicant were adequately addressed through modifications to the testing conditions. In her second letter, dated August 25, 2000, Dr. Collins outlined a number of steps the TSB needed to take to ensure that the testing process was fair to the applicant. The department not only followed her recommendations, but exceeded them by providing the applicant with additional time and breaks exclusive of writing time. Dr. Collins testified at the Appeal Board hearing that she was satisfied with the measures implemented by the TSB and responded with the following statement when asked by the TSB's representative, Ms. Suzanne Poulin, whether she felt the accommodations made by the TSB were reasonable (at p. 74 of the Transcript): 
 
 
 
 "Poulin: ... You've indicated that you did not do a full assessment on Mr. Tremblay. Knowing what you've heard today do you have any misgivings about the recommendations you've made to the department [PPC]? 
 
 
 
 "Collins: I believe the recommendations I provided were accurate. I do appreciate Mr. Tremblay's point of view would be to have stress eliminated; that's not a feasible scenario. Do I think that these accommodations are reasonable accommodations? I believe that they are and I think I can also honestly say that if I felt that I could not make recommendations; that I would not have made them [August 25, 2000]."
