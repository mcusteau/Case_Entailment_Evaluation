  The issue raised in this appeal requires an assessment of the Appeal Board's approach to the duty to accommodate as it relates to section 10 of the  
 PSEA 
 . This is an issue of law as to the proper interpretation of the  
 PSEA 
 . As the Appeal Board does not have a high degree of expertise in this area, the appropriate standard of review on the first issue is correctness. The rationale for this approach was set out in  
 Boucher v. Canada (Attorney General) 
  (2000), 252 N.R. 186 (F.C.A.), at para. 7: 
 
 
 
 "Turning to the first issue, that of the treatment accorded to the Knowledge factor by the Selection Board, we are of the view that this involves an issue of law as to the requirements of the merit principle and we therefore consider that the PSCAB's decision to confirm that process equally involved a conclusion of law. We are not persuaded that the PSCAB is a tribunal which should be considered to have such expertise in the interpretation of the  
 Public Service Employment Act 
  that a high degree of deference is owed to it on this issue. The Board is appointed ad hoc. We conclude in this respect that the standard of review which the Trial Division should have applied is that of correctness." 
 
 
 
 The Federal Court of Appeal has since confirmed this as the applicable standard in  
 Buttar v. Canada (Attorney General) et al. 
  (2000), 254 N.R. 368; 186 D.L.R.(4th) 101 (F.C.A.), at p. 107.
