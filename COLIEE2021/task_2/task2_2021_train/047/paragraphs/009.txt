  The TSB sought expert advice on accommodations for the applicant from Dr. Barbara Collins, a psychologist with expertise in the area of neuropsychology. Dr. Collins met with the applicant and provided two recommendations on accommodating his condition in a report dated July 28, 2000. As she seriously questioned whether modifications could be made to the test to accommodate the applicant, her first recommendation was to assess his abilities either through a trial work period or a review of his previous performance. If that option was not feasible, Dr. Collins recommended that he be given a take-home, essay-type exam to prepare, possibly incorporating an oral presentation and defence of his answers. She pointed to the applicant's past experience at the University of Ottawa, where he was allowed to complete "open-ended" take-home examinations while studying for his MBA, as a model for the TSB.
