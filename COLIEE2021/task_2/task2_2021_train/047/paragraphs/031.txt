  The determination of this issue centres on the TSB's handling of Dr. Collins' initial recommendations, which called for the use of alternative assessment methods. Alternative assessment methods of the type recommended by Dr. Collins have a place in the competitive staffing process used by the PSC as demonstrated by the PSC's own publications. Section 1:3 of the PSC's  
 Generic Standards for Selection and Assessment 
  allow for the use of alternative assessment methods in the selection process: 
 
 
 
 "[E]quitable assessment does not necessarily require the use of the same assessment methods or sources of information for all candidates. For example, in some circumstances, such as sometimes occur in an assessment of candidates with disabilities, equitable assessment will require modification of usual procedures. For more information on the assessment of persons with disabilities consult the brochure, The Assessment of Persons with Disabilities, published by the PSC. In all cases, the use of different assessment methods or sources of information for different candidates must be justified on the basis that such differential usage provides for a more accurate assessment and that the information gathered from these different methods or sources is comparable."
