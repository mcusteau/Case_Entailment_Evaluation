  The applicant was informed on October 11, 2000 that he had not passed the written examination and that the TSB was again proposing Mr. Martin Tremblay for the position. The applicant appealed the appointment pursuant to section 21 of the  
 PSEA 
 . The applicant argued that the TSB had made three errors. First, the TSB improperly disregarded Dr. Collins' initial recommendations. Second, he wrote the test under duress. He feared that if he refused to write the test, the TSB would exclude him from the competition. Third, he argued that the TSB had failed to provide him with a quiet testing area free from distractions. The applicant also sought to introduce the Krupp report. The applicant argues that the conclusions of the Krupp report support his view that individuals suffering from MS are at a significant disadvantage if given a written exam that containing true/false or multiple-choice questions. Appeal Board Chairperson Gohier accepted a summary of the Krupp report, but did not allow the full report to be introduced.
