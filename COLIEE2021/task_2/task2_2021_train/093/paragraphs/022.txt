  The Court must first establish which criteria need to be considered in identifying complicity within the context of paragraph 1(F)(a) of the  
 Convention 
 . The Federal Court of Appeal has examined the issue in three decisions:  
 Ramirez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1992] 2 F.C. 306; 135 N.R. 390 (F.C.A.),  
 Moreno and Sanchez v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1994] 1 F.C. 298; 159 N.R. 210 (F.C.A.) and  
 Sivakumar v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1994] 1 F.C. 433; 163 N.R. 197 (F.C.A.). In  
 Ramirez 
 , MacGuigan, J.A., stated as follows at paragraph 16: 
 
 
 
 "What degree of complicity, then, is required to be an accomplice or abettor? A first conclusion I come to is that mere membership in an organization which from time to time commits international offences is not normally sufficient for exclusion from refugee status. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 "It seems apparent, however, that where an organization is principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, such as a secret police activity, mere membership may by necessity involve personal and knowing participation in persecutorial acts."
