  After examining the documentary and testimonial evidence, the panel came to the following conclusions regarding the respondent's exclusion. 
 
 
 
 Regarding the murder: 
 
 
 
 (a) The description of the murder given by the applicant did not establish that the murder really did occur; and 
 
 
 
 (b) The panel is of the opinion that it was a traffic accident, that nobody died and that the police used this incident to extort money from the respondent before releasing her. 
 
 
 
 Regarding human rights abuses within the MLC: 
 
 
 
 (a) The respondent allegedly carried mail for some members of the politico-military group and attended meetings held to discuss forcing President Laurent Kabila from power; 
 
 
 
 (b) The applicant did not demonstrate that the respondent knew of the atrocities committed by the MLC and that meeting participants did not keep a tally of their victims; and 
 
 
 
 (c) With respect to the evidence that the MLC is a movement principally directed to a limited, brutal purpose, the applicant did not demonstrate that a group without the legal means to change a dictatorial regime is wrong in resorting to legitimate violence. 
 
 
 
 Regarding human rights abuses within the MPR: 
 
 
 
 (a) The applicant did not demonstrate that, as a Congolese citizen, the respondent was the only one who knew about the abuses of Mobutu's dictatorship. All Congolese had to be members of the MPR, the single party, considered to be the state party; 
 
 
 
 (b) It would seem that the respondent was aware only of general information available to the public; and 
 
 
 
 (c) In the panel's view, the respondent was not aware, as an intelligence officer or torturer would be, of the serious human rights violations committed by the Mobutu regime.
