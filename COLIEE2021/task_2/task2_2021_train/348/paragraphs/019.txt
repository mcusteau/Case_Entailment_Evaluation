Furthermore, I reject the applicant's contention that the Adjudicator erred in law by relying upon the principles set out in the
Wm. Scott
case since that decision was made in the context of a union setting. The framework of analysis for dismissal cases, as set out in the
Scott
case, is entirely consonant with the statutory mandate of an adjudicator appointed under s. 242 of the
Canada Labour Code
. The decision does not purport to be a substantive doctrine but rather consists of a three-step method of analyzing dismissal cases and a noncomprehensive list of factors that may, in any given case, be relevant in assessing the appropriateness of the discharge penatly. Simply put, the analysis set out in
Scott
provides a reasonable methodology to analyze the facts of a case and reach a determination of whether a dismissal is unjust. I am satisfied therefore that it was entirely within the scope of the Adjudicator's mandate to utilize that analysis and that it was not patently unreasonable for him to do so.
