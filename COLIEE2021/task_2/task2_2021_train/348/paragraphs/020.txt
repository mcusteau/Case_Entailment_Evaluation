I do agree with the applicant however that it should have been afforded an opportunity to make submissions with respect to the issue of backpay. Indeed, at the conclusion of the hearing before the Adjudicator, counsel for both sides requested, and the Adjudicator agreed, that if there was to be any finding with respect to backpay, counsel for the applicant would have the opportunity to address the questions of amount and the period the award should cover. That the Adjudicator agreed to this, but subsequently made findings without hearing submissions, was in all likelihood a mere oversight on his part. Nevertheless, fairness requires that his findings on that question be set aside and the matter referred back to him for submissions on that issue alone.
