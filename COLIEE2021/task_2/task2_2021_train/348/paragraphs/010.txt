The Adjudicator found that the employer's rule with respect to the consumption of alcohol was triggered by the scheduled report to duty time. He also found that Captain Kmet's action in performing certain flight-related duties in his hotel prior to his actual report to work time was sufficient to trigger the rule. He concluded that the respondent knew or should have known about the employer's rule and that Captain Kmet was therefore in breach of the rule regarding the consumption of alcohol by between fifteen minutes to half an hour by virtue of his having consumed beer at 10:30 p.m. the previous evening.
