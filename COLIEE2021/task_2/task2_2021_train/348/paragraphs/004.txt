As a result of logistical and mechanical problems with the aircraft, the flight departure from Sandspit on the evening of June 18, 1995, was substantially delayed. Initially, it appeared that the aircraft could be repaired in time to provide a return flight to Vancouver the same evening. However, at approximately 9:00 p.m., Captain Kmet was advised by the applicant's flight scheduling that the necessary repairs could not be made so as to permit the passengers to return that evening and that it would be necessary to overnight at Sandspit. At that point, the crew, having expected to depart that evening, had not found accommodations for themselves nor had they had their dinner.
