After having carefully read the decision of the Adjudicator and hearing the submissions of both parties, I am unable to conclude that any of these errors exist in the present case. Mr. Chertkow gave consideration to the substantial evidence proffered by both sides, made findings of fact supported by that evidence and then rendered the decision he was required to make under the legislation. The essence of the applicant's complaint here is with respect to the Adjudicator's assessment of the evidence before him. However, I can find no fault with his treatment of the evidence nor with his conclusion. In his view, the facts demonstrated that the dismissal penalty imposed upon Captain Kmet by the applicant was too severe under the circumstances and that it constituted an unjust dismissal. That was a finding entirely within his jurisdiction and one which was supported by the evidence before him. Accordingly, there is no basis which would warrant the court's intervention.
