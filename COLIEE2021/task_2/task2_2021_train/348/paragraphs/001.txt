Rouleau, J.
: This is an application for an order setting aside the decision of Adjudicator Mervin I. Chertkow dated May 28, 1997, wherein it was held that the respondent, Ladislav Kmet, had been unjustly dismissed by the applicant, Kelowna Flightcraft Air Charter Ltd. The Adjudicator directed the applicant to reinstate the respondent to his former position as a pilot, substituted a penalty of two months suspension instead of the dismissal and ordered the payment of lost wages.
