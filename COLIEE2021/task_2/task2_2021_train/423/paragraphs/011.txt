On September 23, 2002, the panel dismissed the motion for recusation and the extempore application made by Ms. Robert on the applicant's behalf that the hearing be suspended until this Court could rule on this application for judicial review, which had not yet been filed at the latter date. The presiding member of the panel indicated at that time that the panel would continue to sit unless a stay of proceedings was ordered by the Court.
