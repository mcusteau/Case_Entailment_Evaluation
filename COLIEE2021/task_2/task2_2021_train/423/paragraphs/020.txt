If we are now to believe the applicant, the panel would undoubtedly have no reason to exclude him from the definition of a refugee. In the notice of intervention by the Minister, dated March 20, 2003, Article 1F(a) and (f) of the
Convention
are now formally raised before the panel. Nevertheless, there is nothing in the evidence to indicate that this is what the panel intended to do. The applicant's credibility and his story of persecution are directly at issue. Accordingly, it is now for the panel to decide on the merits of the applicant's claim, and if necessary, his exclusion from the definition of a refugee, based on the applicant's credibility and all the evidence in the record.
