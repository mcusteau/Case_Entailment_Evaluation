[26]
Although the words and the tone used by the panel members at the hearing of July 17, 2002, may perhaps leave something to be desired, I do not think it can seriously be said that the members thereby lost their detachment. The presiding member cannot reasonably be blamed, once he announced the hearing was ended after a lengthy debate, for characterizing the applicant as [translation] "insolent". It is clear that at the time the applicant was trying to re-argue the merits of the panel's decision to peremptorily set the hearing at September 23, 2002.
