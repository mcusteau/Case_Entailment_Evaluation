In the case at bar, I do not see how the fact that the presiding member intervened during the hearing of November 9, 2001, to establish the diplomas and expertise of the Arab interpreter could create any fear of bias. There is also nothing wrong with telling the applicant that if he found a problem with the translation he had a duty to make this known to the panel. The applicant's other objections deal primarily with the comments by members at the hearing of July 17, 2002. Obviously, they were irritated by the fact that the hearing had to be postponed for a third time. Their irritation seems understandable to the Court, when we consider the applicant's belated decision to dismiss his former adviser, whereas she had stated publicly a year earlier that she was [Translation] "no longer" a lawyer.
