These hearings were punctuated by several motions to adjourn. Accordingly, the hearing of October 17, 2001, was postponed to November 9, 2001, at the request of the Minister's representative. The hearing of February 11, 2002, had to be cancelled because the applicant was not present (although his former adviser, Ms. Lydia Ntap, was present). The hearing was then postponed to June 6, 2002. In the meantime, on May 28, 2002, the applicant dismissed his former adviser. The hearing of June 6, 2002, had to be cancelled as the applicant could not find new counsel.
