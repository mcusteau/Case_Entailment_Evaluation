  The argument of the Applicant appears to be that, no matter how many days were unsubstantiated, the evidence shows that his ties to Canada are substantial. On these facts, the Applicant asserts that, even without an accurate assessment of the number of days of physical presence, the Judge should have conducted a  
 Re Koo 
  analysis. That, in my view, cannot be the law. The importance of citizenship and the application of common sense dictate that a person seeking citizenship in Canada must come with a credible record of his time spent in Canada. Thus, any starting point for a residency analysis - whether under  
 Re Koo 
  or  
 Re Pourghasemi 
  - must be the total number of days of physical presence, supported by credible evidence.
