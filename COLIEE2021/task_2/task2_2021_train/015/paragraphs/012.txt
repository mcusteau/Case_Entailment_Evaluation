  The Applicant submits that the Citizenship Judge erred by failing to make a specific determination of how many days the Applicant was actually physically present in Canada. In the absence of such a determination, the Applicant argues, the Judge cannot reasonably have concluded that the residency requirement of s. 5(1)(c) was not met. This argument, in my view, is fatally flawed. The burden is on the Applicant - not on the Citizenship Judge - to establish, with clear and compelling evidence, the number of days of residence. In this case, the Applicant failed to provide consistent and credible evidence with respect to his absences from Canada.
