  The Commission may decide, even without investigating the complaint, to send it directly to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal. Section 49 provides that at any stage after the filing of a complaint the Commission may request the Chairperson of the Tribunal to institute an inquiry if the Commission is satisfied "having regard to all the circumstances of the complaint" that "an inquiry is warranted". On receipt of such a request the Chair "shall institute an inquiry". The Commission has rarely, if ever, invoked this power. Counsel for the parties could not recall a single case in which a complaint was referred to the Tribunal without prior investigation. Indeed, judicial consideration of the  
 Act 
  has been limited to instances in which the Commission has decided, after investigation, to either dismiss the complaint or to refer it to the Tribunal.
