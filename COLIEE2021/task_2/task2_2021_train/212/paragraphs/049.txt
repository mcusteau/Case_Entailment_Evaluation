  I do not think this is a case in which costs should be granted. The Commission is not party to these proceedings. Dr. Grover could hardly have allowed the NRC's application to be heard on an ex parte basis. It was right that he should defend his interests. It should also be borne in mind that the decision under review is not the decision he sought. He would have preferred the Commission to leave matters in abeyance.
