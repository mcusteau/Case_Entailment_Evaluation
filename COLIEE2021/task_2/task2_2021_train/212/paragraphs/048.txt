  For these reasons, I have decided that judicial review should be granted. Insufficient reasons were given to support the Commission's decision with respect to complaints H30947 and H32637. As its investigation into complaint H47999 was incomplete, it could not have been satisfied, on proper grounds, that a referral to the Tribunal was warranted and that it should be joined to the other two complaints.
