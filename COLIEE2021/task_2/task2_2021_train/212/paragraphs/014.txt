  In 2002 Dr. Grover took action against the NRC in the Ontario Superior Court, an action in which he cites violation of his  
 Canadian Charter 
  rights. This action is broader in scope than the three complaints currently before me by way of judicial review, as he alleges continued discrimination even following his fourth complaint. He has told the Commission of his frustration in that discrimination is ongoing despite the constant redress he has sought through it.
