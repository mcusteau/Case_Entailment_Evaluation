 [30] 
  Having decided to dismiss complaints H32471 and H32637, why then did the Commission subsequently decide to refer them to the Tribunal: 
 
 
 
 1. Was it concerned that there was still an aura of partiality, notwithstanding that Dr. Vanier was interviewed as directed by Heneghan, J.? 
 
 
 
 2. Did it take a fresh look at the entire matter and change its mind? 
 
 
 
 3. Did it think it could not assess Dr. Vanier's credibility because he was found wanting once before by the Tribunal?  
 
 
 
 4. Was this an appropriate way to deal with Dr. Grover's request that proceedings be stayed pending the outcome of the Ontario Superior Court action? 
 
 
 
 5. Was it concerned that the tardiness alleged by Dr. Grover, and its inquisitorial approach to complaints, might subject it to criticism by a common law court armed with an adversarial process? 
 
 
 
 6. Since it did not interview witnesses it intended to interview, how can it say that complaint H47999 is inextricably linked with the others?
