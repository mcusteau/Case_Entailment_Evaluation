 [29] 
  The report concluded with this recommendation: 
 
 
 
 "31. It is recommended, pursuant to subsection 49 of the  
 Canadian Human Rights Act 
 , that the Commission request the appointment of a Human Rights Tribunal to inquire into complaints H32471, H32637 and H47999, because: 
 
 
 
 - these 3 complaints are inextricably linked with the complaint decided upon by the CHRT in 1992 and 1994 and with one another; and 
 
 
 
 - the CHRT, in 1992 and 1994, has already made findings of fact on the witnesses' credibility and on some of the issues raised by the complainant in the 3 complaints at issue."
