  In  
 Slattery 
 , supra, at 28, Nadon, J., set up a high threshold for judicial review of Commission decisions on the ground of thoroughness: 
 
 
 
 "The fact that the investigator did not interview each and every witness that the applicant would have liked her to and the fact that the conclusion reached by the investigator did not address each and every alleged incident of discrimination are not in and of themselves fatal as well. This is particularly the case where the applicant has the opportunity to fill in gaps left by the investigator in subsequent submissions of her own. In the absence of guiding regulations, the investigators, much like the CHRC, must be master of its own procedure, and judicial review of an allegedly deficient investigation should only be warranted where the investigation is clearly deficient."
