  The remaining plea of the applicant is that the Commission did not follow up on the investigator's recommendation that the matter be sent to conciliation. In counsel's view, the Commission was under a burden to state why the recommendation was not accepted. With respect, I fail to see any grounds to intervene on that basis. I believe that jurisprudence has firmly established that the Commission's function at that stage of its jurisdiction is purely discretionary and that many of the orthodox grounds for judicial review do not apply to it. The one condition which the Commission must respect is that of conducting the proceedings with fairness. I see no deviation in that duty on the strength of the record before me. The investigator's report was submitted to the applicant and she responded to it.
