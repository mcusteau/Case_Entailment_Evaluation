  After the complaint was initiated, on September 28, 1990, the applicant commenced action number 43020/90, an action for wrongful (constructive) dismissal, in the Ontario Court (General Division) against the Mint et al. That action proceeded to trial, where it was dismissed on October 1, 1992 by Chadwick, J. [see footnote 4]. In his judgment, Chadwick, J., commented that, in his opinion, the applicant's human rights complaints were initiated with the object of furthering a wrongful dismissal complaint after attempts to obtain a generous severance package had failed.
