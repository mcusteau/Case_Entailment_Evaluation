  The standard of review of decisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board dealing with credibility and fact-driven decisions is patent unreasonableness: Mahjoub v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 173 at para. 42. See also Aguebor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 732 (F.C.A.) at para. 4, where the Court states that the Refugee Division, as a specialized tribunal, has complete jurisdiction to determine the plausibility of testimony: "[W]ho is in a better position than the Refugee Division to gauge the credibility of an account and to draw the necessary inferences?"
