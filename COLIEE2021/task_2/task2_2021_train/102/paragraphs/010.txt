  The Applicant submits that the Board ignored documentary evidence that supported his claim that hardships often befall failed refugee claimants upon their return to India, especially those who are Sikh. The Applicant pointed to documentary evidence that showed that sometimes Sikhs were the victims of police misconduct while in custody, and subjected to inhumane methods of interrogation, including torture. The Applicant also provided information about Sikh terrorists based in Canada, among other places, which he alleged would cause the Indian authorities to scrutinize him even more closely upon his return. The Applicant submits that the Board was obligated to deal with this evidence.
