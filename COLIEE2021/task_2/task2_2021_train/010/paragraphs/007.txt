  The proposed 240 kilovolt (kV) transmission line is intended to address the need for additional wind power generation in southwest Alberta. The project involves the construction of a new substation, the expansion of two existing substations and the construction of over 80 km of double-circuit 240 kV transmission line. The planned right-of-way would cross federal land, including 26 kilometres of the Piikani Reserve, another reserve, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's property at its Lethbridge laboratory, privately owned land and unoccupied Alberta Crown land.
