  Mr. Provost claims never to have seen this memorandum of understanding, that there was a split in the Band Council and that there had been some secret meetings to which he had not been invited. Mr. Green agrees that there was some dysfunction but says that only occurred later on in that Band Council's term when one councillor died and another resigned, making it difficult to obtain the required quorum of seven. Mr. Hodgkinson, who only came on board in 2006, was also of the view that the Council was dysfunctional until a new chief and slate of councillors were elected in 2007. Be that as it may, Mr. Provost admitted in cross-examination that contrary to his first affidavits, in which he said that the discussions during his term in office were preliminary in nature, they were more detailed than that. Indeed the discussions at that point were between AltaLink and Piikani Energy Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Piikani Investment Corporation, which in turn was owned by the band. Mr. Provost was a director of the Piikani Utilities Corporation, but appears to have paid no attention to what was going on. He said "things slip by me."
