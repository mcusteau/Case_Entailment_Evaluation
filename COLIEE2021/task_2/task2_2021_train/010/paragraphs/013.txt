  AltaLink's negotiations with the Chief and the Band Council were well underway in 2004 when a memorandum of understanding, which contemplated a joint venture with respect to a new transmission line on Piikani land, was executed. It is noteworthy that at that time Mr. Provost was one of the 12 band councillors. He had been elected in early 2003 and remained in office until January 2007.
