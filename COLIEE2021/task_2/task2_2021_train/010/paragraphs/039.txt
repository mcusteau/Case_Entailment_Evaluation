  Mr. Provost has standing to assert the specific allegations in his applications. He asserts that there was a duty to consult. Obviously if there were such a duty, he would have been "directly affected" by any failure do so. It is important to note that Mr. Provost does not assert that the decision of the Band Council to support the project and the Minister's decision to issue the permit were unreasonable. It is beyond the scope of these judicial reviews to comment as to whether he would have standing were he to have made such allegations.
