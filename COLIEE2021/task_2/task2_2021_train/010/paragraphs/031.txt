 b) The nature of the statutory scheme and the terms of the statute pursuant to which the body operates; 
 
 
 
 c) The importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected; 
 
 
 
 d) The legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision; and 
 
 
 
 e) The choice of procedure made by the agency itself.
