 [61] 
  As a result, there is no need to consider whether the impugned provisions of the  
 Election Act 
  are justified under section 1 of the  
 Charter 
 . The education provisions of the  
 Election Act 
  do not discriminate on the basis of race or age, and the level of education is not an analogous ground to either race or age. There is, therefore, no infringement of subsection 15(1) of the  
 Charter 
 .
