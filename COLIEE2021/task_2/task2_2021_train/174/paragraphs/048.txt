  I agree with the Respondents that the plain meaning of the education provisions in the  
 Election Act 
 , and in particular the use of the word "equivalency", indicate that the intention of the provisions is to ensure that a candidate has either a Grade 12 education, a level of education that is of the same level as a Grade 12 education, or a level of education that is higher than a Grade 12 education. Mr. Taypotat clearly does not have a diploma showing that he has a Grade 12 education, although he managed to obtain a Grade 10 level in a GED test. As for the honourary diploma that he presented to the Elections Officer, it appears that it was based on Mr. Taypotat's commitment to his community and the experience that he had in business and government services for his community. While this is most certainly commendable, it is clearly not the equivalent of formal education. That such a diploma is not in keeping with the spirit of the  
 Election Act 
  is further evidenced by the legislative history of that Act. As previously mentioned, the First Nation initially included "experience" as an alternative to formal educational requirements, but subsequently removed "experience" as an eligibility criteria for the position of Chief of the First Nation. This change suggests that "experience" alone, or any recognition thereof, does not meet the requirements of the education provisions.
