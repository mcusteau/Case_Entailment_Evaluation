  Recognizing that there was no requirement that a ratification process of a band custom election system occur or be initiated in any specific way, the Court noted that slightly more than 50% of the band members participated in the ratification vote and that 83% of the eligible voters who participated, voted in favour of the band custom election system. Given that the respondents and their supporters refused to participate in the referendum process, the Court was of the view that the turnout was remarkably high and that the result shows a clear endorsement of the new regime as a custom of the Nekaneet First Nation (at para 61).
