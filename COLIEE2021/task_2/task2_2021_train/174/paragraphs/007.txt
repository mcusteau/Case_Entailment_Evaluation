 [7] 
  The Membership Committee, established pursuant to the  
 Kahkewistahaw First Nation Membership Code 
 , was given the task of developing a draft  
 Election Act 
  and advancing the referendum process to determine the desire of the members of the First Nation in regard to the proposed  
 Election Act 
 . The Respondents submit that the Membership Committee, charged with developing the  
 Election Act 
 , met at least 25 times, prepared at least 17 drafts and consulted with the band council and First Nation members throughout. The Applicant submits that the  
 Election Act 
  was discussed at multiple meetings of the Elders of Kahkewistahaw, was rejected by that group in 2007 and has never been accepted since that time. The Respondents dispute that claim, and submit that in any event there was no requirement that the Elders accept the  
 Election Act 
  in order for it to be validly enacted.
