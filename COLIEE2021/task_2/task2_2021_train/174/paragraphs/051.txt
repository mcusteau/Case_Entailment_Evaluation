  In  
 Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 SCR 817, the Supreme Court determined that an oral hearing is not always necessary to ensure a fair hearing and consideration of the issues involved. The Court added that the duty of fairness is flexible and variable and will depend on the context of the particular statute and the rights affected. The importance of the decision to the individual affected is no doubt a factor to be considered. However, the other factors identified by the Court do not favour the Applicant. First, the process provided for and the nature of the decision-making body (i.e. the Elections Officer) does not resemble judicial decision-making. Second, there is no appeal procedure although judicial review is always available. Third, the Applicant could not have a legitimate expectation that he would be entitled to a hearing. Fourth, the  
 Election Act 
  does not prescribe any specific procedure and leaves it to the Elections Officer, who has expertise in that matter. In light of these factors, I fail to see how the duty to act fairly could be interpreted as requiring an oral hearing, before the Elections Officer can determine the eligibility of a candidate.
