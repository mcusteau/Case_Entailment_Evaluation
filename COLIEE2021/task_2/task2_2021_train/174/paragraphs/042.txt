 [42] 
  The Applicant also submitted that a number of violations to the Community Ratification Voting Guidelines (Applicant's Record, vol. I, p. 171) occurred, particularly with respect to the January 22, 2010 Continuation Vote. These irregularities are minor in nature and have not been shown to have affected the results of either the Second or Continuation Vote. As the Court indicated in  
 Nekaneet First Nation 
 ,  
 supra 
 , it is not always necessary to strictly construe the provisions of an election code, and a vote will generally not be determined invalid as a result of irregularities, unless such irregularities would have materially affected the results of the vote. There is no evidence before me that the alleged violations reach that threshold.
