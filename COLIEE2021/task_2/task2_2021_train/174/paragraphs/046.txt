 [46] 
  The appropriate standard of review on the substantive issue raised by the Applicant is that of reasonableness. The Elections Officer derived her authority from the  
 Election Act 
 , and was interpreting her "home statute" when deciding whether the honourary certificate is equivalent to an education level of Grade 12. In  
 Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v Alberta Teachers' Association 
 , 2011 SCC 61, [2011] 3 SCR 654, the majority stated that the appropriate standard of review will be correctness only where the nature of the question of statutory interpretation is "not only ...of central importance to the legal system but also outside the adjudicator's specialized area of expertise" (at para 46). The majority summarized recent case law at paragraph 30 and noted that the appropriate standard will ordinarily be reasonableness where the decision-makers are interpreting their home statute. The inclusion of a strong privative clause in the  
 Election Act 
  is an additional strong indicator that deference is owed to the decision-maker.
