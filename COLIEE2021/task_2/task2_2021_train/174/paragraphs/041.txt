  As for the suggestion that the low turnout rate was evidence of dissent rather than acquiescence, the Applicant has not provided any evidence to that effect. It would appear, instead, that the participation levels of the Second and Continuation Vote simply show the apathy of the voters. This is borne out by the historical rates of voter participation, which indicate that the turnout for the votes on the  
 Election Act 
  were actually above normal. In 2001, 2007 and 2009, respectively 44%, 40% and 43% of the eligible voters of the First Nation voted in the election for the position of Chief. While the total number of eligible voters in 1999, 2003 and 2005 are not available, the number of First Nation members who did vote for the position of Chief in those years indicate a relatively stable level of member participation in First Nation elections, as is the case for many municipal elections throughout the country.
