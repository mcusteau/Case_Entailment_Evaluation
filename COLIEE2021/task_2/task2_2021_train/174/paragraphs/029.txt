  A number of cases indicate that a majority of First Nation members need not vote in favour of adopting a band custom election code, and that there is no legal requirement that the majority consensus be ascertained in any particular way. Conversely, the fact that a change was supported by a simple majority vote of electors is not necessarily sufficient to change an established custom. As Justice Reed stated in

 The question that remains is whether "broad general consensus" equates to a "majority decision of the Band members attending a general meeting of the Band convened with notice". In my view, it may do so, or it may not, depending upon a number of factors. If for example, the general meeting was held in a location or at a time when it was difficult for a number of members to attend, and there was no provision for proxy voting, it may not meet the broad consensus test. If the notice was not adequate in not providing sufficient detail of what was proposed, or was not given sufficiently in advance of the meeting to allow people a realistic opportunity to attend then it would not be.
