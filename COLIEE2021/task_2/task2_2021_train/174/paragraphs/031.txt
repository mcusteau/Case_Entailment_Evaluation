  In  
 Lac des Mille Lacs First Nation v Champan 
 , [1998] FCJ no 752, 149 FTR 227, the Court held that an election code adopted as a result of a vote in which 86 of 300 eligible voters voted, and only 73 voted in favour, constituted a broad consensus. In the unique circumstances of that First Nation, the location of only about 130 voters was known and typically only 45 voters participated in the electoral process. Against this history of general non-participation, the fact that 86 voters voted was actually significant.
