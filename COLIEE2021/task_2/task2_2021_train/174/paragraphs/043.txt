  Finally, the Applicant suggests that the petition signed by 340 First Nation members discloses a lack of consensus for the educational requirements of the  
 Election Act 
 . As was the case in  
 Nekaneet 
 ,  
 supra 
 , the Applicant has provided no evidence that would allow this Court to gauge the significance or legitimacy of the petition as an indicator of a consensus. Moreover, there seems to be only 72 members who can credibly be considered to have opposed the  
 Election Act 
  in the petition. According to the affidavit sworn by Vera Wasacase, Councillor for the First Nation and Chairperson for the Membership Committee, it would appear that of the 340 persons who signed the petition, 12 of them were under the age of 18 years as of May 13, 2011 (the date of the Election), 28 others were either under the age of 18 years at the time of the Second Vote and the Continuation Vote or were not members of the First Nation, and 105 of them did not even bother to vote in either the Second Vote or the Continuation Vote. This leaves 195 First Nation members on the petition who did vote in the Second Vote or the Continuation Vote and who were of the age of 18 at the time of the Second Vote, the Continuation Vote and the Election. Since 72 First Nation members in total voted "no" in the Second Vote and Continuation Vote, this means that 123 First Nation members must have voted "yes" in the Second Vote or in the Continuation Vote, and later signed the petition. In these circumstances, it is difficult to give much weight to the petition.
