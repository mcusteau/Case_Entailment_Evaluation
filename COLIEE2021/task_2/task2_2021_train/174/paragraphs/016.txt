  On April 13, 2011, a nomination meeting was conducted by the Elections Officer. At the meeting, the Applicant was nominated to run for Chief in the election, but the Elections Officer rejected the nomination based on his ineligibility. As Sheldon Taypotat was the only remaining candidate who possessed the qualifications under the  
 Election Act 
 , there was no election held for the position of Chief and he was elected by acclamation to that position.
