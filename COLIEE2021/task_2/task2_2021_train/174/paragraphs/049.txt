  While the Court acknowledges Mr. Taypotat's predicament and understands that obtaining a Grade 12 education was obviously more difficult for someone who attended residential school, this does not make the Elections Officer's decision unreasonable. She could most certainly come to the decision that Mr. Taypotat did not qualify as a candidate, based on her own interpretation of paragraphs 9.03(c) and 10.01(d) of the  
 Election Act 
  and on the legal opinion that was provided to her.
