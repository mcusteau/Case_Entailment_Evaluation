 [57] 
  In  
 Law v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 1 SCR 497, [1999] SCJ no 12, the Supreme Court added that four contextual factors can be looked at to determine whether legislation is discriminatory. One of those factors, probably the most compelling according to the Court, is pre-existing disadvantage, vulnerability, stereotyping, or prejudice experienced by the individual or group. As the Court stated (at para 64): 
 
 
 
 One consideration which the Court has frequently referred to with respect to the issue of pre-existing disadvantage is the role of stereotypes. A stereotype may be described as a misconception whereby a person or, more often, a group is unfairly portrayed as possessing undesirable traits, or traits which the group, or at least some of its members, do not possess. In my view, probably the most prevalent reason that a given legislative provision may be found to infringe s. 15(1) is that it reflects and reinforces existing inaccurate understandings of the merits, capabilities and worth of a particular person or group within Canadian society, resulting in further stigmatization of that person or the members of the group or otherwise in their unfair treatment. This view accords with the emphasis placed by this Court ever since Andrews, supra, upon the role of s. 15(1) in overcoming prejudicial stereotypes in society.
