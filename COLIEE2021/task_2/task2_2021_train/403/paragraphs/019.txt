I refused to allow the applicant's application to file evidence that was not before the VRAB. To have allowed the application would cause a serious prejudice to the respondent. Furthermore, in a judicial review application such as the present one, I must decide if the decision is patently unreasonable. I could not do so if I considered evidence that was not before the decision-maker.
