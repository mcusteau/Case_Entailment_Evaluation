R.B. Irving's letter, dated June 19, 1997, is also of questionable value. In his letter, Irving states that although he was part of the Highway Patrol Unit with the applicant, he was not on duty at the time of the accident. Irving states:
"I remember that the police car was totalled and there were various injuries to the members. I believe that as well as suffering an injury to his leg, Merv also got a good bump to the head. I do not recall the exact date of this incident but have been informed that the incident occurred on the 27 of April 1968." [see footnote 12]
