The applicant argues that there was no evidence before the panel that he suffered from any pre-existing neck or back injury at the time of his enlistment with the RCMP in 1964. There was no evidence contradicting his contention that he had to undergo gym and equitation training. The applicant contends that the absence of a report of any injuries does not amount to contradictory evidence, and therefore the presumption found in subsection 21(3) of the
Pension Act
and section 39 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
should apply.
