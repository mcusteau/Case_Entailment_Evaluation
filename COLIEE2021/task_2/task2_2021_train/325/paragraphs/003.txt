In support of the motion for recusal is the affidavit of Roger Rodrigues, a Toronto solicitor, who states that "It is common and widespread knowledge that Mr. Justice Dubé had a long and visible profile as a federal politician and federal Cabinet Minister prior to his appointment to the Federal Court by Pierre Trudeau.". The affidavit goes on to state that Prime Minister Jean Chrétien is an ex-Cabinet colleague, and in annex is a copy of my memoirs,
Du banc D'école au banc fédéral
. At page 220 of that book there is one reference to Jean Chrétien which reads as follows:
"Il a été remplacé par Jean Chrétien, un bon ami que tout le monde connaît et que je n'ai pas à présenter."
Paragraphs 7 and 8 of Mr. Rodrigues' affidavit read as follows:
"7. It is alarming, beyond belief, given the transparent nature of the relief sought, inter alia, a conversion into a trial as well as disclosure of Cabinet documents, as well as the issue of Cabinet privilege, and that subpoenas against cabinet Ministers as well as Mr. Chretien, may be sought, with respect to the
MAI
, that Mr. Justice Dubé would even make a direction on the matter.
"8. It is clear beyond argument that, as a member of the bar, any involvement by Mr. Justice Dubé with this application would flauntingly invite the administration of justice into complete disrepute and render impotent any semblance of a pretence of the constitutional right to an independent judiciary in Canada."
