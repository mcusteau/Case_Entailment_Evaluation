Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 131 F.T.R. 52 ("Mohammad")he Court set aside the visa officer's decision for his failure to disclose, with reasons, his refusal to assess the applicant's intended occupation as Laundry Machine Mechanic. The Court also noted his failure to question the applicant concerning the occupation of Mechanical Engineering Technician, the one chosen by the visa officer himself for his decision.
