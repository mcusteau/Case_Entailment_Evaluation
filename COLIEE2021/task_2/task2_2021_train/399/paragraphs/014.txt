Furthermore, the Court in Du v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2001), 15 Imm. L.R. (3d) 64 (F.C.T.D.), states:
... I find the principles set out in this jurisprudence persuasive and adopt them. It follows that while the CAIPS notes are admissible as part of the record, evidencing the reasons for the decision under review, the CAIPS notes do not prove the underlying facts which they record and on which they rely.
Moreover, in this case the CAIPS notes were certainly not made contemporaneously with the interview they purport to record. Any inference of reliability must depend upon the promptness with which the notes are entered into the CAIPS system. The unexplained delay in entering the notes and the absence of any evidence as to the provenance of the precise content of the notes leads me to conclude that the notes here cannot be viewed to be reliable.
It follows that I have not been persuaded that the notes satisfy the requirements of necessity and reliability under the principled approach to hearsay evidence, nor that they can be considered to be a declaration made during the course of duty, nor that an evidentiary basis has been provided to establish that the notes meet the requirements of admissibility for business records.
