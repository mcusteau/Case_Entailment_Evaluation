In Reddy, supra, Reed J. warned against relying on ex post facto affidavits unsupported by documentation which has been prepared contemporaneously with the assessment. She also noted that "[a]t the same time ... I cannot conclude that the text of the decision letter demonstrates that the visa officer did not address his mind to the real issue" (at paragraph 5). In the case at bar, as pointed out previously, I find that there was a failure to prepare adequate CAIPS notes by the visa officer, which normally constitute the contemporaneous documentation prepared at the assessment. Furthermore, in reading the CAIPS notes and the decision letter, it appears that the visa officer did not go beyond the applicant's job of surveyor of ships and direct a specific line of questions to his actual work experience in the air conditioning field, broken down into its constituent elements for the purpose of making an appropriate assessment of his adaptability or transferability to the intended occupation of Foreman, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Mechanic.
