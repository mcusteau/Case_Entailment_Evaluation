Since the applicant lacked the required 70 points under the Regulations, the visa officer refused to grant him a visa. The visa officer also found that the applicant had not demonstrated that he had at least one year of full-time work experience as a Marine Engineer, and awarded him no points for experience. Similarly, she found that the applicant had not performed a substantial number of duties of a Marine Engineer, as described in the NOC, and awarded him no points under the occupational factor. The visa officer further found that the applicant did not have experience performing some or a substantial number of the main duties of a Foreman, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Mechanic. Because subsections 11(1) and (2) of the Regulations require at least one point under each of the experience and occupational factors, the application was automatically refused.
