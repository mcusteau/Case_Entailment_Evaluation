The applicant now seeks judicial review of this decision on the following grounds. The applicant states that the visa officer failed to provide reasons for allotting no units of experience under the occupation of Foreman, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Mechanic. The applicant argues that the visa officer did not go beyond his job title of surveyor of ships and failed to determine the active duties performed by him. The applicant contends that he fulfilled the following duties: maintenance of M/E, auxiliaries, steering system, air conditioning mechanical blowers, refrigeration plant, all cranes, winches, windless, mooring winehes [sic], cargo oil pumps, boilers, and electrical and hydraulic systems pertaining thereto. Those are relevant to the intended occupation of Foreman, Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Mechanic. Therefore, the applicant submits that an interview should have at least been granted before denying his application for permanent residence in Canada.
