For these reasons, this application for judicial review will be allowed, the decision under review will be set aside, and the applicant's application for permanent residence in Canada will be referred back to the respondent for re-determination in accordance with the law by a different visa officer. Concerning the request for party party costs made by the applicant, Rule 22 of the Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules, SOR/93-22, as amended, provides that "[n]o costs shall be awarded to or payable by any party in respect of an application for leave, an application for judicial review or an appeal under these Rules unless the Court, for special reasons, so orders." In the case at bar, I am not satisfied that there are special reasons which would justify the award of costs on a party party basis. Therefore, I will reject the request for costs made by the applicant. As indicated at the conclusion of the oral hearing, the parties may file submissions in writing regarding any question of serious general importance which ought to be certified for appeal. The Court requests such submissions within 10 days, and reply within seven days thereafter. An order will issue following the consideration of any such submissions.
