Counsel for the respondent further submits that Mohammad, supra, can be distinguished on the basis that this case was with respect to a breach to the duty of fairness and that no specific statement was made by the Court regarding the "reliance" on a visa officer's affidavit. This characterization appears improper. First, the use the Court will make of a visa officer's affidavit depends on the factors developed in the case law that I have already discussed (see paragraphs 13 to 15). Second, there is indeed an alleged breach of procedural fairness in the present case considering the reproach made that at least an interview should have been held.
