While Gulf States and Deco are not parties to the action, it appears from the discovery that they manufactured plates at the behest of the defendant. Some of those plates are of the alleged infringing type and found their way into Canada as a result of being sold by the defendant to Coutts. The Associate Senior Prothonotary did not give reasons for his decisions. This is not a criticism - it would be impractical to do so when many questions are in dispute. This means, however, that the principle that he applied in reaching his decisions must be a matter of conjecture for a reviewing judge. It appears that his decision was based on the assumption that since Gulf States and Deco are not presently parties to the litigation and the manufacturing they did took place in the United States, not Canada, the questions did not come within Federal Court Rule 458, as being relevant to any unadmitted allegation of fact.
