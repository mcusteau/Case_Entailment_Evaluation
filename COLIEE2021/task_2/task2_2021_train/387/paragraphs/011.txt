Counsel for the defendant argues that many of the questions, in any event, are too broad. It is argued, for example, that they are not limited to the time period relevant to this litigation (e.g., Q. 191), not restricted to plates (e.g., Q. 1074-75), and not restricted to products manufactured by Hallmark for Coutts (e.g., Q. 199). It is easy for counsel when asking questions on discovery to slip into a shorthand way of asking a question, which in fairness, should be read by reference to other, usually preceding, questions that were asked, unless counsel expressly indicates otherwise. If this latitude of interpretation is not allowed, the door is opened for needless refusals to answer and motions to compel answers. On the basis that the context within which the questions were asked provide the appropriate limitations thereon, I do not find the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision to be clearly wrong, in the sense that it was based on a wrong principle or upon a misapprehension of the facts.
