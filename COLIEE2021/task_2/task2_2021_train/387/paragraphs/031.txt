As I understand counsel's explanation of the Associate Senior Prothonotary's decision, it is that the order requested was refused because there was no proper evidence before the Associate Senior Prothonotary demonstrating that the United States proceeding existed and was parallel to the present proceeding, nor was there evidence demonstrating that the documentation that was sought was relevant to the present proceeding. It was not argued that this decision by the Associate Senior Prothonotary was in error. Counsel for the plaintiff sought to file with the court an affidavit to supply the missing evidence. He took the position that an appeal of a prothonotary's decision to a judge is a proceeding de novo and, therefore, I was entitled to accept this evidence and render the decision the Associate Senior Prothonotary would have made had he had that evidence before him.
