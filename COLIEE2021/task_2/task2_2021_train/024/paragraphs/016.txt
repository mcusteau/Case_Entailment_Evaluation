 [16] 
  With respect to conflict proceedings Justice Snider of this Court in  
 Laboratoires Servier v. Apotex Inc. 
  (2008), 67 CPR (4th) 241, 2008 FC 825 at paragraphs 399 to 403 wrote that conflict proceedings are directed to issues of priority of inventorship, and later proceedings dealing with a patent issued after the resolution of the conflict proceedings may deal with other issues. This does not mean, however, that in the course of conflict proceedings, the parties to those proceeding cannot raise issues as to why an opposite party should not get a patent in the first place. For instance, section 43(4) of the pre-October 1, 1989  
 Patent Act 
  permits a party to a conflict to submit prior art which it may allege anticipates a claim or claims in conflict.
