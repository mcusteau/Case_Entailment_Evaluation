  Justice Shore expressed a contrary opinion in  
 Janssen-Ortho Inc. v. Apotex Inc. 
  2008 FC 744 at paragraph 201: 
 
 
 
 201 It is clear that there is no express duty of candour contained in the Patent Act or the Patent Rules and that the word "candour" does not even appear in this legislation. While a duty of candour and good faith exists during the prosecution of patent applications in the United States Patent Office, a similar duty does not exist in Canada. The facts alleged by Apotex in its NOA are addressed by subsection 30(1) of the Patent Act and paragraphs 40(l)(a), 40(1)(c) and section 45 of the Patent Rules. There is no basis in Canadian law for the separate allegation of breach of candour put forth by Apotex. As the Federal Court of Appeal stated in Flexi-Coil Ltd. v. Bourgault Industries Ltd., the disclosure required "can only be... that which the statute, the rules and the jurisprudence already require. Furthermore, even if the duty of disclosure had been extended as suggested by counsel, the impact of the extension would be felt not at the level of the validity of the patent but at the level of the remedies where equitable considerations might come into play." (Stewart Affidavit paras. 68-70, AR v. 29 Tab 42 p. 9081; Flexi-Coil Ltd. v. Bourgault Industries Ltd. (1999), 237 N.R. 74, 86 C.P.R. (3d) 221 at 231-232 (FCA), aff'ing (1998), 80 CPR (3d) 1, 78 A.C.W.S. (3d) 373 (F.C.T.D.).)
