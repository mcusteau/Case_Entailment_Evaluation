 Hughes, J. 
 : These Reasons for Order and Order deal with motions by each of Monsanto Technology LLC and Mycogen Plant Science, Inc. to amend their pleadings. In particular Monsanto seeks to amend its Reply and Defence to Counterclaim in action T-1524-08 to add certain paragraphs relating to what I will call the Jansens Affidavit. Mycogen seeks to amend its Statement of Claim in T-1524-08 also to address the Jansens Affidavit. For the reasons that follow I will order that, with some exceptions, Monsanto's proposed amendments will be allowed. Mycogen's proposed amendments will be allowed. Costs will be in the cause.
