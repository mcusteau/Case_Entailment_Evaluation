  These three actions have been ordered to proceed together using a combined style of cause. They will be heard together with a target trial date late next year. All of these actions arise out of what is known as conflict proceedings in the Canadian Patent Office. The Canadian  
 Patent Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. P-4 underwent substantial amendments effective October 1, 1989, wherein applications for patents filed before that date are treated in a significantly different manner than those filed after that date. One of the most significant amendments was a change from "first to invent" under the pre-October 1, 1989 regime to a "first to file" regime after that date. The first to invent regime is in many respects similar to that which prevailed and to some extent still prevails in the United States, whereas the first to file regime resembles a regime followed in Europe and many other countries.
