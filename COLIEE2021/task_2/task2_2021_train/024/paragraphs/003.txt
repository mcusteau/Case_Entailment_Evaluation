  Conflict proceedings such as these actions are governed by section 43 of the pre-October 1, 1989  
 Patent Act 
  and were the subject of a special Rule, Rule 701, in this Court. That Rule no longer exists as conflict actions are now rare. I am advised that very few, perhaps a dozen or two, applications for a patent filed in the Canadian Patent Office before October 1, 1989, still are in processing in the Patent Office. Those applications and the contents of the prosecution files, unlike the post October 1, 1989 applications, are not open to the public. Entitlement to a patent, where it appears to the Patent Office that two or more patent applications are directed to the same subject matter (something that occurs more often than one might think) are determined by the Commissioner of Patents by reviewing affidavits submitted by the competing parties directed to the date or the dates when the invention was made by their inventors. Parties who are unsatisfied with that determination may proceed to request a new determination by way of an action filed in this Court. These three actions are examples in which there was a determination by the Commissioner as to who was the first to invent the subject matter of certain claims, the dissatisfied parties seek a re-determination in this Court.
