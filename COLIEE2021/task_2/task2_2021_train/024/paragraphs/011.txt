  All Counsel, including Bayer's Counsel, accept that, as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Hunt v. Casey Canada Inc. 
 , [1990] S.C.R. 959 at 980, on a motion such as these the facts as set out in the proposed amendments are to be taken as proved and that, in order to succeed, it must be shown by the party resisting the amendment that it is plain and obvious that the amendment sought cannot succeed. To that I would add that the Supreme Court also said that the length and complexity of the issues and the novelty of what is pleaded should not be a bar. I repeat what Wilson J. for the Court wrote at page 980: 
 
 
 
 Thus, the test in Canada governing the application of provisions like Rule 19(24)(a) of the British Columbia Rules of Court is the same as the one that governs an application under R.S.C. O. 18, r. 19: assuming that the facts as stated in the statement of claim can be proved, is it "plain and obvious" that the plaintiff's statement of claim discloses no reasonable cause of action? As in England, if there is a change that the plaintiff might succeed, then the plaintiff should not be "driven from the judgment seat". Neither the length and complexity of the issues, the novelty of the cause of action, nor the potential for the defendant to present a strong defence should prevent the plaintiff from proceeding with his or her case. Only if the action is certain to fail because it contains a radical defect ranking with the others listed in Rule 19(24) of the British Columbia Rules of Court should the relevant portions of a plaintiff's statement of claim be struck out under Rule 19(24)(a).
