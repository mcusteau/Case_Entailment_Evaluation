  When an action, such as these, is filed, a party knows only what is in its own file in the Patent Office, the file of the other parties is not of public record. Once pleadings are complete and discovery begins, each party gains access, usually on a confidential basis, to the patent application files of the other parties. Thus it is not unexpected that some of the parties may seek to amend their pleadings, as is the situation here.
