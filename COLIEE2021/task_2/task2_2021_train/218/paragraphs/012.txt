  I adopt Justice Mosley's statement of the law in this regard in  
 Meza Varela v Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 1364 at para 16: "Any efforts must have 'actually translated into adequate state protection' at the operational level." Or, as I put it in  
 Orgona v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2012 FC 1438 at para 11: "Actions, not good intentions prove that protection from persecution is available." At the same time, state protection need not rise to the level of perfection. That a state is unable to provide adequate protection, assessed at the operational level, can be proved with whatever evidence is sufficiently convincing, including documentary evidence.
