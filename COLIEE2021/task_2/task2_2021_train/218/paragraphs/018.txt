  In my view, having regard to the decision as a whole, the Board paid only lip-service to the notion that state protection must actually be sufficiently effective at the operational level and with respect to the persecution suffered by the claimants, to be adequate for the purposes of refugee law. Rather, it placed overwhelming reliance on the government's efforts and good intentions in arriving at its conclusion that state protection was adequate based on the documentary evidence. For that reason too, the Board's decision is unreasonable.
