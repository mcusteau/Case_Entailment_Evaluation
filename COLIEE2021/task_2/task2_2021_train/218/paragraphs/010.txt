  The Board started from the premise that "[a] claimant must show that they have taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek protection, taking into account the context of the country of origin, the steps taken and the claimant's interactions with the authorities." However, whether a claimant has sought, or  
 diligently 
  sought the state's protection is - properly speaking - not a legal requirement for refugee protection. Rather, it goes to whether the claimant has provided the "clear and convincing"  
 evidence 
  that is needed to displace the presumption of state protection. Because of the strong presumption of state protection, concrete, individual attempts to seek the protection of the state are - as evidence - perhaps usually necessary (depending on the circumstances and other evidence) to rebut that presumption. In that sense only, seeking the protection of the state might amount to a  
 de facto 
  requirement in many cases.
