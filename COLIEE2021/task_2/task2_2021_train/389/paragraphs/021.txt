The applicant submits that there is no legal requirement for a refugee claimant to provide corroborating documents for all key pieces of evidence. The applicant cites the Federal Court of Appeal in
Selvarajah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1994] F.C.J. No. 532, where the Court held that a lack of supporting documentation cannot provide the basis for doubting otherwise credible evidence. The applicant also submits that a failure to provide documentation to corroborate a claim cannot be related to the applicant's credibility in the absence of evidence to contradict the allegations, as the Court stated in
Mahmud v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] F.C.J. No. 729. The Board concluded that by failing to provide documents, there was no credible evidence of the applicant's claims, including:
1. Documentary evidence to establish that she returned to Mr. Gonzalez in 2002;
2. Evidence, such as an affidavit from the applicant's sister, regarding the alleged kidnapping of her sister.
The Board provided no other reason to reject these claims other than the lack of documentation and thus, these findings were made in error.
