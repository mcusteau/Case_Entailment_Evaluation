The Board then outlined a number of inconsistencies between the applicant's testimony and the information in the PIF. First, the applicant testified that one of the main motivations for the abuse was that Mr. Gonzalez did not believe that one of the applicant's children was his son. This was not in the PIF and the applicant did not provide a reason for its exclusion. Similarly, the applicant testified that she was raped frequently, but this was also not included in the PIF, so the Board was not persuaded that there was sexual abuse. The applicant testified that the abuse was more sexual than physical, but this did not conform to her descriptions of abuse in her PIF, which indicated the abuse was physical. The applicant testified that she was locked in the house for several days after Mr. Gonzalez found the police reports and that she sought the assistance of a Domestic Violence Prevention and Care Unit, but neither of these claims was included in her PIF. The applicant testified that she left a number of things out. Finally, the applicant testified that Mr. Gonzalez kept her from communicating with her family, but this was also not in the PIF. The applicant explained that she did not narrate her story well. The Board found these omissions to be unreasonable because the applicant affirmed her PIF was complete, she had an opportunity to review and revise it prior to the hearing and the applicant in fact made amendments to the PIF prior to the hearing. In the Board's view, these inconsistencies undermined the credibility of the applicant.
