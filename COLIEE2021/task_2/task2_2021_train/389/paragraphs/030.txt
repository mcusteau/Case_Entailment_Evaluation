The applicant has submitted that the Board misstated her evidence when it said she requested the letters from her family and that the Board erred by assigning little weight to them. However, the applicant has ignored the fact that the Board made a number of other findings regarding the letters. For instance, the Board found that the letters did not indicate instances of abuse or that the family members had witnessed abuse. Also, the Board found that the letters were inconsistent with the information in the PIF regarding threatening phone calls. Although the applicant argues that the Board misstated the evidence regarding the phone calls, the respondent notes that the PIF states that the applicant's family had been threatened by anonymous phone calls, while the letter states that Mr. Gonzalez has called and threatened the applicant, not her family. Finally, the respondent notes that while the applicant did not testify that she requested the letters, she did testify that she had provided them with the address and told them why she was in Canada.
