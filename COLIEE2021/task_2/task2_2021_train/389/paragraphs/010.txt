The Board then considered the applicant's claims that there are ongoing threats to her family and concluded there was insufficient evidence from her family to support these allegations. The Board noted that the letters from family were self-serving and not from uninterested sources. Also, although the applicant claimed her sister was the victim of a kidnapping, there was no evidence of the incident, such as an affidavit from the sister, nor did the sister mention the incident in her letter. The letters from other family members did not include specific details of abuse or any indication that the family witnessed the abuse first hand. The Board acknowledged that the letter from the applicant's cousin indicated that Mr. Gonzalez called often but it did not match the applicant's claim in her PIF that he made threatening calls to the family. Thus, the Board assigned little weight to the letters.
