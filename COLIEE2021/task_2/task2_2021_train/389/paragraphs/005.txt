The applicant alleged that Mr. Gonzalez found her in Villa Del Carbon and threatened her again. The applicant claimed that she told Mr. Gonzalez that she would return, but she was able to buy some time in order to flee to Canada, which she did on August 16, 2007.

The applicant alleges that Mr. Gonzalez still threatens members of her family through telephone calls and she claims that she cannot return to Mexico because of what he may do to her upon her return.
