Certainly Mr. Wheaton, in requesting documents from Canada Post, does not allege a lack of disclosure. In an appropriate instance, it might be open, by further amendment, to allege a refusal and thus bring the matter within the jurisdiction of the Court under section 41 of the
Privacy Act
. However, Canada Post says that it has produced all the records covered by the request to the applicant, with no claims of exemption whatsoever. This is set out in Mr. Sharp's affidavit, which is uncontradicted. More important, this assertion was reviewed by the Privacy Commissioner, whose Director of Investigations, Gerald Neary, wrote to Mr. Wheaton, 19 November 1997, to say, among other things, that Canada Post's initial response to Mr. Wheaton's request had been inappropriate:
"However, following discussions between my officials and Canada Post officials, Canada Post sent you a letter on September 19, 1997, confirming that it has no records regarding a search and seizure order in its files and that in fact search warrants of this kind are illegal under the
Canada Post Corporation Act
.
"Consequently, I am satisfied that you have now received an adequate response concerning the existence of a search and seizure order related to you and that you have receive all the information in the Customer/Claims Service bank that relates to you."
This assertion, that there has been an adequate response and full disclosure, is unchallenged.
