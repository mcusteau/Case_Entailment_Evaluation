I must also consider whether Mr. Wheaton's application is capable of being salvaged by an amendment. Here I ought to look at the whole of the pleading, reading it both in context and with a generous eye. I ought not to strike out, without leave to amend, if there is a scintilla of a legitimate cause of action: see for example
McMillan v. Canada
(1996), 108 F.T.R. 32 (T.D.), at p. 39, where Associate Chief Justice Jerome made the comment at p. 39 that "... there must not be a scintilla of legitimate cause of action for a claim to be struck out without leave to amend.", referring to
Kiely v. Canada (Minister of Justice)
(1987), 10 F.T.R. 10 (T.D.).
