This application was commenced in February of 1998, by an originating notice of motion which sought:
1. All records of correspondence between Canada Post Corporation and the RCMP.
2. All records of correspondence between Anne Felile of Corporate Security (Canada Post) at 604-_________, including email, to the RCMP and Canada Post officials.
3. Any other pertinent information that is related to this action.
without, on its face, background material to place the application for review in any context. On 31 January 2000, at a case management conference, I allowed Mr. Wheaton 14 days within which to serve and file an amended originating document.
