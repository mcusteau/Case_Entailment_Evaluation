I considered both
X. v. Canada
and
Gauthier v. Canada
in
Chandran et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration et al.
(1995), 91 F.T.R. 90 (T.D. Protho.), in the context of an application where documents had been disclosed. In
Chandran
I therefore struck out the application, which was under the
Privacy Act
, the same legislation under which Mr. Wheaton now requests production from Canada Post.
