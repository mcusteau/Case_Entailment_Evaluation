In his oral response to the motion, 12 June 2000, at the case management conference which, in this instance, took place in a room open to the public, Mr. Wheaton went over some factual background including what the Prince Rupert RCMP had said to him, various taped conversations, the involvement of Human Resources Canada in a 1993 or 1994 job creation context and the view that he had been treated unfairly, including that he had been held by the RCMP at gun point. After some further discussion Mr. Wheaton agreed to serve and file written representations.
