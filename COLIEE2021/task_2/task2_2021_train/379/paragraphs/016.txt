In this case, it is not clear that the Applicants' allegations should necessarily be accepted as being true. The Board pointed out that the male Applicant was a failed Convention refugee applicant in the United States. His family resides there. He was deported to Albania from the United States in March 1999 and alleges that he married his wife, contrary to her family's wishes, just three months later in July 1999. It is not for the court to make credibility findings and I do not purport to do so here. However, in view of the known facts in this case, it would be, I think, incumbent on the Board to assess the credibility of the Applicants' allegations.
