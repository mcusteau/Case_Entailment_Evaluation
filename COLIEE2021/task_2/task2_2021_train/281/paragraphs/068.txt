[68]
In my opinion, the Applicant wishes the Court to admit Mr. Joyet's statements for the "truth" of the words spoken by Mr. Joyet, namely, that the word "tradition'l" is clearly descriptive of the intrinsic quality of bagels. Admitting such evidence for its truth would violate the rule against hearsay, and the Applicant has not pointed to any exception to the hearsay rule applicable to the transcript of Mr. Joyet's testimony. In
R. v. Khan
, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531; 113 N.R. 53; 41 O.A.C. 353 and
R. v. Smith (A.L.)
, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 915; 139 N.R. 323; 55 O.A.C. 321, the Supreme Court of Canada held that an exception to the hearsay rule exists where necessity dictates such an exception and where reliability of the evidence is established.
