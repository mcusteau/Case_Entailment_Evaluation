Upon reviewing the Board's decision and the evidence that was before it, I find that it was open to the Board to dismiss the Applicant's opposition on the ground of confusion. I agree with the Board's conclusion that on first impression there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' respective trademarks. In fact, I find there to be almost no points of resemblance between the Applicant's trademarks and the Respondent's proposed trademark when the trademarks are considered in their totality, as the jurisprudence requires. In my opinion, given the significant dissimilarity between the Applicant's trademarks and the Respondent's proposed trademark, this is a case where the degree of resemblance must be given the most weight in determining the issue of confusion.
