In this case, the Applicant has failed to indicate why it is necessary to introduce Mr. Joyet's testimony through the transcript produced in another proceeding. I note that the Applicant could have asked Mr. Joyet about the choice of the word "tradition'l" when it cross-examined him on the affidavit he swore on May 29, 2000. The Applicant gives no reason for not doing so. Aside from that, the Applicant has also not adequately explained why it was unable to put the testimony of Mr. Joyet recorded in the transcript before the Board. The Applicant states that the cross-examination of Mr. Joyet took place in 2004 and, consequently, that the above evidence could not be brought before the Board. However, as noted above, the Board specifically referred to the decision of Justice O'Reilly in
Tradition v. Oshawa Group
. The hearing in that proceeding took place in February 2004 and Justice O'Reilly released his decision on July 20, 2004 - almost five months before the Board released its decision. Given that the Applicant was a party in the proceeding before Justice O'Reilly, the Applicant would have known of the contents of Mr. Joyet's testimony prior to the Board making a decision in the opposition proceeding. If the Applicant felt strongly that Mr. Joyet's statements were probative to the issue of distinctiveness, then it ought to have attempted to bring that evidence before the Board.
