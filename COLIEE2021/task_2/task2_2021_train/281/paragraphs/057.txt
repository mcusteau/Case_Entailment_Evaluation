[57]
The standard of reasonableness applies in circumstances where the Court is reviewing the Board's decision based only on the evidence that was before the Board. However, as previously noted, an appeal pursuant to s. 56 of the
Act
permits either party to introduce new evidence before the Court. In cases where one or both parties elects to do so, the Court will have more latitude in dealing with the Board's decision. In
Labatt
, above at paragraph 29, Justice Marshall Rothstein stated that, where additional evidence is adduced before the Court, the judge hearing the appeal of the Board's decision must come to his or her own conclusion as to the "correctness" of the Board's decisions. Further, as Justice Binnie stated in
Mattel
at paragraph 35, "... [W] here fresh evidence is admitted, it may, [...] require the applications judge to proceed more by way of a fresh hearing on an extended record than a simple appeal".
