Section 2 of the
Act
defines "confusing"; however, it is s. 6 which sets out the criteria governing confusion between marks. Specifically, s. 6(2) states that confusion arises if a prospective purchaser would likely be led to the mistaken inference that the wares or services associated with the respective trademarks are manufactured or performed by the same person. This provision applies only where trademarks are used or intended to be used in the same area. In determining whether trademarks are confusing, the Board must consider the five factors set out in s. 6(5) of the
Act
, namely:
(a) the inherent distinctiveness of the trademarks and the extent to which they have become known;
(b) the length of time the trademark has been in use;
(c) the nature of the wares, services or business;
(d) the nature of the trade; and
(e) the degree of resemblance between the trademarks in appearance or sound or in the ideas suggested by them.
This list is non-exhaustive; the Board must also take into account any other factor relevant to "all the surrounding circumstances": see
Mattel Inc. v. 3894207 Canada Inc. et al.
(2006), 348 N.R. 340; 2006 SCC 22, at paragraph 54, and
Veuve Clicquot Ponsardin v. Boutiques Cliquot lt√©e et al.
(2006), 349 N.R. 111; 2006 SCC 23, at paragraph 21. Moreover, as the assessment is context-specific, each factor considered may be given a different weight. While evidence of actual confusion is a relevant consideration, it is not necessary even where trademarks have operated in the same market area for a long time. However, an adverse inference may be drawn from a lack of such evidence in circumstances where evidence of concurrent use is extensive: see
Dion Neckwear Ltd. v. Christian Dior, S.A. et al.
, [2002] 3 F.C. 405; 286 N.R. 336; 2002 FCA 29.
