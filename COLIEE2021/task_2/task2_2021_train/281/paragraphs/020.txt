A trademark that is "clearly descriptive" or "misdescriptive" cannot be registered pursuant to paragraph 12(1)(b). In order for a mark to be deemed as "clearly descriptive", it must be more than merely suggestive of the character or quality of the wares of services in association with which it is used or proposed to be used. Rather, as Justice Danielle Tremblay-Lamer stated in
ITV Technologies Inc. v. WIC Television Ltd.
(2003), 239 F.T.R. 203; 2003 FC 1056, at paragraph 67, the descriptive character must go to "the material composition or intrinsic quality" of the goods or services or refer to "an obvious intrinsic quality" of the goods or services which are the subject of the trade mark, such as a feature, trait or characteristic belonging to the product itself. Justice Tremblay-Lamer continued by stating at paragraph 71 that it is a matter of first impression.
"The test for determining whether a trademark infringes paragraph 12(1)(b) is the immediate or first impression formed. The determination must not be based on research into or critical analysis of the meaning of the words (
Oshawa Group Ltd. v. Registrar of Trade Marks
, [1981] 2 F.C. 18). The word 'clearly' in paragraph 12(1)(b) is not synonymous with accurately, but rather means easy to understand, self-evident, or plain (
Drackett Co. of Canada v. American Home Products Corp.
(1968), 55 C.P.R. 29). The impression must also be assessed from the perspective of the ordinary, everyday purchaser or user of the wares or services (
Wool Bureau of Canada Ltd. v. Registrar of Trademarks
(1978), 40 C.P.R.(2d) 25). The perspective of experts or people with special knowledge is not representative of the average ordinary purchaser (
Consorizio del Prosciutto de Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc.
, [2001] 2 F.C. 536)."
The onus of establishing that a proposed trademark is "clearly descriptive" or "deceptively misdescriptive" is on the party opposing registration: see
Best Canadian Motor Inns Ltd. v. Best Western International Inc.
(2004), 246 F.T.R. 113; 30 C.P.R.(4th) 481 (F.C.), at paragraph 24.
