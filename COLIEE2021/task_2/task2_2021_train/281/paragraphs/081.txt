In summary, the role of the Board was to consider the factors set out in subsection 6(5) of the
Act
and any other relevant circumstances that arise in this case, and to weigh those factors in determining whether the Respondent met its burden of proving on a balance of probabilities that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' trademarks. In my view, the Board properly considered all the factors set out in s. 6(5) and reasonably concluded that there is no reasonable likelihood of confusion. Consequently, I find no basis for the Court to disturb the conclusion reached by the Board in respect of this issue.
B. Did the Board err in disposing of the Applicant's third ground of opposition in respect to distinctiveness as it did?
