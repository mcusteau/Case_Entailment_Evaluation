[64]
After reviewing Mr. Glowczewski's affidavit, I am satisfied that his additional evidence adds nothing of probative significance to assist the Court in deciding the issues at play in this appeal. In fact, it appears that much of the evidence in Mr. Glowczewski's new affidavit is intended to clarify the dates related to the exhibits attached to his first affidavit. I note that the Board had already accepted that the Applicant had used its trademarks for a longer period than the Respondent had used its trademarks. Moreover, the Board accepted that the Applicant's and the Respondent's wares fell within the "same general category" known as "baked goods". I am also of the view that Mr. Glowczewski's explanation as to why there are no instances of actual confusion between the Applicant's and Respondent's respective trademarks does not materially affect the Board's reference to the fact that no such instances of actual confusion were presented by either party.
