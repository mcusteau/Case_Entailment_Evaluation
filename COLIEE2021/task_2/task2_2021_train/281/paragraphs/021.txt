[21]
A mark which is "clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive" of the wares or services and consequently not registrable under s. 12(1)(b) may still be registrable if the mark is "distinctive" pursuant to s. 12(2). Section 2 of the
Act
defines "distinctive" as a trademark which either (a) actually distinguishes the wares in association with which the trademark is used from other wares, or (b) is adopted to so distinguish between the wares.
