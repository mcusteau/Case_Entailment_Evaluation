The material date for determining confusion differs depending on which section of the
Act
is invoked. Under paragraph 12(1)(d), the material date is that of the Board's decision: see
Park Avenue Furniture Corp. v. Wickes/ Simmons Bedding Ltd.
(1991), 130 N.R. 223; 37 C.P.R.(3d) 413 (F.C.A.), at page 422 [C.P.R.]. The material date for determining confusion under s. 16(3), as stated in that provision, is the date of the filing of the application for registration.
