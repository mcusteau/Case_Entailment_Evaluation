For the purpose of the opposition proceeding, the Board stated that it was comparing the word mark in the Respondent's proposed trademark with the Applicant's word mark TRADITION, since the Board believed "this is the instance where the [Applicant] has the greatest chance of success because the design portions of the [Applicant's] other Trademarks are totally different from the [Respondent's] Trademark". Moreover, the Board stated that for the purpose of its analysis it would "even consider that the use of any of the [Applicant's] design marks as evidence of the use of the word mark TRADITION".
