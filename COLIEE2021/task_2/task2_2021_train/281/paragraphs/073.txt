The Applicant argues that the Board erred in concluding that there was no reasonable likelihood of confusion between the parties' respective trademarks. Specifically, the Applicant claims that the error arose because the Board:
(1) applied the wrong test regarding whether similar trademarks can co-exist among food products in the same general class and sold in the same area of a grocery store;
(2) drew an adverse inference against the Applicant for not adducing evidence of actual confusion between the trademarks of the parties;
(3) focused on the design components of the Respondent's trademark and considering the 'L in TRADITION'L to be a symbol, rather than on the similar sound of the parties' respective trademarks; and
(4) dissected the parties' trademarks in determining the degree of resemblance between them, rather than looking at the similarities of the trademarks as a whole.
