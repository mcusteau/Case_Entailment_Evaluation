 [9] 
  The day before the hearing of this application, Mr. Feimi filed an application for leave to appeal the Federal Court of Appeal's application to the Supreme Court of Canada. In light of the pending application, counsel for the applicant sought an adjournment of the hearing in this matter until the Supreme Court finally disposes of Mr. Feimi's case. The respondent resisted the adjournment, relying on  
 Poggio Guerrero v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2012 FC 937 at para 22 for the proposition that a pending appeal does not change that law and that lower courts are required to continue to apply the law as it stands until it is overturned. I refused the adjournment request because the respondent is correct in this regard: the mere fact of a pending application for leave to appeal in a related matter does not entitle a party to an adjournment where the issue in his case might be considered by a higher court if it grants leave. Were it otherwise, the justice system would grind to a halt.
