  In its decision, the RPD noted that the applicant had been charged with two crimes in the United States: the first, in 1984 for armed robbery (although the charges were dropped) and the second in 1988, for possession with intent to distribute 500 grams of cocaine (for which the applicant was convicted and served 33 months of a 36-month prison sentence, being paroled early for good behaviour). The RPD then assessed whether the latter offence should be considered a "serious crime" within the meaning of Article 1F(b) of the Refugee Convention. In analyzing this issue, the Board held that the relevant factors to be considered were the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts, the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction, as well as whether the offence would have given rise to a sentence of a maximum term of at least 10 years in Canada. On the latter point, the Board reasoned that a crime giving rise to a 10 year or greater maximum sentence creates a presumption that the offence in question is serious, which can be rebutted by consideration of the other factors.
