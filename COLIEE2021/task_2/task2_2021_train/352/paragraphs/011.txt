Mr. Qalawi explained that his father had contacted him and had advised him that an agreement had been reached between the two families, and that he should return to Jordan to marry Faten. While the agreement was not immediately reduced to writing, Mr. Qalawi says that he relied upon the fact that an agreement had in fact been reached to plan his return to Jordan, in order to deliver on his part of the bargain. The Board does not appear to have appreciated this explanation, as it is not specifically addressed in the decision.
