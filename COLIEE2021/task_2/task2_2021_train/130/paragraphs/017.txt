  The respondent counters that the Board has made clear factual findings in the present case, setting out specific acts for which the AFRC was responsible including: abductions, forced labour (including child labour), beatings and killings of civilians, mass rape, and amputations. The respondent argues that accepting the applicant's argument would require the Court to find fault with the Board for simply not stating the obvious, that these crimes are crimes against humanity. The respondent further argues that it is not necessary for the Board to refer to specific international instruments, the real issue being whether the acts identified by the Board are crimes against humanity as defined in the jurisprudence. The respondent argues that it is plainly obvious, having regard to the jurisprudence, that the crimes at issue in the present case qualify as crimes against humanity.
