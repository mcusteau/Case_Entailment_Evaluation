  Though the applicant is asserting that the Board did not address the purpose of the AFRC, this is not accurate. Though arguably the issue could have been more clearly addressed, the Board did review the evidence before it. It found that the documentary evidence left "no doubt as to the nature of the AFRC". The Board further recognized that the AFRC "competed in sheer brutality with the notorious RUF"; that it "was a brutal and systematic violator of human rights whilst in office"; and that it "was more concerned with the pursuit of personal gain". The Board highlighted that the AFRC plundered the resources of the state, and that the management of Sierra Leone's mineral resources was irresponsible and motivated by personal profit. The Board further found that the AFRC had "unconstitutionally seized power and unleashed a reign of lawlessness and violence on the people", and that "the officers who held state functions under the military rule of the AFRC acted with utter impunity" looting civilians' property and beating up and summarily killing both soldiers and civilians.
