  As was recently made clear by the Court in  
 Nagamany 
  at paragraph 37: "it must be kept in mind that one should assess the nature of an organization on the basis of its activities at the time the particular claimant was allegedly involved". That being said, it was not found to be fatal in  
 Nagamany 
  that the Board had referred to events occurring after the time in which the applicant was clearly involved with the organization at issue, in light of the fact that it also referred to ample evidence throughout the time in which he was involved: at para. 39. Having carefully reviewed the evidence, and having acknowledged that the decision of the Board could have been better structured, the Court went on to conclude that the Board's finding that the organization at issue was one with a limited and brutal purpose was reasonable, and should therefore not be set aside:  
 Nagamany 
 , above at para. 41.
