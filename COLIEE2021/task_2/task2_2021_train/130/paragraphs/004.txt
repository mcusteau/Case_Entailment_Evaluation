  In considering the evidence before it, the Board found that the applicant became an official spokesman for the cabal that led the coup, held the position of "Under Secretary of State for Mineral Resources" during the short-lived coup government, participated in negotiations in July 1997 on behalf of the AFRC, and was appointed to the position of "Secretary of State, Marine Resources" in a cabinet shuffle on December 17, 1997. The applicant held this last post until the AFRC was ousted on February 13, 1998. In his submissions in the present case, the applicant has not disputed that he held these positions. He asserts that he fled Sierra Leone on April 1, 1998.
