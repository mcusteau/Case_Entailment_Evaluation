  As was noted by the Court in  
 Taher v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2000] F.T.R. Uned. 498; [2000] F.C.J. No. 1433 (T.D.), at para. 14: "[i]t is trite law that a tribunal must be presumed to have considered all the evidence that was presented to it. Still, a tribunal is not obliged to mention in its reasons all the elements of evidence it has taken into account before rendering its decision. Furthermore, because certain evidence is not mentioned in the tribunal's reasons, it does not mean that such evidence was ignored." See also:  
 Agastra v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 328; 2006 FC 548, at para. 43. That being said, the Board's failure to mention an "important piece of evidence which contradicted its finding" can support an inference that the Board failed to take this evidence into account:  
 Otti v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 610; 2006 FC 1031, at para. 13. I do not believe that the evidence of the announcement made by Major Johnny Paul Koroma required such specific mention as it is at best self-serving in light of the international condemnation directed at the activities of his army and not incompatible with the finding reached by the Board.
