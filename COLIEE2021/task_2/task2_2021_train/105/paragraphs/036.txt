  In my view, the Applicant's real concern and strongest argument on this application relates to the impact of disclosure upon on-going contractual negotiations. Bearing in mind the precautions imposed by s. 47 of the  
 Act 
  and the power granted to the Court under s. 51 of the  
 Act 
 , I have carefully reviewed the evidence submitted by the Applicant on this ground. Taking into account the legal burden upon the Applicant to establish real, as opposed to speculative, interference with contractual negotiations, and the need for a direct link between disclosure and the harm envisaged, I am satisfied that the Applicant has met the burden on this ground. The harm referred to, however, is temporary and not perpetual. It arises out of the exigencies of a particular situation faced by the Applicant.
