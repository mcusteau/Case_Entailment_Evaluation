 [24] 
  In essence, the Applicant says that the  
 Act 
  contains no provision requiring disclosure of a third party document merely because it is referred to in other records that are to be disclosed. A reference cannot necessitate disclosure under the  
 Act 
  if the third party document falls outside the scope of the Request or falls within the exceptions contained in s. 20 of the  
 Act 
 .
