  In the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Information Commissioner (Can.) v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Commissioner) 
 , [2003] S.C.J. No. 7; 301 N.R. 41; 2003 SCC 8, Gonthier, J., applied the pragmatic and functional approach to determine that the standard of review applicable to decisions under the  
 Act 
  is the correctness standard. In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted at pages 7-8: 
 
 
 
 (a) the  
 Act 
  does not contain a privative clause; 
 
 
 
 (b) the  
 Act 
  contains a right to apply for judicial review; and 
 
 
 
 (c) a stated purpose of the  
 Act 
 , as set out in s. 2(1), is to ensure that "decisions on the disclosure of government information should be reviewed independently of government."
