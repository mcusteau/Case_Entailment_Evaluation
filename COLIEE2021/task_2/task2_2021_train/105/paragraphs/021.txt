  The Request was for "a copy of all agreements signed with Jasper Park Lodge since April 1, 1997." The Crown Leases are dated April, 1969 and February 1982 respectively. The Agency thinks the Crown Leases should be disclosed in response to the Request because they are referenced in other documents that do fit the specifics of the Request and because they carry a historical and contextual relevance for agreements signed since April 1, 1997.
