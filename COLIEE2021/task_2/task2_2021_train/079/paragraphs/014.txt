  The Applicants accept that the fact that an outstanding H&C application exists does not, on its own, constitute grounds for the deferral of a removal order; however, the Applicants submit this case presents two factors which warrant a deferral. First, the H&C application has been outstanding since May 2007. The Applicants do not contend that the removals officer ought to have substantively considered the merits of their H&C application, but instead submit that the evidence of the length of time it has been outstanding is relevant to the determination of a removal date. Second, the case of  
 Wang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2001] 3 F.C. 682, 2001 FCT 148 held that an outstanding H&C application which contains allegations of risk to personal safety, as the Applicants contends, may be sufficient as a ground for deferral of removal until after that application has been considered (AR at p. 79).
