  With respect to the second issue, the Applicants acknowledge that a removals officer is not required to undertake a full substantive analysis of the best interests of the children as performed at the stage of H&C. The Applicants instead cite the case of  
 Munar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] F.C.J. No. 1448 (QL), [2006] 2 F.C.R. 664 for the proposition that the best interests of the child should be seen as a continuum with a complete examination being required at the stage of H&C and a less thorough analysis being required when making other determinations, such as whether to defer a removal (AR at p. 80). The Applicants also cite  
 Munar 
 , above, for the proposition that a removals officer ought to consider the short-term best interests of the child (AR at p. 81).
