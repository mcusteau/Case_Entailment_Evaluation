It is this judge's understanding that many of the officers in the Respondent's Ministry who formerly acted as PCDO's now carry responsibility for performing pre-removal risk assessments under the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
. If I am correct in this regard, I suggest for the Respondent's consideration that the pre-removal risk assessment to which the Respondent acknowledges the Applicant is entitled be conducted by an officer other than the officer who produced the decision that is here under review.
