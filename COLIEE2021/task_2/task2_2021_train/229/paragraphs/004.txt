Beginning in 1974, the Applicant was employed by "Aeroflot". In 1990, while continuing her work within Aeroflot, the Applicant started her own small business. She bought items of clothing and footwear in Romania, Poland and Turkey and sold them at a market in Odessa, eventually at a kiosk that she rented in the market. At the end of 1995, the Applicant was approached by an individual who apparently held a relatively senior position at a retail store in Odessa. He offered the Applicant financial assistance in her private business in return for the Applicant's agreement to sell goods that he would supply to her. The arrangement contemplated that she would receive those goods in Turkey and sell them along with her own goods from her kiosk in Odessa. The Applicant agreed to this arrangement. After several trips to Turkey following which the Applicant brought back into Ukraine goods of her collaborator that were intermixed with her own wares, she began to suspect that she was supporting her collaborator in smuggling goods into Ukraine.
