Earlier in these reasons, I outlined the analysis of the PCDO in some detail. It is worthy of note that the CRDD, when it considered the Applicant's Convention refugee claim, had the advantage of oral testimony by the Applicant and apparently also by the psychologist who considered and reported on the Applicant's psychological state. It was not in dispute before me that the PCDO did not have the advantage of hearing the oral testimony of the Applicant and the psychologist. The CRDD determined the Applicant to be "generally credible". It found her testimony was "reasonably consistent and straight forward". The psychologist testified that he as well found the Applicant to be credible. On the basis of the material before it and the testimony before it, the CRDD accepted the psychologist's diagnosis and its likely source. It further accepted that the Applicant was threatened and that the harm she suffered did amount to persecution. It is trite law that past persecution is evidence of the risk of future persecution if the persecuted individual is returned to the conditions where he or she suffered persecution.
