  On the other hand, the reasons given by administrative agencies are not to be read hypercritically by a court ( 
 Medina v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1990), 120 N.R. 385; 12 Imm. L.R.(2d) 33 (F.C.A.)), nor are agencies required to refer to every piece of evidence that they received that is contrary to their finding, and to explain how they dealt with it (see, for example,  
 Hassan v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1992), 147 N.R. 317 (F.C.A.). That would be far too onerous a burden to impose upon administrative decision-makers who may be struggling with a heavy case-load and inadequate resources. A statement by the agency in its reasons for decision that, in making its findings, it considered all the evidence before it, will often suffice to assure the parties, and a reviewing court, that the agency directed itself to the totality of the evidence when making its findings of fact.
