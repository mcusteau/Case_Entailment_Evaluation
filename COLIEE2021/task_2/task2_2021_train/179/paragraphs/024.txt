  In her evidence, which was unchallenged, Dr. Pilowsky described the applicant's symptoms and concluded that: 
 
 
 
 "In my clinical opinion, having reviewed the clinical data emanating from the interview and after analysing the scores from the testing materials, Mr. Cepeda is currently suffering from symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ... This client was likely suffering the full blown PTSD while living in Mexico but it appears that some of his symptoms, such as his nightmares, are abating in Canada. 
 
 
 
 "This client's PTSD condition is a direct result of his traumatic experiences in Mexico as he reported no prior history of psychological problems. ... 
 
 
 
 "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder is a condition highly susceptible to intensification and reinvigoration of symptoms if the sufferer is exposed to triggering stimuli reminiscent of the original trauma. Consequently, it is my professional opinion that if Mr. Cepeda were made to return to Mexico, the site of the traumatizing stressor, he would become retraumatized and his psychological condition would worsen. 
 
 
 
 "If the client is allowed to remain in Canada, the chances for recovery are more promising particularly once the anxiety of his hearing vanishes."
