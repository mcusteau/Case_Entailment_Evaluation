To turn, then, to the defendant's claim that the amount allowed, by Mr. Preston, for direct material costs should be reduced by $75,936.00 and another category of direct costs, called ancillary costs, amounting to $464,304.00, should be added. The deduction of $75,936.00, from Mr. Preston's assessment of direct materials costs, purports to remove therefrom costs relating to: scrap, obsolescence, shrinkage and warranty repairs. The new category of ancillary costs purports to encompass costs relating to: currency fluctuations; inaccuracies in cost records; price fluctuations; learning curve costs; overtime and night shift premiums; production of samples and prototypes; labour costs associated with reworking defective returns; scrap; obsolete components; shrinkage; changes from original specifications. The defendant proposes to determine the amount of such direct ancillary costs on a global basis rather than by specific proof of actual expenditures relating to the infringing rowers.
