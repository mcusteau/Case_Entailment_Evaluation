Mr. Wiener, then, turned to the production cost sheets for the infringing rowers. These are estimates prepared by employees of the company, prior to the manufacture and sale of the rowers. They attempt to forecast the cost of materials and labour for the purpose of enabling the defendant to know at what price the rowers should be sold. Mr. Wiener took the cost of materials (component parts) and labour from these sheets and added thereto comparable cost figures from the production cost sheets for some of the other products sold by the Homeware Division. He did not include in this calculation the 3% which was indicated on the sheets as a cost arising from "waste". Nor did he include the 10% surcharge for material costs and the 12% surcharge for labour costs which had been added, by the defendant to the cost sheets, after Mr. Justice Cullen's decision of July 30, 1987, had been rendered.
