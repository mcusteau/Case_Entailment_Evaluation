With respect to depreciation, I first of all note that the "depreciation" category is one Mr. Belbeck took from the financial statements of the defendant company. He describes this category of expense as a "book depreciation charge" which:
"is an allocation between the periods of capital costs that were incurred and are expected to benefit the company over a duration of several different periods.
"So in that respect, it does not vary unless any expenses or any capital expenditures are subsequently made and in this case, I'm not aware of any capital expenditures specifically for the infringing rowers so I would classify the expense as being fixed for this exercise. I'm not sure if any of the dies or patterns are capitalized. If they are, then presumably that would be reflected in an increased appreciation charge but if the cuts, dies and patterns are accounted for separately then there's no need to adjust the depreciation of them."
