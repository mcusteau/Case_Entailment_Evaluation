[58]
The facts which gave rise to this decision are as follows. Mr. Justice Cullen, on November 30, 1987, ordered the defendant, within 30 days, to "provide the plaintiffs with a list of documents which sets out all documents in the defendant's possession or control which relate to its sales, costs and profits in respect of the infringing units". The defendant was required to provide such documents so "that the plaintiffs may examine the defendant on discovery in connection with the list of documents". In answer to this order a list of documents containing the documents, which the defendant considered relevant and on which they were going to rely was prepared and filed. At discovery, plaintiffs' counsel requested additional documents. In particular, Mr. Jolliffe asked for 1984 financial statements and documents in support of the purchase of specific equipment. These were refused on the ground that they were not relevant to the accounting of profits and the defendant was not relying on them.
