The defendant's Homeware Division used the same plant, equipment and personnel to make the infringing rowers as it used to make noninfringing exercise equipment. No new or additional equipment or machinery was required or purchased (except for a strapping machine) and no new employees were hired except to replace employees who left the company (with the exception of one salesman). Indeed, many of the same component parts are used for infringing and noninfringing equipment.
