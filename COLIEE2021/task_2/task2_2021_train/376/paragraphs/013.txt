While, the defendant accepts that the burden is upon it to prove its relevant costs, counsel argues that in doing so it is only necessary for the defendant to establish such costs on the balance of probabilities (on a reasonable and probable basis). He argues that the referee, Mr. Preston, applied a burden of proof which is applicable in criminal cases, requiring proof beyond a reasonable doubt. I have carefully read Mr. Preston's report and do not find that he imposed so heavy a burden. He required the defendant to prove its costs in accordance with the tests set out by Mr. Justice Addy above. This does not constitute imposing the burden of proof required in criminal cases. This will appear more clearly from what is said below with respect to the various cost items in dispute.
