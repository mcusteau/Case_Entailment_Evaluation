[48]
Two categories of cost, tax on capital and advertising, were treated by Mr. Preston, on the advice of Mr. Belbeck, as variable and an amount was allowed based on the sales ratio. The defendant argues that these are semivariable not variable costs and that the base year approach should be used with respect to them. I will set out some of Mr. Belbeck's evidence in this regard:
"... I have attempted to the extent possible to allocate the advertising expense which I believe to be variable on the basis of an activity level that would be tied to advertising.
. . . . .
"I think that implicitly a best estimate requires some evidence of what the expense includes. For these particular categories where I made an allocation I can be reasonably certain that they are variable with production and sale."
In the circumstances, Mr. Preston's acceptance of Mr. Belbeck's estimate is reasonable.
