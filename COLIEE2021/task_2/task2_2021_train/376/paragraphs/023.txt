In the course of the proceedings, before Mr. Preston, it became obvious that what had been labelled "direct" labour costs, by the defendant, in the above described calculation, included indirect labour costs. The original calculations were accordingly reworked to subtract the indirect labour expense. It is not necessary to describe that calculation in detail except to say that since 1986 was the only year for which appropriate figures were in evidence, an indirect labour factor (as a percentage of direct labour) was established for that year. That factor was then applied to the labour costs shown for all three years, in order to obtain what purports to be the proper direct labour costs for those years. The revised calculations led to the gross profit percentage (as a percentage of sales), for the Homeware Division for 1985, 1986 and 1987 being calculated as 36.35%, 33.05% and 28.29% respectively. Prior to the removal of the indirect labour costs these had been calculated as 31.41%, 28.78% and 22.94%.
