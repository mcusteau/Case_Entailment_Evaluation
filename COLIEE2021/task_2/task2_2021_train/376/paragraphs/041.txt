Mr. Preston's allocation was based largely on the plaintiffs' representations respecting the appropriate approach. He rejected the defendant's proposed method in the following terms:
"He [Mr. Justice Addy in the Teledyne decision] then stated:
'... a reasonable method of calculating the "profit" from the sales of the infringing shower heads of the defendant, is to reduce the sales revenue of those shower heads by:
(a) the variable expenses directly attributable to those shower heads; and
(b) any increase in fixed expenses attributable to those shower heads.'
"It is my opinion that in this case that is what Mr. Belbeck [the plaintiff's expert] is endeavouring to do. In his calculations of increase in the common cost, he has considered, insurance, taxes, some related depreciation, advertising, shipping salaries and expenses, express and cartage and truck expenses for a total allowance of $216,056.00.
"Mr. Wiener, ... as well as allowing all of the above mentioned common expenses has taken rent, machinery repairs and maintenance, factory expense, commissions, selling and travel, design expense, office salaries and expense, postage, telephone and telegram, bad debts, payroll charges, sales discounts and bank interest and has allowed a percentage of the whole expense to be attributable to the production of the convertible rowers. In doing this, without directly linking the expense to the production of the infringing units, he is giving an allocation diametrically opposed to the reasoning of Addy, J., in Teledyne v. Lido, supra, where he stated at p. 213:
'To summarize: the infringer is entitled to deduct only those expenses, both variable and fixed, which actually contributed to the sums received and for which he is liable to account. It follows that no part or proportion of any expenditure which would have been incurred had the infringing operation not taken place, is to be considered as deductible.'"
