Four of the items, which the defendant contends should be dealt with under the ancillary cost heading, relate to labour costs: learning curve costs; overtime and night shift premiums; production of samples and prototypes; the labour costs associated with reworking defective returns. The last (labour costs associated with reworking defective returns) will be considered below in discussing warranty costs. With respect to the first two items, listed above, (learning curve costs and overtime and night shift premiums) there is every reason to think that amounts to cover these were included in the estimates found in the production cost sheets. The figures attributed to labour on those sheets were average cost figures, designed to take account of costs incurred as a result of employees who worked at less than a standard level as well as those who worked at a better than standard level. Mr. Archambault's evidence was that when he checked the cost sheets in 1986 they were an accurate reflection of what it cost the company to produce the rowers.
