With respect to the burden of proof which rests upon the defendant, Mr. Justice Addy in the Teledyne case, at page 209, explained:
"... Where the defendant, as in the present case, has been found at fault and has been ordered to account, that obligation to account rests without reservation entirely on him. There exists no onus whatsoever in this respect on the owner of the property. The judgment obliges the defendant to account for the full amount of all revenue received from the use of the property. Negligent or wilful failure to declare any such amounts might well render the infringer guilty of contempt of court. The amount so declared becomes payable to the rightful owner of the property and
is subject to be reduced only by such bona fide expenses
or disbursements
as the infringer can by positive evidence establish as having been actually incurred
..." (underlining added)
And, at page 213:
"To summarize: the infringer is entitled to deduct only those expenses, both variable and fixed, which actually contributed to the sums received and for which he is liable to account. It follows that no part or proportion of any expenditure which would have been incurred had the infringing operation not taken place, is to be considered as deductible."
