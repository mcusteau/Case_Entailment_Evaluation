Insofar as the appropriate accounting approach is concerned, the defendant argues that the full cost method (sometimes called the full absorption method) should have been used. It is argued that the differential cost accounting approach (sometimes called the incremental approach) is not appropriate because it is a method used to estimate future costs or profits, for present decision making purposes. It is argued that the method is not designed to determine profits already earned. Reference was made in this regard to J.M. Fremgen and S.S. Liao, The Allocation of Corporate Indirect Costs (pages 18 and 19) and to Kohler's Dictionary for Accountants, 6th Edition, ed. W.W. Cooper and Yuji Ijin (pages 172, 256, 257 and 319).
