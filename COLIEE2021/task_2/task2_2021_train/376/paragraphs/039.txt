In the case of semi-variable costs, there is considerable difference between the parties as to the method of calculation which should be used. The plaintiffs' expert proposed, and Mr. Preston accepted, that the fixed component of a semi-variable cost should be identified and subtracted. Then, the sales ratio, referred to above, should be applied to the remaining variable component. The defendant proposed a different approach. Mr. Wiener used 1984 as a base year and then measured the increase or decrease in expenses for the subsequent three years relative to 1984. Increased expenses in those years were then prorated between infringing and noninfringing products sold by Homeware.
