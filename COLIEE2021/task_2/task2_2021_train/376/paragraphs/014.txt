Counsel for the defendant argued, in addition, that the application of the differential or incremental accounting approach is one which by its very nature imposes an unreasonable burden on the defendant. It is argued that this follows because it is impossible, or at least very difficult, for the defendant to prove all its costs using that approach. I have not been persuaded by this argument. In my view, any accounting method will to some extent be an approximation or an estimate. The question is which accounting method is more appropriate for the objective sought by the accounting in question. I am not convinced that the burden on the defendant, arising out of the use of the incremental accounting approach, is so unreasonable, unjust or inexact as to render the approach set out by Mr. Justice Addy inappropriate. Indeed, it is my view that the incremental method gives a truer accounting, of the type required for the purposes of this case, than does the full absorption method.
