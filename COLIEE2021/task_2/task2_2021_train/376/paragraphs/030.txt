Mr. Gayler, undertook on behalf of the plaintiffs, a comparison of the material cost of the component parts which had been estimated on the production sheets with the actual price paid for the component parts appearing on "Cardex Cards". These cards record the actual prices paid by the defendant for the parts during the years in question. Mr. Gayler found the cost sheets to be very accurate. He found that the defendant had slightly over-estimated its costs, by about $16,000.00. This verification by Mr. Gayler, necessarily, took into account any variations from the production cost sheet estimates which would have arisen as a result of currency fluctuations, inaccuracies in cost records or price fluctuations. Thus, three of the items which the defendant alleges would be encompassed by the ancillary costs heading were included in this aspect of the plaintiffs' analysis of the defendant's records.
