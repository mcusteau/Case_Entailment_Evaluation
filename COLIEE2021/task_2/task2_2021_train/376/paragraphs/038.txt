Common costs can be classified as fixed, variable or semi-variable. With respect to fixed costs, these, by definition, do not change with the production and sale of the infringing rowers. Thus, no amount of such costs are to be attributed to the infringing rowers. With respect to variable costs, the parties agree on the method of calculation which should be used. The amount of such costs should be determined by using a sales ratio (sales of rowers to total sales of the Homeware Division). That sales ratio is applied to variable common costs to determine the amount which should be allocated as a cost of the manufacture and sale of the infringing rowers.
