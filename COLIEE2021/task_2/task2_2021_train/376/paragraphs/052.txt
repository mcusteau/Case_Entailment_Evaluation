With respect to three items (selling and travel expenses, office salaries and payroll charges) no amounts were allocated because there was no proof that increased costs had been incurred as attributable to the manufacture and sale of the infringing rowers. Mr. Preston did, however, allocate part of the salary of a salesman, a Mr. Dubé, to the infringing rowers. He found that Mr. Dubé had been hired primarily to sell the rowers in Quebec. He therefore allowed $50,000.00 as a proper cost in this regard. With respect to office expenses, postage and telephone and telegram expenses, the plaintiffs agree with the defendant that there would be costs under the headings attributable to the infringing rowers. However, since the defendant made no attempt to analyse these items in order to present some estimates concerning the fixed as apposed to the variable component, nothing was allowed by Mr. Preston.
