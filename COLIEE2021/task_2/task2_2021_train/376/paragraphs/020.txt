At the same time, I note that Mr. Preston would appear to have allowed the defendant an amount of account of labour costs associated with the production of the destroyed rowers. He accepted the defendant's figure for direct labour costs, which was higher than that proposed by the plaintiffs. He stated that the difference between the two arose because of their different treatment of labour costs with respect to the units which were returned in 1988 and 1989. The plaintiffs chose not to take issue with Mr. Preston's assessment, in this regard. Accordingly, I have not treated it as in issue before me.
