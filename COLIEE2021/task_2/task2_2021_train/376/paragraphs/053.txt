Under the heading design expense, the defendant claimed $36,044.00. This was paid to outside personnel to prepare brochures and manuals on the exercise equipment sold by the Homeware Division. Since no attempt was made by the defendant to allocate this expense as between the convertible rowers and the other equipment, Mr. Preston simply allowed $20,000.00 as the cost attributable to the rowers.
