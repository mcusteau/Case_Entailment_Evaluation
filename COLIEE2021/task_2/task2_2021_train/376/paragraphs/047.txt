With respect to two items of variable costs, bad debts and sales discounts, Mr. Preston did not apply the sales ratio. He took the position that the amount of bad debts which had arisen from the sale of infringing rowers could be specifically ascertained by the defendant from its invoices. Since the defendant had chosen not to attempt to make such a determination, no amount was allocated as an expense under this heading. Similarly in the case of sales discounts, Mr. Preston took the position that the amounts in question could have been specifically determined, had the defendant chosen to do so. Since it chose not to do so, no amount was allowed.
