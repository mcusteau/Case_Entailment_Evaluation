  It is important to point out that this case is unlike those, such as  
 Canada (Secretary of State) v. Charron 
  (1988), 21 F.T.R. 117; 6 Imm. L.R.(2d) 138 (T.D.), and  
 Copeland 
 , above, in which this Court considered that delays in citizenship revocation proceedings were, if anything, to the defendants' advantage, since they allowed them to remain in Canada rather than be deported. The Defendants in the present case gain no advantage from the delays in the revocation of their citizenship.
