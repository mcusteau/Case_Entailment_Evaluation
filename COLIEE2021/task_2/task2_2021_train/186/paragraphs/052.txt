  I am mindful of Justice Bastarache's comment in  
 Blencoe 
 , above, at para. 120, reiterating earlier dicta to the effect that delay or other instances of unfairness only amount to abuse of process in "the clearest of cases." In my opinion, this is such a case. Revocation of citizenship is not an ordinary civil or administrative proceeding. What is at stake is not liability for a sum of money or the issuance of some permit. Along with Justice Iacobucci, and the unanimous Supreme Court in  
 Benner v. Canada (Secretary of State) 
 , [1997] 1 S.C.R. 358; 208 N.R. 81, "I cannot imagine an interest more fundamental to full membership in Canadian society than Canadian citizenship." Of course, if these interests had only been affected by a timely revocation procedure, the Defendants would have no-one but themselves to blame. But to the extent that they have been interfered with by the state-caused delays in this procedure, the state has indeed impacted greatly on their lives.
