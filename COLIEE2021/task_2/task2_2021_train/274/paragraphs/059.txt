The term "citizen" ("citoyen") came into wide use during the French Revolution as "the leaders and supporters of the Revolutionary forces felt that this term, and its connotation in the sense of free and equal participation in the government, seemed best suited to describe how the people felt about their new situation" (see Derek Heater,
Citizenship: the Civic Ideal in World History, Politics and Education
(London: Longman, 1990) at 2, cited in Kaplan, supra, at 248).
