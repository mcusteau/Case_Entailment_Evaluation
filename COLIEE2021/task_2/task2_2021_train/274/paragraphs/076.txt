Under the common law, the general principle was that a child would follow the nationality of its lawful parent (see Note 11). An illegitimate child born outside of His Majesty's Dominions could not derive British nationality through his British father. As a general rule, British nationality could only be passed on through the father, and parents were required to be married. The natural-born child or "bastard" as expressed in the Common law, being filius nullius, could not comply with this requirement: "â€¦ you must shew that his father was a natural-born subject. And if he have no father, then of course he is not entitled to the benefit of the statute": see
