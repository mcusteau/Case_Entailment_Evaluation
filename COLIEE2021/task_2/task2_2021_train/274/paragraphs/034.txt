Pursuant to subsection 12(2) of the current
Citizenship Act
, certificates of citizenship are issued to naturalized citizens after completion of the process but natural-born citizens must make an application for proof of citizenship before any certificate is issued by the Minister. This asks for a correct interpretation and application of any applicable legislation, regulation or order in council by the Citizenship Officer. The requirements for citizenship are enumerated at section 3 of the current
Citizenship Act
which came into force on February 15, 1977. With respect to a person born before that date, "[s]ubject to [the current
Citizenship Act
], [this person] is a citizen if … the person was a citizen immediately before February 15, 1977, or … was entitled, immediately before February 15, 1977, to become a citizen under paragraph 5(1)(b) of the former
Act
" (see paragraphs 3(1)(d) and (e) of the current
Citizenship Act
). Moreover, section 7 of the current
Citizenship Act
provides that a person who is a citizen shall not cease to be a citizen except in accordance with Part II of the current
Citizenship Act
.
