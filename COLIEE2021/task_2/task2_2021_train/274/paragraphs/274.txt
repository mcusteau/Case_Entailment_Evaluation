[274]
While the facts in
Benner
are not exactly the same as these here, the discrimination at issue was perhaps even less evident than the one involved in this case. At paragraphs 90-91, Justice Iacobucci came to the following conclusion:
"... This legislation continues to suggest that, at least in some cases, men and women are not equally capable of passing on whatever it takes to be a good Canadian citizen ...
"For these reasons, I conclude the impugned provisions of the
Citizenship Act
are indeed discriminatory and violate s. 15 of the
Charter
."
