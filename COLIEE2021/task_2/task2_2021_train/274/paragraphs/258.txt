The Respondent's answer to the Applicant's claim is that there is no differential treatment based on an analogous ground of discrimination. Moreover, if there is any "discrimination", it occurred under the former
1947 Citizenship Act
which is no longer in force in Canada since its repeal. Indeed, the current
Citizenship Act
adopted in 1977 preceded the coming into force of section 15 of the
Charter
. However, I have already disposed of this latter argument in a preceding section (see XIII. Retroactive or retrospective application of the
Charter
).
