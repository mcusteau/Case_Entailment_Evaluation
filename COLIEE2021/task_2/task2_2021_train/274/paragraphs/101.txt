While imperfect in its form, I note that the
Canadian Nationals Act
nevertheless confers a distinct and special status to persons who are Canadian nationals. Parliament's intention that this status be virtually immutable and remain attached to that person is evidenced by the fact that a person born in Canada (jus soli) or out of Canada (jus sanguinis) can only cease to be a Canadian national by making a formal declaration of renunciation (s. 3 of the
Canadian Nationals Act
); a procedure akin to the declaration of renunciation of citizenship found in current Canadian citizenship legislation.
