In so doing, I also dismiss the alternative argument made by the Respondent to the effect that the Applicant has lost his Canadian citizenship in the meantime. To the extent that:
(a) the Respondent invokes or is authorized under subsection 3(1), paragraphs 3(1)(d) or (e), or section 7 of the current
Citizenship Act
to rely on the loss of citizenship provisions found in former citizenship legislation, including section 13 of
An Act to Amend the Canadian Citizenship Act
, S.C. 1952-53, c. 23 (the
1953 Citizenship Amendment Act
) and subsection 4(2) of
An Act respecting citizenship, nationality naturalization and status of aliens
, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-19 (the
1970 Citizenship Act
); or
(b) the Applicant is denied the right to make an application for resumption of citizenship as a result of the repeal of the
1970 Citizenship Act
by section 36 of
An Act respecting citizenship
, S.C. 1974-75-76, c. 108 (the
1977 Citizenship Act
) and the application of subsection 3(1) and sections 7 and 11 of the current
Citizenship Act
,
the Court declares that the impugned legislative provisions are contrary to due process and infringe paragraphs 1(a) and 1(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, S.C. 1960, c. 44, reprinted in R.S.C. 1985, App. III (the
Bill of Rights
) and the right of an individual not to be deprived to life, liberty or security of the person except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed by section 7 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
, Part I of the
Constitution Act, 1982
, being Schedule B to Canada Act, 1982 (UK), 1982, c. 11 (the
Charter
). These infringements are not justified under section 1 of the
Charter
and as a result, the above provisions are inoperative.
