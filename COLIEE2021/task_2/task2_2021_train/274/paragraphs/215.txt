The Applicant made an application for proof of citizenship which was rejected on April 5, 2005. I agree with the Applicant that the "discrimination" complained of in this case coincides with the Citizenship Officer's decision to apply the requirement that his mother be Canadian since he was born out of wedlock. According to the un-contradicted evidence submitted by the Applicant, it is the first and only occasion where he was confronted with "discrimination" based on the lineage and sex of his natural parents who were not married at the time of his birth. For this reason, the facts in the present case are quite different from the factual situation considered by the Federal Court of Appeal in
