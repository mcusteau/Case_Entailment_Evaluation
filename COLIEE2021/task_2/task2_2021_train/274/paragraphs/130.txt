At this point, I note that the
1947 Citizenship Act
did not contemplate the possibility that a natural-born Canadian citizen or Canadian citizen lose his Canadian citizenship except in the cases and in the manner provided in Part III (see sections 16 to 25 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
). That being said, section 6 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
expressly dealt with conditions for retention of Canadian citizenship by persons born outside of Canada.
