There is an old French adage that says "qui prend mari prend pays". She who takes a husband assumes his nationality and becomes a citizen of his country. In Roman law the bride said: "And your people shall become my people and your gods my gods". This was particularly true for the women who, at that time, married British subjects. Under diverse naturalization legislation, they automatically became British subjects if their husband was himself a British subject at the time of their marriage. Similarly, a woman became an alien upon marriage to an alien on the date her husband ceased to be a British subject (see Note 10).
