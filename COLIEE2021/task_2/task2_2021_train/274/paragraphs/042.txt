The Applicant further submits that both the prior and current legislative citizenship schemes are "discriminatory". Children born outside Canada, in wedlock or out of wedlock, prior to and after February 15, 1977, are treated differently with respect to the acquisition and the extinguishment of citizenship status. The differential treatment is currently based on one's date of birth (an analogous ground to age) and, in effect, perpetuates former differential treatment based on the marital status and sex of one's parents, which are the key factors to determine whether citizenship is derived from one's father or mother. The Applicant submits that such differential treatment reflects a demeaning and prejudicial view of "illegitimate children" which is discriminatory and infringes the rights to equality guaranteed by subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
