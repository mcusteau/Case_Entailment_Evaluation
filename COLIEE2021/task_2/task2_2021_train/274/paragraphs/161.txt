Apart from the statutory interpretation issue raised in this proceeding, it can be said that the conduct and inaction of the Respondent and past officials certainly raised a legitimate expectation that war brides and their children would be treated as "Canadian citizens" once they were legally admitted in Canada. In this regard, there is no indication in the record that the wives and children of members of the Canadian Armed Forces who did not qualify as "Canadian citizens", were ever informed by Canadian authorities that they needed to apply for naturalization. There was no contemporary public announcement submitted as evidence in this proceeding to the effect that the "illegitimate children" born outside Canada of members of the Canadian Armed Forces (who had legally landed in Canada with their mothers prior to January 1, 1947), had to apply for Canadian citizenship.
