Until 1947, two kinds of passports, each differentiated by colour, were issued in Canada, one for British-born citizens and one for naturalized citizens (see note 17). The familiar blue passport booklet with pale pink pages similar to the booklets with blue pages issue to British subjects appeared sometime after the adoption of the
1947 Citizenship Act
. That being said, as of July 1948, passports were issued by the Canadian government only to Canadian citizens.
