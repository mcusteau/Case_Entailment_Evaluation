Parliament enacted the
Act to Amend the Canadian Citizenship Act
, S.C. 1953, c. 23 (the
1953 Citizenship Amendment Act
) on May 14, 1953. As far as this case concerns the interpretation and application of section 4 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
, one must consider the effect of the
1953 Citizenship Amendment Act
because it was made retroactive to January 1, 1947 (see Note 20).
