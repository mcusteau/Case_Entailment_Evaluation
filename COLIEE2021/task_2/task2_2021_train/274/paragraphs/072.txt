In 1914, an attempt was made to develop a cooperative scheme of naturalization throughout the British Empire. Naturalization laws were more or less "imperialized" by the enactment of the
British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914
(U.K.), 4 & 5 Geo. V, c. 17 (the
1914 British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act
), which allowed for "imperial" rather than merely "local" naturalization, with the proviso that it had effect in other Dominions only if they too had adopted a parallel measure. The Canadian Parliament acquiesced to this common plan by re-enacting the
1914 British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act
including those parts which related to broader issues of national status rather than "naturalization", narrowly construed: see
Naturalization Act
, S.C. 1914, c. 44 (the
1914 Naturalization Act
) (see Note 9).
