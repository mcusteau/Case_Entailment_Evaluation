As can be seen from the comments above, the purpose of the
Canadian Nationals Act
was "to define a particular class of British subjects who, in addition to having all the rights and all the obligations of British subjects, have particular rights because of the fact that they are Canadians". This definition is much akin to the present concept of "citizenship", which does not automatically confer the status of Canadian citizen to a citizen of the Commonwealth.
