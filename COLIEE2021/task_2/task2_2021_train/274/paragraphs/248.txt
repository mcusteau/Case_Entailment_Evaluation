I am uncomfortable with the Respondent's answer that ignorance of the law is not an excuse. There are a number of countries in the world where birth within their territory (jus soli) does not automatically confer citizenship. Certain foreign countries may require that at least one of the parents of that child be a citizen of this country. This means in practice that persons born outside Canada prior February 15, 1977, whose two parents were Canadian citizens or nationals at the time of birth, ran the risk of losing their Canadian citizenship, which is the only national status they would have possessed at the time of their 24th birthday.
