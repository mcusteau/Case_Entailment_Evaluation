Coming back to the rationale for allowing a
Charter
challenge in
Benner
, supra, Justice Iacobucci examined the Respondent's argument to the effect that the rights granted under citizenship legislation "crystallized" at birth. He writes at paragraph 50:
"
The respondent urged us to find that the key point in the chronology of events was the appellant's birth in 1962
. The respondent argued that the focus placed on birth by the impugned citizenship legislation suggests that the rights granted under that legislation 'crystallize' at birth: see
Crease v. Canada
, [1994] 3 F.C. 480 (T.D.).
Whatever discrimination took place in the appellant's case, therefore, took place when he was born, since that is when his rights were determined under the impugned legislation
. To revisit these rights in light of s. 15, according to the respondent, is therefore inescapably to go back and alter a distribution of rights which took place years before the creation of the
Charter
." (Emphasis added)
