[28]
At the hearing of this judicial proceeding in Vancouver, on May 30, 2006, Respondent's counsel asserted that there is no legal way whatsoever that the Applicant can be recognized today as a Canadian citizen, unless he is naturalized and makes a formal application for a grant of citizenship under section 5 of the current
Citizenship Act
. Respondent's counsel also informed the Court that he had no instructions whatsoever to settle the case or to agree to any consent order (as was done in
Augier v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] 4 F.C.R. 150; 256 F.T.R. 231 (F.C.), a case which presents similar, albeit not identical, features as the case at bar).
