In substance, the following persons are "natural-born Canadian citizens": (1) persons born in Canada; (2) persons born on a Canadian ship; (3) persons not in either of the former categories, but whose father, or in the case of a person "born out of wedlock", whose mother falls within either category or is a British subject with Canadian domicile and who fulfills a number of conditions which vary according to whether a person is born before or after January 1, 1947 (see sections 4 and 5 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
). On the other hand, the following persons, who though they may not be "natural-born Canadian citizens", are nevertheless "Canadian citizens": (1) British subjects who have Canadian domicile immediately before January 1, 1947; (2) British subjects who have been naturalized under any act of the Parliament of Canada and have not become aliens on January 1, 1947; (3) British subject women lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence who are married to men who, if the
1947 Citizenship Act
had come into force immediately before the marriage, would have been "Canadian citizens" (see section 9 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
).
