Where a person was deemed a "bastard" at birth, there was formerly no way in which he could be made "legitimate", except by an Act of Parliament. Indeed, until the passing of the
Legitimacy Act, 1926
(U.K.), 16 & 17 Geo. V, c. 60 (the
1926 Legitimacy Act
), the law of England had always refused to accept the doctrine that a child "born out of wedlock" might be legitimated by the subsequent marriage of his parents (

, 3rd Ed. (London: Butterworths, 1955) vol. 3 at paras. 146-47).
