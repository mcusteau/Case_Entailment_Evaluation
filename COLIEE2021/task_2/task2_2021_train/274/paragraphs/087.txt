Since Parliament has the authority to adopt an immigration policy, it follows that it can enact legislation prescribing the conditions under which "non-citizens" or "aliens" will be permitted to enter and remain in Canada: see
Chiarelli v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711; 135 N.R. 161. It did so, as early as 1869 (see Ninette Kelley and Michael Trebilcock,
The Making of the Mosaic, A History of Canadian Immigration Policy
(Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1998) c. 3).
