While "citizenship" describes a status that can be conferred by the state to an individual, "nationality" means membership in a "nation". Indeed, citizens are referred to as "nationals" when they travel abroad. The Applicant was a Canadian national by descent (jus sanguinis) because he was the son of a Canadian citizen. The Applicant's father was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen under the
1910 Immigration Act
. The Applicant remained a Canadian national until the
Canadian Nationals Act
was repealed and I have determined that he became a Canadian citizen on January 1, 1947. He cannot be deprived of his status of Canadian national or citizen without due process.
