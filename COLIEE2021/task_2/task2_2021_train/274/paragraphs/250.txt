The fact that an individual who has lost his citizenship can submit an application for resumption of citizenship to the Minister may provide some form of acceptable alternative remedy, especially if any certificate of citizenship accordingly issued has a retroactive effect, as was the case under prior citizenship legislation (see section 6 of the
1970 Citizenship Act
). But, the Respondent submits in this regard that December 31, 1970, is the latest date on which a person born outside Canada, before 1947, could have retained Canadian citizenship by virtue of having filed a declaration of retention of citizenship, or by having established a permanent abode in Canada. Consequently, on January 1, 1971, entitlement to Canadian citizenship by virtue of birth outside Canada before 1947, to a parent born in Canada, was extinguished. No possibility for citizenship status, other than through naturalization, remained for such persons, regardless of the status of their parents at the time of their birth or thereafter.
