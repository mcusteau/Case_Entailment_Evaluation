[277]
The Court considered subparagraph 5(1)(b)(i) of the
1970 Citizenship Act
. Justice Mosley concluded at paragraphs 21, 23-24:
"In my opinion, the provision at issue in this case clearly draws a formal distinction between Mr. Augier and others on the basis of two personal characteristics, namely, the relationship status of his parents at the time of his birth and the gender of his Canadian parent at birth. Marital status has been interpreted as an analogous ground of discrimination.
(. . . . .)
"In my opinion, a reasonable person in circumstances similar to the applicant would find that paragraph 5(2)(b) of the current
Act
reflects a demeaning and prejudicial view of the applicant's worth, simply because he was born 'out of' wedlock. He is denied the benefit of applying for Canadian citizenship through his claimed Canadian father, a benefit which similarly situated individuals born outside of Canada prior to February 15, 1977 whose parents were married, receive and enjoy. Furthermore, this benefit is denied on the basis of the gender of his parent, as unwed Canadian fathers cannot pass their citizenship to their children, whereas unwed Canadian mothers can do so.
"Paragraph 5(2)(b) of the current
Act
is implicated in this proceeding. As that section currently reads, children of Canadian mothers who would not have been entitled to claim citizenship by virtue of subparagraph 5(1)(b)(i) of the
1970 Act
are given the benefit of claiming citizenship, however, children of Canadian fathers similarly precluded by virtue of subparagraph 5(1)(b)(i) of the
1970 Act
are denied this benefit. Therefore, paragraph 5(2)(b) of the current
Act
, as it now reads, infringes the applicant's right to equal treatment under the law pursuant to section 15 of the
Charter
."
