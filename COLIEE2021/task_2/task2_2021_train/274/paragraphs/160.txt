Indeed, the overwhelming documentary evidence produced by the parties, or judicially noticed by the Court, supports the general belief that dependents of natural-born (or naturalized) Canadian Armed Forces soldiers, who legally landed in Canada prior to January 1, 1947,
automatically
became "Canadian citizens" when the
1947 Citizenship Act
came into force. This belief is based on the legal assumption that these soldiers were themselves natural-born or naturalized Canadian citizens on January 1, 1947. Therefore, their wives (whether they were British subjects or not) and their children (whether they were born in wedlock or out of wedlock) were not required to apply for naturalization.
