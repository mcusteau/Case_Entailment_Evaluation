After the coming into force of the
Charter
, certificates of citizenship are requested by the parents. They learn at this point that only Robert is a Canadian citizen. A variation of the same example involves Albert. He is now 25 years old and he wants to get a Canadian passport. His passport is refused because he is not Canadian. Despite the fact that Albert is the same age as his brother (after all, only four minutes separate the two brothers), he learns that he is not a Canadian citizen. Besides, he is also told that had he had the ability to claim citizenship, he lost it at the age of 24 when he failed to apply for retention of his citizenship. Again, I fail to see how a proceeding instituted by Albert or his parents to have the impugned legislative provision declared inoperative under the
Charter
and the
Bill of Rights
can be dismissed on the basis that the
Charter
or the
Bill of Rights
cannot apply retrospectively, unless restoring the "crystallization of rights" theory that has been rejected by the Supreme Court in
Benner
.
