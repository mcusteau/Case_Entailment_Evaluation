Justice Létourneau pointed out that the real source of the appellant's complaint was the
1947 Citizenship Act
, which assigned Canadian citizenship only to children born abroad in wedlock who had Canadian fathers. The
1977 Citizenship Act
sought to correct this by bestowing citizenship upon children born abroad after February 14, 1977, from either a Canadian mother or father. The appellant's complaint, according to Justice Létourneau, was that by not addressing persons born before February 14, 1977, the new
Act
did not go far enough in correcting the injustices of the
1947 Citizenship Act
, and just as subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
could not be applied retroactively to bring the
1947 Citizenship Act
in line with the
Charter
, neither could it be applied to the
1977 Citizenship Act
. According to Justice Létourneau, any discrimination against the appellant "crystallized" on the date of his birth in a foreign country when the
1947 Citizenship Act
refused him citizenship because his father was not Canadian. It was at the point of his birth - August 29, 1962 - that legal consequences were attached to his situation. (Justice Létourneau also determined, should the
Charter
apply, that there was no discrimination on the basis of sex since under the
1977 Citizenship Act
children born outside of Canada after February 14, 1977 derived citizenship from either a Canadian father or mother.)
