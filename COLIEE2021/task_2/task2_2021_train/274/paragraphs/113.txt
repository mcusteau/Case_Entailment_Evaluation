Based on the evidence on record, I find that at least until October 11, 1948, Canadian authorities granted the Applicant and his mother all the rights and privileges normally afforded to Canadian citizens while travelling abroad. Moreover, as we will now see under Canadian immigration legislation both of them were deemed to be "Canadian citizens" since their landing in Canada. As such, they were allowed to return, establish themselves or remain in Canada as any other Canadian citizens.
