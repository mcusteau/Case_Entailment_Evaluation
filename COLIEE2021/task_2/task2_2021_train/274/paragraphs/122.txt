As noted by Justice Bastarache in
Lavoie
, supra, at paragraph 57, the
1947 Citizenship Act
sought to clarify confusion over the use of the terms "citizen" and "national" in federal legislation and create a unifying symbol for Canadians (see
House of Commons Debates
(22 October 1945) at 1335ff (the Hon. Paul Martin Sr.)). Indeed, the
1947 Citizenship Act
merges the concepts of "nationality" and "citizenship" into a single status, that of "Canadian citizen", while incorporating and adapting naturalization procedures earlier developed in Canada (see Parry, supra, at 467-522).
