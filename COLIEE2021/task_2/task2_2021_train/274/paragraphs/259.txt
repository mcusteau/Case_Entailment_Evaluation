[259]
In the case at bar, we are confronted with the application of the current
Citizenship Act
in a way that operates to deny Canadian citizenship to children born out of wedlock outside of Canada prior to February 15, 1977, and where it appears that at the time of the child's birth, the mother was neither born in Canada, nor possessed a Canadian domicile (prior to 1947), nor was a Canadian citizen (after 1947). It is clear that the 1977 amendments which resulted in the enactment of the current
Citizenship Act
were designed to overcome the apparent inequalities that existed under previous citizenship legislation.
