[167]
The modern principle has been cited and relied on in innumerable decisions of Canadian courts, and in
Rizzo & Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)
, supra, it was declared to be the preferred approach of the Supreme Court of Canada (see also
Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex et al.
, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559; 287 N.R. 248; 166 B.C.A.C. 1; 271 W.A.C. 1 at para. 26). In this regard, an interpretation that defeats the spirit of legislation, while complying with the literal meaning of the words employed, should be avoided if the words reasonably bear a more plausible meaning. Moreover, courts have jurisdiction to correct drafting errors, redress inappropriate avoidance measures and fill gaps in legislative schemes (see
Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes
, supra, c. 6).
