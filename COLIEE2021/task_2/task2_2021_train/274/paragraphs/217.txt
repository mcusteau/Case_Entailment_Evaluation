[217]
Therefore, in light of the evidence on record, I conclude that the Applicant was "confronted" (within the meaning of
Benner
, supra, or at para. 55) with the loss of citizenship provisions only when (1) he was informed in 1999 that he had "lost" his Canadian citizenship on his 24th birthday, and (2) in February 2003 when he was told that his first application to obtain a certificate of Canadian citizenship would not be forwarded for further processing because he had "lost" citizenship the day he turned 24. These two events occurred well after the coming into force of the
Charter
and they involve the interpretation and the application of the current
Citizenship Act
.
