Second, the Supreme Court of Canada examined the constitutionality of certain provisions of the current
Citizenship Act
with respect to the application of equality rights provision in
Benner v. Canada (Secretary of State)
, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 358, where the impediment to the retrospective or retroactive applicability of
Charter
was also raised by the Respondent. Applying the approach developed by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Benner
, the issue that confronts this Court is whether the current
Citizenship Act
continues to perpetuate past discrimination. Despite its repeal, amendment or replacement, the
1947 Citizenship Act
continues to be invoked today as a bar to a citizenship claim made under the current
Citizenship Act
. I therefore conclude that this case is simply one of assessing the contemporary application and legality of laws which continue to produce legal effects today.
