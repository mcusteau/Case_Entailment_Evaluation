[119]
On May 14, 1947, the
Act to Amend the Immigration Act and to Repeal the Chinese Immigration Act
, S.C. 1947, c. 19 (the
1947 Immigration Amendment Act
), was assented to. The applicable immigration legislation had been amended in order to permit the landing in Canada of the war brides and the war children who were still in Europe. In the
1952 Revised Statutes of Canada
, the aforementioned provision became s. 83 of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1952, c. 145. It appears to have remained part of the
Act
until 1970 when the
Immigration Act
was again revised and the section removed (see
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1970, c. I-2).
