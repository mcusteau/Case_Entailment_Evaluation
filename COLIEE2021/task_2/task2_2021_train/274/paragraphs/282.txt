[282]
I fail to see any sufficiently pressing and substantial objective in continuing to deny citizenship status to persons born out of wedlock outside Canada prior to February 15, 1977. It has not been explained to the Court why only certain provisions of the current
Citizenship Act
have a retrospective character. If Parliament was ready in 1977 to correct retrospectively discrimination directed against women resulting from past discriminatory treatment based on sex, I fail to see why there would not be compelling reasons to correct the injustice caused to all "illegitimate children" born abroad prior to and after 1947 who could not by descent derive Canadian citizenship from their natural father. Apart from the fact that it coincides with the coming into force of the current
Citizenship Act
, the date of February 15, 1977 appears purely arbitrary.
