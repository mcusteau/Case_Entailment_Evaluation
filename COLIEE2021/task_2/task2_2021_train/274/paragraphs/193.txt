[193]
Associate Chief Justice Jerome held that the
Charter
could not be applied to the appellant's case since he was seeking a retrospective application of the
Charter
(see
Benner v. Canada (Secretary of State)
(T.D), [1992] 1 F.C. 771 (F.C.T.D.)). The Federal Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appellant's appeal (see
Benner v. Canada (Secretary of State)
(C.A.), [1994] 1 F.C. 250 (F.C.A.)). Justices Marceau and LÃ©tourneau held that the
Charter
did not apply, because his complaint related to the circumstances of his birth, which had occurred 20 years before the
Charter
came into force in 1982. Justice Linden concluded that subsection 15(1) of the
Charter
applied to the appellant's case, and that the legislation was discriminatory, but that it was saved under section 1 of the
Charter
.
