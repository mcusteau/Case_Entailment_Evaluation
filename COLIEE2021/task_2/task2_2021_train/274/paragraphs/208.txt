[208]
I do not see any reason to depart from the approach taken by Justice Mosley in
Augier
, supra. In my opinion, the
Benner
decision is not limited to the constitutionality of paragraph 5(2)(b) of the current
Citizenship Act
but stands for the broader proposition that it is discriminatory to treat children born abroad as having different rights based on the gender of the parents on whom they base their claim to citizenship. The fact that
Augier
dealt with an individual born out of wedlock after 1947 in circumstances not exactly similar to that of
Benner
, was found by the Court not to be material. I am also comforted by the fact that the Federal Court of Appeal decided in 2001 that the reasoning in
Benner
applies equally to a person born in wedlock outside Canada to Canadian-born mothers prior to January 1, 1947 (see
McLean v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] 3 F.C. 127; 270 N.R. 133 (F.C.A.) at paras. 9-18).
