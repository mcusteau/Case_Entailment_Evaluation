While he was growing up in England, the Applicant was informed by his mother and believed himself to be "half-Canadian" and "half-British". Both he and his mother thought they were citizens of both Canada and the United Kingdom. When he was about 7 or 8 years old, the Applicant started to ask questions about his father in Canada. His mother still had the Applicant's father's address in British Columbia. The Applicant corresponded on a fairly regular basis with his father for a couple of years, until the correspondence with his father became less frequent and, eventually, ceased.
