That being said, the Minister may, in his discretion, issue or grant a certificate of citizenship to "a person with respect of whose status as a Canadian citizen a doubt exists", and also to "a minor in any special case whether or not the conditions required by this
Act
have been complied with" (paragraphs 11(a) and (b) of the
1947 Citizenship Act
, as amended by section 6 of
An Act to Amend the Canadian Citizenship Act
, S.C. 1950, c. 29 (the
1950 Citizenship Amendment Act
) and by section 7 of the
1953 Citizenship Amendment Act
). Moreover, the
1947 Citizenship Act
provides that the question as to whether any person had "Canadian domicile" immediately prior to the
Act's
coming into force, "shall be determined by the same authority and in a like manner as if it arose under the
Immigration Act
" (see section 43 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
). By way of consequential amendments to the
1910 Immigration Act
, the definitions of "domicile", "Canadian domicile" and "Canadian citizen" were amended and clarified (see
An Act to amend the Immigration Act
, S.C. 1946, c. 54).
