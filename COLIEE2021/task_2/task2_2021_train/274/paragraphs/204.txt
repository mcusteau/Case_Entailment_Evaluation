[204]
Accordingly, in view of the comprehensive and authorative character of the Supreme Court decision in
Benner
, I am reluctant to rely on the prior dicta in
Benner
and
Crease
of the Federal Court of Appeal and of this Court with respect to retroactivity and discrimination. The decisions of this Court in
Dubey
and
Wilson
, supra, are attempts to distinguish the Supreme Court decision in
Benner
(see Notes 23, 24 and 25). In my opinion, these precedents are not determinative, and I note that a contrary result was achieved in
Augier v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] 4 F.C.R. 150 (F.C.), a more recent decision of this Court.
