As can be seen, Order in Council, P.C. 858 was not merely directed at overcoming immigration issues of entry. It was designed, as the plain meaning of the Order in Council describes, to give a special status to individuals who were children or dependents of armed forces personnel serving abroad. The intention of Parliament is made clear by the wording of the Order in Council, P.C. 858 in the recital and in its specific order.
