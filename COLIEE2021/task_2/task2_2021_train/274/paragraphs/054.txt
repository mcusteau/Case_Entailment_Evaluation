[54]
In this regard, the Respondent submits that there are two consistent features in the historical documents, cases and commentary:
(a) A general avoidance of the use of the word "citizenship" when discussing nationality prior to 1947. The words "subject", "national", "naturalization" and their derivatives are instead used synonymously for the term "citizen" as we know it today.
(b) When the term "citizen" is used prior to 1947, it generally refers to the term as defined in the
1910 Immigration Act
, and notes that the term has been defined for the specific purposes of that
Act
.
