I pause here to mention that the facts in
Mack et al. v. Canada (Attorney General)
(2002), 165 O.A.C. 17; 60 O.R.(3d) 737 (C.A.), leave to appeal dismissed [2002] S.C.C.A. No. 476; 319 N.R. 196; 191 O.A.C. 200 (S.C.C.), offer an interesting illustration of an attempt to redress events which took place before the
Charter
. At issue were the federal
Chinese Immigration Acts
in force from 1885 to 1923; these immigration laws imposed a "head tax" on persons of Chinese origin upon entering Canada, thus making it very difficult to immigrate to Canada from China. The claimants included both people who had paid the head tax and descendants of persons who had either paid the head tax or suffered in other ways from the application of these laws. They sought the return (with interest) of the head taxes paid and damages. The Ontario Court of Appeal, affirming the trial judge, acknowledged that the laws discriminated on the ground of race, and would today offend the
Charter
. However, the laws were repealed in 1923, and since the laws were not in force at the commencement of the
Charter
, those whose rights were denied by the laws had no remedy under the
Charter
.
