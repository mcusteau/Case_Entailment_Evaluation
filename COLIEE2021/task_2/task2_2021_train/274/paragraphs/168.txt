[168]
The decision under review refers to the
1947 Citizenship Act
. Since the Applicant was born outside Canada before January 1, 1947, the Citizenship Officer based her decision on the purported effects of paragraph 4(b) of the
1947 Citizenship Act
(see Note 21). The Applicant does not contest that a literal interpretation of section 4 of the
1947 Citizenship Act
supports the conclusion reached by the Citizenship Officer. However, the Applicant submits that this provision should not be read in isolation. It must be construed in a manner consistent with the purpose, object and effects of Order in Council, P.C. 858, which specifically provides that dependents of members of the Canadian Armed Forces who are "Canadian citizens" or have "Canadian domicile" acquire, upon landing in Canada, the same status as the members. Since the Applicant's father was a natural-born Canadian citizen, the Applicant submits that he must also have the same status of a natural-born Canadian citizen.
