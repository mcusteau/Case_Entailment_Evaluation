 [54] 
  It is trite law that one of the principal requirements of the Act is that persons who wish to live permanently in Canada must, prior to their arrival in Canada, submit their application outside Canada and qualify for a permanent residence visa. Though subsection 25(1) of the Act allows the Minister to dispense with this legal obligation in certain cases, this is clearly meant to be an exceptional remedy. It is, moreover, a  
 discretionary 
  remedy which is properly within the jurisdiction of the Minister, and not this Court. This Court is not in a position to re-weigh the relevant factors in reviewing the exercise of ministerial discretion under that subsection.
