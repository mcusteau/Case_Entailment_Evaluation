  In this case, no additional information or documentation was submitted to the Officer. The Applicant only provided a list of the type of information she intended to submit if her request for reconsideration was granted. I find, on the basis of  
 Malik 
 , that this is insufficient. A request for reconsideration based on new documentation can only succeed if the documents in question are actually put before the officer concerned, thus allowing the officer an opportunity to decide if such documents are sufficiently important and pertinent to form the basis for a decision to reconsider. Here, there were submitted to the Officer no documents upon which a decision to reconsider could have been based.
