  In  
 Malik v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 1283, [2009] F.C.J. No. 1643 (QL), I held on the basis of  
 Sharma v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 786, [2009] F.C.J. No. 910 (QL) that the reasoning of Justice Mactavish in  
 Kurukkal 
  extends as well to decisions of immigration officers regarding applicants under the federal skilled worker category. However, I also held that though a visa officer may reconsider a decision in appropriate circumstances, a visa officer is under no obligation to reconsider, except in circumstances of bad faith. I held as well that, in order for such a reconsideration to occur, the additional information which forms the basis of the request for reconsideration must actually be provided to the visa officer.
