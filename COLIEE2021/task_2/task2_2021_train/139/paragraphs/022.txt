  Subsection 25(1) of the Act provides for a discretionary power of the Minister to grant an exemption from any criteria or obligation of the Act in circumstances where the Minister is of the opinion that this is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to a foreign national.

 discretion 
  or policy, deference will usually apply automatically (
