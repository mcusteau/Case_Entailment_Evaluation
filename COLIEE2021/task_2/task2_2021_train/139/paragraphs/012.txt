  On the second issue, procedural fairness, the Applicant alleges that, at the interview, the Officer provided her views of the merits of the H&C application and gave the impression that the outcome would be positive, and actually directed the Applicant not to provide further information. This lulled the Applicant into a false sense of security, and resulted in the Applicant not providing additional documentation such as: 
 
 
 
 (a) updated statements from her and her co-tenant and pictures taken since the birth of her daughter; 
 
 
 
 (b) updated information concerning harassment by the co-tenant's former boyfriend; 
 
 
 
 (c) updated information on her co-tenant's school plan and work situation and on the future plans of the Applicant and her co-tenant.
