The plaintiffs own an eighty-foot yacht, the "Lady J I". On May 7 1995, while the plaintiff Ralph Jordan was using a remote control device supplied by the defendant to pilot the vessel at the Ballard Locks in Washington, U.S.A., the vessel was involved in a collision. On May 24 1995, the plaintiffs' solicitors informed the defendant that the collision was due to the malfunction of the remote control and that they were holding the defendant responsible for the damage resulting from the accident. (Affidavit of Mark Woodall, sworn February 21, 1996, Exhibit A (hereinafter Woodall affidavit).)
