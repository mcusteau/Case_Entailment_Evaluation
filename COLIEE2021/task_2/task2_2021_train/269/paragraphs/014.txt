[14]
The defendant draws a distinction between the purposes for which defendants appoint adjusters and the purposes for which plaintiffs appoint adjusters. The defendant asserts that as a result of this distinction, adjusters' reports produced for a defendant should be treated differently for purposes of privilege than reports produced for a plaintiff. The defendant submits that as a defendant, the only purposes for which Towns Marine appointed the adjuster would be either to determine insurance coverage or to defend claims. According to the defendant, because the Prothonotary correctly held that insurance coverage was not the reason for which the reports had been prepared, the only remaining possible reason was for the defence of the defendant's claims.
