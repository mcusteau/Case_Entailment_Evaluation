It is apparent from the foregoing that, in reaching his decision, the Prothonotary exercised his discretion by reference to proper principles with due regard to the facts. That, in itself, is sufficient to dispose of the matter. (On an appeal from a decision of a prothonotary, a judge should refrain from exercising his discretion de novo unless it can be shown that the decision under appeal was clearly wrong ie. that it was based upon a wrong principle or a misapprehension of the facts.
