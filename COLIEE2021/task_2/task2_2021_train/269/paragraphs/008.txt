The Prothonotary reviewed the affidavit evidence provided by the defendant in support of its claim that the adjusters' reports were privileged. In this respect, he concluded as follows:
"There is nothing in the Woodall affidavit to indicate either that Mr. Woodall had any say in appointing solicitors or even when Mr. Woodall became aware that insurers had appointed counsel to represent Towns. Solicitors were in fact appointed July 20, however, the July 25 report is only addressed to the insurer.
"As I concluded earlier, the affidavit in support would carry much more weight had it been that of the insurer. But even assuming that one were to give full weight to the Adjuster's affidavit, it would establish at best only that there was reasonable contemplation of litigation, probably before the date of the first report. The affidavit material falls far short of showing that the dominant purpose was to instruct counsel, at least to the first three reports. The adjuster does not say when he became aware that counsel had been instructed to act for Towns: all one can infer is that the Adjuster was not aware of the existence of counsel until some point before he prepared the fourth and final report, the one addressed jointly to the insurers and to counsel. Given the changing circumstances and assuming the grant of full weight to the Adjuster's affidavit, I would on that basis allow the claim of privilege for the last report. However, I must also consider the reports themselves." (p. 14)
