  While the Court of Appeal relies upon  
 Société Gamma 
  for the proposition that the confidentiality of amounts paid or payable by a government pursuant to a contractual obligation with third parties is not confidential after the bidding process has been completed and the contract awarded, I note that Strayer, J. (as he then was), stated in  
 Société Gamma 
  at paragraph 5: 
 
 
 
 "[...] Proposed prices per word to be paid under the contract are deleted." 
 
 
 
 and at paragraph 9: 
 
 
 
 "[...] Many of the concerns expressed by it to the respondent including the possible harm to it of revealing information as to price, personnel, and equipment have already been met by the respondent agreeing to sever portions of the proposals dealing with these matters." 
 
 
 
 Accordingly, in  
 Société Gamma 
  the unit prices per word for the translation contract were not being disclosed and were not the subject of review by Justice Strayer. In the case at bar, there is a history of confidentiality between the applicant and Public Works. Public Works has agreed in the past and agrees in this case, that the unit prices per dose are confidential, financial and commercial information not to be disclosed. Accordingly, the rational of the Court of Appeal in  
 Hi-Rise Group Inc. 
 , supra, does not apply. In this case, the applicant understood that the monetary terms of the contract would remain confidential while the total contract price would be public.
