  In reviewing the decision under s. 44 of the  
 Act 
 , the standard of review is correctness. The Court will consider whether this information ought to be disclosed on a de novo basis. Accordingly, the decision of Public Works to disclose is not owed any deference. The Court's analysis must be guided by the principle of public accessibility to information contained in government records, as this is the purpose of the  
 Act 
 . However, Parliament has provided that a government institution shall refuse to disclose certain records provided to government by third parties. A party seeking exemption from disclosure has a "heavy onus" to prove that the information is exempt from disclosure. See my decision in  
 Canada Post Corp. v. National Capital Commission 
  (2002), 221 F.T.R. 56 (T.D.), at paragraph 8. See also
