  The case at bar is easily distinguished from  
 Hi-Rise Group Inc. 
  in that the Federal Court of Appeal held at paragraph 33: 
 
 
 
 "The question to be answered in the present case was therefore whether the respondent, assuming that its proposal was successful, could reasonably expect that amounts paid or payable to it out of public funds pursuant to the ensuing contract would remain confidential by reason of the fact that the process which led to the grant of the contract was confidential." 
 
 
 
 In the present case, it is clear that both the applicant and Public Works accepted and expected that the unit prices per dose paid under the contract would remain confidential while the total contract price would be made public. Obviously, any other information in the contract which would disclose the unit price would also remain confidential.
