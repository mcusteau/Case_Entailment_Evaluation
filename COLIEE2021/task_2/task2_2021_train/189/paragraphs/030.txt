  The current so called "Qu√©bec Sponsorship Scandal" underlines the importance that government contracts should be made public and transparent unless it is contrary to the public interest. Consequently, Public Works should make clear at the outset of any bidding process whether the ultimate contract will be disclosed, or whether parts of it will be kept confidential in the public interest. If Public Works determines that the some of the terms should remain confidential, it should also clearly set out how the public benefit is fostered by maintaining confidentiality. Such a determination by Public Works would not foreclose a s. 44 review by the court, however, it would go a long way to clarifying the expectations of the parties and identifying the public interest considerations involved.
