  In  
 Canada Post Corp. v. National Capital Commission 
 , supra, I held that negotiated terms cannot be characterized as information "supplied to a government institution by a third party". McGillis, J., came to a similar conclusion in  
 Halifax Development Ltd. v. Canada (Minister of Public Works and Government Services) 
 , [1994] F.C.J. No. 2035 (T.D.). To hold otherwise would broaden the scope of the exemption and prevent the public from having access to much of the information contained in government contracts.
