  With respect to condition 2, the jurisprudence sets out three requirements that must be met in order for the information to be considered confidential. MacKay, J., in  
 Air Atonabee 
 , supra, at paragraph 42 summarized the test as follows: 
 
 
 
 "[...] whether information is confidential will depend upon its content, its purposes and the circumstances in which it is compiled and communicated, namely: 
 
 
 
 (a) that the content of the record be such that the information it contains is not available from sources otherwise accessible by the public or that could not be obtained by observation or independent study by a member of the public acting on his own, 
 
 
 
 (b) that the information originate and be communicated in a reasonable expectation of confidence that it will not be disclosed, and 
 
 
 
 (c) that the information be communicated, whether required by law or supplied gratuitously, in a relationship between government and the party supplying it that is either a fiduciary relationship or one that is not contrary to the public interest, and which relationship will be fostered for the public benefit by confidential communication."
