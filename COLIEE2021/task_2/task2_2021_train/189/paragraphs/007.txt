 [7] 
  Public Works decided that the unit prices per dose in the contract are exempt from disclosure under paragraphs 20(1)(b) and (c) of the  
 Act 
 . In other words, the unit prices are confidential financial, commercial information, and the disclosure of the unit prices could reasonably be expected to result in material loss to the applicant or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the competitive position of the applicant.
