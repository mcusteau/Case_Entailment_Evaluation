It is not my function in an application for judicial review of one decision to address non-compliance with an order made by another judge. The difficulty is that all assessment appeals since then have continued to run afoul of the limitations imposed by the original entitlement decision. The order which is before me suffers from the same defect. While it is admitted that Mr. King suffers from a multitude of misfortunes, all attempts to have his assessment increased run into the issue of his entitlement to pen­sion for conditions which, according to some of the medical evidence at least, are the direct consequence of his original injury. Referring this matter back to another As­sessment Appeal Board will not change the result because that Board is limited to deal­ing with assessment questions.
