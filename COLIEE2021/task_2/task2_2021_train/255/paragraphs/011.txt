"... In that letter the physician noted he had examined the Appellant on 25 November 1997 and found straight leg raising and reflexes were normal, forward flexion restricted to hands to mid-thigh. He said medication included Tylenol #3 and InÂ­docid, and indicates the Appellant has intractable pain involving the upper lumbar area with radiation to the upper back, neck and to both legs. He wears a back brace. According to Dr. Li the Appellant uses a TENS machine and requires the use of a walker. He has sleep disturbances and the pain affects his sexual enjoyment."
