Mackay, J., held that the Board erred in law in not taking into account and acting upon evidence which would have justified referring Mr. King's file to the Commission for reconsideration of his entitlement. If, as the Commission appears to have concluded, there was a problem of "fit" between the assessments and the entitlements, the quesÂ­tion of reviewing the entitlement ought to have arisen rather than simply slashing Mr. King's assessments. His order that the Board refer the matter to the Commission for review of entitlement was intended to have that issue addressed.
