The next issue is the question of reme­dies. Counsel for Mr. King argues that the Board is bound to accept the uncontradicted evidence of Mr. King's family physician and that therefore the Board should assess Mr. King's disability in accordance with Dr. Li's assessment. In my view, this shows a mis­understanding of the nature of the Board's review. As the Board noted at the beginning of its decision, it accepted as accurate the "summary of evidence in the Assessment Review Panel documentation." I know of no principle which would require the Board to disregard the evidence which has ac­cumulated in a claimant's file over a period of time. As a result, it would require a detailed analysis of all the evidence on Mr. King's file to determine if Dr. Li's evidence is uncontradicted. Had the Board given reasons, one could determine which evidence it relied upon in choosing not to give effect to Dr. Li's evidence. All this to say, that this court cannot simply direct the Board to give effect to Dr. Li's evidence.
