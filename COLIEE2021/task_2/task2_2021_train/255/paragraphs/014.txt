In reviewing the Table, one is left to wonder how the Board concluded that the 10 to 20% range of disability was found to be appropriate. It is true that Dr. Li noted that reflexes were normal and straight leg raising was normal. These two elements taken by themselves would put Mr. King in the 10 to 20% range. But they are not by themselves. They are accompanied by intractable pain, use of a walker or wheelchair, use of a back brace, reduced flexion, all of which suggest a higher rating than 10%. None of this is addressed in the Board's reasons. The reaÂ­sons given by the Board are not responsive to the evidence and are inadequate.
