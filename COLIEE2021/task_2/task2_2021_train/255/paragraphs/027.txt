The panel of the Board to which the matter was remitted considered that it could not embark upon an entitlement review and did not refer the matter to the Commission as ordered. Its conclusion was as follows:
"It is clear therefore that the Board is limited to the consideration of matters that are appealed to it, and the
Act
provides no mechanism pursuant to which the Board may consider matters that have not been brought before it on appeal. Furthermore, it is solely with an applicant that the onus to initiate an appeal resides and the Board may not undertake an appeal of any part of a Commission decision rendered pursuant to section 87 or 8 unless it is specifically requested to do so by an applicant."
