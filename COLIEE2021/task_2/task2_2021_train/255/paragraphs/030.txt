The appeal which is the subject of this application was, it appears from the record, in response to a determination by the Min­ister on or about July 17, 1997 as to the assessment of Mr. King's condition. Neither the application nor the decision is contained in the record before me so I do not know what was contained in the application. Pur­suant to s. 85 of the
Pension Act
, the Min­ister is entitled to reconsider his decision if asked to do so by the Board.
"85(1) The Minister may not consider an application for an award that has already been the subject of a determination by the Veterans Review and Appeal Board or one of its predecessors (the Veterans Appeal Board, the Pension Review Board, an Assessment Board or an Entitlement Board) unless
(a) the applicant has obtained the per­mission of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board; or
(b) the Veterans Review and Appeal Board has referred the application to the Minister for reconsideration."
"85(1) Le ministre ne peut étudier une demande de compensation déjà jugée par le Tribunal ou un de ses prédécesseurs - le Tribunal d'appel des anciens combattants, un comité d'évaluation, un comité d'exa­men ou le Conseil de révision des pensions - que si le demandeur a obtenu l'autorisa­tion du Tribunal ou si celui-ci lui a ren­voyé la demande pour réexamen."
