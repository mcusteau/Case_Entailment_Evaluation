Pelletier, J.
: When Robert King fell off a personnel carrier in 1968 and injured his back, he could not know that 30 years later he would still be fighting with the veteran's pension administration over his disability pension. But it is now 1999 [see footnote 1], and Mr. King brings an application for judicial review of yet another appeal from yet another unsuccessful review his pension assessment. There was a time when Mr. King's pension, though not necessarily to Mr. King's satisfaction even then, was con足siderably more generous than it is now. But in 1991, the Director of the Pensions Medi足cal Advisory Directorate (the "Director") who had not examined Mr. King, nor read his entire file, determined that Mr. King's pension assessment had been badly over足stated. The Director recommended drastic reductions in Mr. King's pension assessment and, notwithstanding the prior rulings of its own assessment panels, the Pension Commis足sion implemented the recommendations without prior notice to Mr. King. He has been fighting to have his pension reinstated to its former level ever since.
