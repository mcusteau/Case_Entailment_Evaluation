In
Mehterian v. Minister of Employ­ment and Immigration
, [1992] F.C.J. No. 545 (C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal held that where reasons are required to be given, " the reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible that the claimant may know why his claim has failed and decide whether to seek leave to appeal, where necessary". In that case, as in this one, the reasons consisted of a statement of conclu­sions reached but did not show how that conclusion had been reached.
