This application is the latest skirmish in this struggle. It is an application dated July 24, 1998 for judicial review of the decision of the Veteran's Review and Appeal Board ( the Board) dated May 8, 1998 affirming a decision of an assessment panel dated De足cember 11, 1997, which the Board declined to reconsider as evidenced in a letter dated July 2, 1998. The latter date is important since it is from this date that Mr. King reckons the 30 days within which he must begin his application for judicial review. [see footnote 2] The respondent argues that the application is out of time since it was com足municated to Mr. King in May and s. 18.1(2) of the
Federal Court Act
makes the date of communication the trigger date, not the date of some later proceeding. While the respondent is generally correct in its posi足tion, in the circumstances of this case, I exercise my discretion to extend the time for the bringing of the application for judicial review up to and including July 24, 1998, the date of the notice of application. I do so because I believe that it is in the interests of all parties including the court to have parties attempt to resolve their differences between them before resorting to judicial intervention. As a result, I am prepared to extend the deadline to allow for exploration of mean足ingful alternatives to court applications.
