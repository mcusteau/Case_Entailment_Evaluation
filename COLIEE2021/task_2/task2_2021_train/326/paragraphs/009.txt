Accordingly, on August 13, 2002, the I.T.U.M. Council (still represented by its chief) signed a new employment contract with Mr. Sioui. Not only did this new contract extend the term of the agreement until December 31, 2004, but it also adjusted upward Mr. Sioui’s remuneration and annual vacation and assigned to him the additional responsibility of overseeing the Executive Committee as its president. This new contract also included important amendments to the rescission and discharge provisions, including a stipulation that, in the event the employer was to terminate the contract in the year prior to its expiration, the employee would be entitled, not only to a compensation equal to the remaining balance of the employer’s obligations (which was already provided for under the original contract signed in 2001), but also to a compensation equal to one year of salary (s. 11(f) of the contract, set out at page 100 of the applicant’s record). It was furthermore agreed that (Translation) "in the event the employee is unable to perform his duties due to exceptional circumstances, such as acts of violence, intimidation, aggression or serious threats in the workplace, the employer shall pay the employee a termination of employment sum corresponding to the remaining balance the employee is owed under this agreement", with an additional year if these exceptional circumstances were to occur during the last twelve months of the agreement (s. 11(g)).
