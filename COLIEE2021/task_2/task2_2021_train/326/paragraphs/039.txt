In order to prove the existence of a custom, two elements must be established: the first one, an objective one, requires that there be a certain number of occurrences (which, under some circumstances, may be replaced by an isolated act such as the adoption of a general rule or of an electoral code). An accumulation of occurrences is, however, insufficient; a subjective element must be added thereto: compliance of the persons affected by this practice. After a thorough review of the relevant case law, Mr. Justice Martineau gave a good summary of the applicable rules at paragraph 36 of
Francis v. Mohawk Council of Kanesatake
, supra:
"For a rule to become custom, the practice pertaining to a particular issue or situation contemplated by that rule must be firmly established, generalized and followed consistently and conscientiously by a majority of the community, thus evidencing a 'broad consensus' as to its applicability. This would exclude sporadic behaviours which may tentatively arise to remedy certain exceptional difficulties of implementation at a particular moment in time as well as other practices which are clearly understood within the community as being followed on a trial basis. If present, such a 'broad consensus' will evidence the will of the community at a given time not to consider the adopted electoral code as having an exhaustive and exclusive character. Its effect will be to exclude from the equation an insignificant number of band members who persistently objected to the adoption of a particular rule governing band elections as a customary one."
