The evidence reveals that the I.T.U.M. Council was undergoing a severe financial crisis in 2001. Indeed, the Department of Indian Affairs had asked the Council to remedy to its financial affairs because its debt load was above eight percent. Accordingly, on August 6, 2001, the Council adopted an economic recovery plan and, by way of a resolution on August 10, 2001, created an Executive Committee to oversee this recovery plan. The committee, presided by Konrad Sioui, was assisted by the PriceWaterhouse Coopers firm, which was appointed co-manager by the Council.
