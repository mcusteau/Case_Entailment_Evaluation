In this instance, the respondentsâ€™ evidence does not allow me to rule with certainty as to the existence of the custom relied upon. It seems that a certain number of resolutions were, indeed, adopted in the past by distributing them amongst the members of the I.T.U.M. Council; it would even appear that the applicant himself signed some of them. However, in addition to the fact that this type of procedure was not often followed (given the exceptional nature thereof, that is not surprising), nothing in the evidence adduced leads me to believe that this so-called custom was generally accepted by the community and a broad consensus of the Band members was present.
