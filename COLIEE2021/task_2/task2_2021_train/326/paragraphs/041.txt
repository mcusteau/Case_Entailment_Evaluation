Moreover, were I even willing to accept the existence of such a custom, the requirements governing its application do not appear to me to have been met. Firstly, the evidence reveals that the Secretary of the I.T.U.M Council failed to check whether dissident councillors Albert Vollant and Brigitte Andr√© were available to attend a Council meeting. Furthermore, I am somewhat suspicious of the urgency to act in the midst of an electoral campaign, considering that the issue of the compensation to be paid to Konrad Sioui in the event of a changing of the guard following the July 2004 elections had been debated since at least March 2003. This is an issue that could have undoubtedly been debated during the last regular meeting of the I.T.U.M. Council; the decision to proceed by way of a "flying resolution" instead was perhaps made in order to divert attention from the planned contractual amendments and to avoid paying the political price for it, as the applicant claims.
