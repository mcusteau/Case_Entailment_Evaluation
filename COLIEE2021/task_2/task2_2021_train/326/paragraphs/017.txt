Following the election of Chief Élie-Jacques Jourdain, Konrad Sioui submitted his resignation by registered mail on July 9, 2004. The declarations that the new chief allegedly made before, during and after the election campaign about his intention to discharge Mr. Sioui as soon as he was elected were recited at length before me. The respondents also allege that Mr. Sioui was subjected to threats and intimidation and that it would have been impossible for him to continue to live on the reserve following the elections. I need not rule on these claims for at least two reasons. First, it is patently obvious that the duties to be performed by Mr. Sioui for the chief required a relationship of trust that simply did not exist with the new chief. Considering the degree of animosity between the two men, it is very difficult to see how Chief Élie-Jacques Jourdain could have made Konrad Sioui his political lieutenant. On the other hand, it is settled law that a public authority body may not refrain from exercising its powers by claiming that it had valid reasons to do so.
