In addition, according to the evidence, some of the councillors seem to have been told that the purpose of this resolution was to thank the Executive Committee for the work it had performed during its term of office. The applicant further alleged that the signatories of this resolution were unaware of the overall decisions and actions undertaken by the Executive Committee during its term of office, that the members of the I.T.U.M. Council were not convened at meetings of the Executive Committee and that they did not even receive agendas or minutes of these meetings. The respondents, however, claim that the Chief was the direct link between the Council and the Executive Committee, that the Executive Committee meetings were open to the councillors, and that the Executive Committee reported directly to the I.T.U.M. Council on the progress and application of the recovery plan. After a careful review of the affidavits and examinations, I lend more credibility to the respondentsâ€™ testimony on this, to the extent that it has any relevance to the legal issues raised.
