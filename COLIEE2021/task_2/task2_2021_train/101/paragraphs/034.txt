  I am unable to agree. The Guidelines effectively provide a special opportunity to Applicants to draw to the attention of the person reviewing their H&C application any considerations relating to their abusive relationship and the listed factors that may be relevant to their application. In addition, they require a PRRA Officer to be particularly sensitive to the Applicant's situation and to the fact that she may have lost the sponsorship of her former partner by leaving the abusive situation.
