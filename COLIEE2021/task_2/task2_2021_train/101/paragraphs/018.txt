  I am satisfied that in the case at bar, the PRRA Officer was not cloaking adverse credibility findings in conclusions that the evidence adduced by the Applicant was not sufficient. In each instance, it was reasonably open to the PRRA Officer to conclude, without making an adverse credibility finding, that the evidence adduced was not sufficient to establish, on a balance of probabilities, the claims advanced by the Applicant.
