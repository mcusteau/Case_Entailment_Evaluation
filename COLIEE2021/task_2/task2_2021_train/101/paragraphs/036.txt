  To elevate the special opportunity contemplated by the Guidelines to a rebuttable presumption would place Applicants from abusive relationships in a better position than all other H&C Applicants, and would be inconsistent with the highly discretionary nature of the power conferred by section 25. I am unable to agree that this result was intended when section 13.10 was inserted into the Guidelines.
