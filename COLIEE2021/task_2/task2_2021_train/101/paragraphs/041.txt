  I do not agree. The paragraphs in question were in the section of the Officer's decision that addressed the hardship that the Applicant claimed she would face upon her return to St. Lucia. At the outset of that section, the Officer specifically stated: "I recognize that the threshold is one of hardship for an H&C application and not section 96 or 97 of the [IRPA]. This H&C application has been assessed on the basis of unusual and undeserved, or disproportionate hardship."
