 [3] 
  The Applicant seeks to have the PRRA Officer's decision set aside on the basis that she erred by: 
 
 
 
 i. rejecting the H&C application without granting the Applicant an interview to address alleged credibility concerns; 
 
 
 
 ii. failing to apply and follow section 13.10 of Guideline IP 5, issued by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada, entitled  
 Immigration Applications in Canada made on Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds 
 ; 
 
 
 
 iii. failing to reasonably apply those guidelines, to reasonably assess the best interests of the Applicant's child, and to reasonably assess the nature of the hardship that she claims she will face if required to return to St. Lucia; and 
 
 
 
 iv. applying an incorrect test in the assessment of her application.
