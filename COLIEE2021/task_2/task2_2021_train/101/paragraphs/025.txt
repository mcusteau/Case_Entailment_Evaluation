  The Guidelines stated the following: 
 
 
 
 Immigration Manual, IP 5, Section 13.10 
 
 
 
 Family members in Canada, particularly spouses, who are in abusive relationships and are not permanent residents or Canadian citizens, may feel compelled to stay in the relationship or abusive situation in order to remain in Canada; this could put them at risk. 
 
 
 
 Officers should be sensitive to situations where the spouse (or other family member) of a Canadian citizen or permanent resident leaves an abusive situation and, as a result, does not have an approved sponsorship. 
 
 
 
 Officers should consider the following factors: 
 
 
 
 - Information indicating there was abuse such as police incident reports, charges or convictions, reports from shelters for abused women, medical reports, etc.; 
 
 
 
 - Whether there is a significant degree of establishment in Canada (see Section 11.2, Assessing the applicant's degree of establishment in Canada); 
 
 
 
 - The hardship that would result if the applicant had to leave Canada; 
 
 
 
 - The customs and culture in the applicant's country of origin; 
 
 
 
 - Support of relatives and friends in the applicant's home country; 
 
 
 
 - Whether the applicant is pregnant; 
 
 
 
 - Whether the applicant has a child in Canada; 
 
 
 
 - The length of time in Canada; 
 
 
 
 - Whether the marriage or relationship was genuine; and 
 
 
 
 - Any other factors relevant to the H&C decision.
