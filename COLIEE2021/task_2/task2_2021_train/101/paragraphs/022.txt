  As to the best interests of her daughter, the Applicant's submissions were focused on her ability to continue to support her daughter's attendance at a prestigious school. However, the Applicant adduced no evidence regarding the costs of her daughter's schooling and the extent to which the Applicant's return to St. Lucia might impact upon her daughter's ability to stay in that school. On the basis of this evidentiary record, and considering that the Applicant will be reunited with her daughter when she returns to St. Lucia, I am unable to conclude that the Officer erred in her consideration of the interests of the Applicant's daughter.
