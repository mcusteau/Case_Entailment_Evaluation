  As noted in  
 Baker 
 , above, at para. 72, in respect of a different section of the Guidelines: "The guidelines are a useful indicator of what constitutes a reasonable interpretation of the power conferred by" section 25 of the IRPA, and the fact that a decision may be "contrary to their directives is of great help in assessing whether the decision was an unreasonable exercise of the H&C power." Thus, even where a decision is contrary to the Guidelines, it is not necessarily unreasonable. This is at least in part because the power conferred by section 25 is "highly discretionary and fact-based" ( 
 Baker 
 , at para. 61).
