  As noted by Justice Snider in  
 Alexander v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2012 FC 634, [2012] FCJ No 863: 
 
 
 
 [14] As the Respondent notes,  
 Owusu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2004 FCA 38 at para 8, [2004] 2 FCR 635, teaches that "applicants have the onus of establishing the facts on which their claim rests". Although the Applicant says a positive determination based on her establishment in Canada was inevitable, this is simply not the case. The evidence as to her establishment in Canada was that she has family here, has worked here, and has become connected to the community here.  
 Inherent in the notion of H&C applications is that hardship is a normal consequence of deportation proceedings, and that relief is to be granted only when hardship goes beyond the inherent consequences of deportation. The Officer considered all of the evidence and reasonably concluded that the Applicant's establishment would not cause undue hardship.
