  In  
 Lalane v Canada 
   
 (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 6, [2009] FCJ No 658 [ 
 Lalane 
 ], Justice Shore noted: 
 
 
 
 [1] The allegation of risks made in an application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (H&C) must relate to a particular risk that is personal to the applicant. The applicant has the burden of establishing a link between that evidence and his personal situation. Otherwise, every H&C application made by a national of a country with problems would have to be assessed positively, regardless of the individual's personal situation, and this is not the aim and objective of an H&C application. That conclusion would be an error in the exercise of the discretion provided for in section 25 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA) which is delegated to,  
 inter alia 
 , the Pre-removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) officer by the Minister (
