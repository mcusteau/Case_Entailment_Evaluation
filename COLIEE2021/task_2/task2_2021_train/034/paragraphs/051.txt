 [51] 
  The Officer did not err in the BIOC analysis. The Officer was "alert, alive and sensitive" to the BIOC:  
 Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] 2 SCR 817, [1999] SCJ No 39 at para 75. The starting point is to determine where the best interests of the child lie and the Officer did so. The Officer determined that the applicant's best interests were to return to his family in Sri Lanka. While the applicant takes the position that his best interests are to remain in Canada, the case law has established that while life may be better in Canada for children, more is required to justify an exemption relying on a BIOC analysis (see, for example,  
 Hawthorne v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2002 FCA 475, [2002] FCJ No 1687 at para 5).
