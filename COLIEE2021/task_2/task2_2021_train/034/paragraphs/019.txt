  Justice Tremblay-Lamer found that on the facts of that case, the officer had applied the wrong test: 
 
 
 
 [14] Furthermore, the officer's decision shows that he accepted the applicant's allegations of discrimination, and then discounted their significance through the wrong legal analysis: 
 
 
 
 [w]hile it is true that discrimination is a fact of life for ethnic and religious minorities in Israel,  
 this does not in itself constitute persecution, nor demonstrate that the Israeli government is unwilling an unable to protect the applicant. 
  The documentary evidence indicates that Israeli citizens can expect the  
 protection of the police and the courts 
 , and that official recourses exist for individuals who feel they have been the object of discrimination by police officers. [Emphasis added] 
 
 
 
 [15] The officer essentially accepted the fact of discrimination, but failed to properly consider whether it constituted unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship for the applicant in the circumstances, as required in the context of an H&C application. Instead, his analysis reveals that he applied a PRRA analysis in rejecting the discrimination as a valid ground for granting the H&C application. This is an error in law, and warrants the intervention of this Court (
