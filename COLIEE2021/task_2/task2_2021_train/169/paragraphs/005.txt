  With respect to the Applicant's claim that she would be forced to undergo FGM, the Board found that the Applicant had fabricated the allegation, stating the following: 
 
 
 
 "The claimant wrote in her PIF that, 'I was lucky because my father was an educated man; he got his education in France and, like some other educated people, he did not agree with the custom of having daughters circumcised. My mother did not talk about having the excision but she did not arrange for me to have one'. Documentary evidence indicates that while FGM is still common in Mali it is done in girls at an early age. This document states in part that, 'FGM was in general performed on females between the ages of 12-14. However, in the past two years, young girls between seven and forty days are more at risk. The reason behind this rising phenomena is that girls at the age of 12-14, are now more educated [than] in the past, and they prefer to leave their community to escape the practices'. The claimant is twenty-one and reasonably well-educated. I find that she is not at risk of being forced into FGM."
