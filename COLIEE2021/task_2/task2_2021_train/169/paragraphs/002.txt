  The Applicant raises three issues: 
 
 
 
 1. By aggressively questioning and interrupting the Applicant, did the Board fail to allow the Applicant to be heard, thus breaching the rules of procedural fairness? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the Board reach its conclusion on the risk to the Applicant of having to undergo FGM without regard to the documentary evidence? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the Board err by failing to apply IRB Guideline 4,
