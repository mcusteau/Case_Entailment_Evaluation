 Snider, J. 
 : Ms. Houleymatou Sy is a citizen of Mali who came to Canada to study in 2000. In 2002, she made a claim for protection based on her fear of being forced into marriage with an older cousin and fear of having to undergo female genital mutilation ("FGM") prior to her marriage. In a decision dated June 9, 2004, a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board, Refugee Protection Division (the "Board") determined that she was not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. She seeks judicial review of that decision.
