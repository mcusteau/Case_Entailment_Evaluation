 [4] 
  Having reviewed the transcript, I am satisfied that the Applicant was not prevented from making her case. The transcript does not bear out the Applicant's contention that she was interrupted and prevented from adding further details. Further, she was represented by counsel at the hearing. After the questioning by the Board, her counsel was able to (and did) pose questions and make final submissions. While the Applicant, after the fact, may have thought of further things to say or points to make, I am satisfied that she was given a fair opportunity to make her case. There was no breach of fairness.
