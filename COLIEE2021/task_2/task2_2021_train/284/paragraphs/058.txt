Costs will be taxed according to the court's tariff currently in force, unless the respective solicitors come to an agreement which shall settle costs. The plaintiffs' counsel does not persuade the court to include the earlier costs awarded against the plaintiffs, nor to award costs on the scale which he advocates. The case presented certain difficulties, to be sure, as was noted by the court at trial's end. It could well be that the plaintiffs' solicitors and counsel were therefore quite justified in exploring avenues which ultimately were not on the critical path from assertion of claim to judgment. Accordingly in the exercise of the court's discretion, the plaintiffs may recover 130% of all taxed solicitors and counsel fees prescribed by the court's current tariff and the same shall be shown, either with the 30% added, or at 130% in the taxed and certified bill of costs. The court suggests that payment be made in trust to the plaintiffs' solicitors upon condition of their giving their indemnity and the plaintiffs' release in a form approved by the defendants' solicitors before disbursement by the plaintiffs' solicitors.
