The plaintiffs also claim punitive damages. However, having limited their claim to one of tortious conversion by sale, they have an adequate remedy, and the measure of their damages, in their award of special damages. After all, the defendants did not behave arbitrarily or maliciously, nor even turn them out with nothing. The plaintiffs' earlier noted admissions of the defendants' servants good faith are relevant. The Act empowers seizure of not only the whole catch of fish, but also even the vessel itself. The defendants visely forbore. Moreover, the defendants extended the plaintiffs' licence term so that the plaintiffs could recoup the loss of the seizure though exploiting an extended time for continued fishing operation. Such a gesture can hardly be characterized as oppressive. No sound basis is presented here for the award of punitive damages.
