Muldoon, J.
: The plaintiffs claim the money-value which they allege they lost, as a result of confiscation by the defendants' servants and officials of saltfish, from the ship "Bordoyarnes" between November 12 to November 14, 1982. The defendants' servants seized 70 metric tonnes of saltfish, invoking s. 6(1)(b) of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. C-21.
