It remains only to deal with costs which will naturally follow the event in this case. The plaintiffs' counsel asks for costs on the scale of "a solicitor and his or her own client". He also asks to be permitted to recoup the costs awarded against the plaintiffs in the case of Canadian Saltfish Corporation v. Rasmussen, above mentioned. Needless to emphasize, the defendants' counsel opposes such a plea. This has, no doubt, been a long and difficult litigation but not inordinately so. One aspect of the case has been somewhat extraordinary and that is the distances which the plaintiff, Capt. Rasmussen has had to travel. He has needed the advice of his own lawyer from the Faroes, too, not only for advice in law but also to help him cope with litigation carried out in a language of which he possesses only imperfect command. The plaintiffs should therefore be compensated for their disbursement of those travel expenses necessarily incurred in, and necessarily incidental to, the plaintiffs' prosecution of their action. Included are such travel expenses incurred by, or for, Mr. Tormodur Djurhuus, who attended at the trial of this action in St. John's. If actual receipts or airline tickets, and hotel bills or taxi and meal receipts cannot all now be found and tendered, the parties' respective solicitors or, ultimately the taxing officer may take notice of air fares, hotel rates and the like which were generally in effect at the material times, in order to quantify such disbursements.
