The Legislature of Newfoundland has made statutory provision for prejudgment interest in the Judgment Interest Act, S.N. 1983, c. 81, which was accorded Royal Assent on December 21, 1983, and which was proclaimed to come into force on April 24, 1984, pursuant to Newfoundland regulation 63/84. The first question for determination is whether or not that Act applies in these circumstances. In that regard s. 10 is pertinent. It provides:
"10. This Act does not apply to a
cause of action
that arises
before
the coming into force of this Act, or to a judgment debt payable before the comimg into force of this Act."
