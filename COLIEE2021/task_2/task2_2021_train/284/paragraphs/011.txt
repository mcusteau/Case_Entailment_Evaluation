In the light of s. 6(6) recited above, one must wonder why the defendants pleaded in paragraph 4 of their statement of defence that their "servants at that time understood that there were legal impediments to accepting a bond". The answer came in the testimony of the defendants' witnesses Lawrence Wilfred Penney and Ernest William Collins. In 1980, the master of the French fishing vessel, "Joseph Roty II", was charged with an offence under the Fisheries Regulations, but released on bail bond in the amount of $25,000.00 and a recognizance. Because the master did attend at his trial, the recognizance and bond were voided, but the defendants' servants in that instance believed that the master's bail recognizance was a bond in lieu of the fish which they could have seized and were surprised to discover that it was, of course, no such thing. If the defendants' servants took advice in law, it would seem that even their adviser must have been negligent in order to impart the advice which caused them to believe that they could not accept a bond instead of seizing the fish. If it were necessary to do so, that negligence could and would be fixed to the defendants here, in view of the clear provisions of s. 6(6) of the Act.
