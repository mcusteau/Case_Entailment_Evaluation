When did the plaintiffs' cause of action arise? As the court has already held, the tort of conversion of the plaintiffs' property was committed when the defendants' declined to pay over to the plaintiffs the full monetary value of the plaintiffs' property and thereby wrongfully appropriated to Her Majesty the unpaid balance of such monetary value. According to s. 6(9) of the Coastal Fisheries Protection Act, the defendants' liability to pay over that full value could not arise until "the final conclusion of the proceedings" instituted "in respect of the offence". That conclusion of the proceedings occurred only upon the ending of all appeal proceedings, as was decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in Leblanc v. Curbera, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 28; 50 N.R. 237, at pp. 32 and 33 S.C.R.
