The court finds that the total sum of $143,858.39 is the full monetary value of the saltfish as and when removed from the plaintiffs' ship. This is the correct compensation to which they are entitled for the taking and conversion by sale of their fish. Of this sum they have already received $51,394.57, leaving due to them $92,463.82.
