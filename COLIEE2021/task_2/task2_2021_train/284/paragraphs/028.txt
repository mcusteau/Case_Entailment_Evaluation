The seized saltfish were sold through the Crown Assets Disposal Corporation to the Canadian Saltfish Corporation. According to s. 14(3) of the Saltfish Act, R.S.C. 1970 (1st Supp.), c. 37, as it then stood:
"14(3) Property acquired by the Corporation is the property of Her Majesty and title thereto may be vested in the name of Her Majesty or in the name of the Corporation."
Since s. 14(3) is not restricted only to real property and "property" is not so defined in this latter statute, it perforce extends to personal property, meaning the seized fish. Thus, it is shown that in effect, the Crown sold the plaintiffs' fish to the Crown. That was no open-market sale on tender. It is clear in the text of the Saltfish Act that the services of the Corporation would not have been needed if the fish had been sold only in the local market, for the Corporation's monopoly operates in inter-provincial and international transactions. In any event, the Crown dealt the fish to itself. That kind of dealing with the plaintiffs' property rendered the Crown akin to a trustee, perhaps a trustee de son tort, of the plaintiffs' property and its full monetary value. Authorities for the imposition of a fiduciary duty on the Crown, albeit in matters of equitable land claims, are Miller v. The King, [1950] S.C.R. 168, at pages 177 and 178, and Guerin et al. v. The Queen, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335; 55 N.R. 161. The principles of the Crown's equitable obligations enunciated in those high authorities are quite applicable in the circumstances of this case, at least in the sense that it is far from unthinkable that the Crown could indeed perpetrate the tort of wrongful conversion of the plaintiffs' property, by sale.
