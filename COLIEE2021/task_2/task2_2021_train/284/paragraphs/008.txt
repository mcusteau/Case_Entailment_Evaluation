The fate of the 70 tonnes of saltfish will be discussed later on herein, but first it is important to note the fate of the charge brought against Capt. Rasmussen. He went to trial, not before the District Court, but before the Provincial Court, on May 27, 1983. The trial endured for five days before His Honour Judge Seabright who delivered his oral reasons for judgment (transcribed, exhibit 5) on June 20, 1983. Judge Seabright found that the evidence about the "Bordoyarnes" position was unreliable and "that there is no one that shows where they actually crossed the boundary and when they were actually fishing". He also found that Capt. Rasmussen "took all the diligence that I can see that he was needed to do in order to show that he was not negligent in this matter ...". Judge Seabright concluded "... it would seem to me that on the basis of all this ... he is entitled to an acquittal on this matter, and I am going to so do at this particular time".
