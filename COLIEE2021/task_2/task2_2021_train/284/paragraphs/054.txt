The Act directs the court, in s. 3(1), to award interest on every "judgment for the payment of money or a judgment that money is owing ... on the judgment calculated in accordance with this Act". The commencement of the running of interest is not from the date on which the plaintiff notifies the defendant of the claim, or otherwise asserts it, but rather, according to the general direction of s. 4(1), "the court shall ... calculate interest under this Act from the day the cause of action arises to the day of judgment at the rate determined by averaging the interest rates in effect during that period". So be it. The plaintiffs' counsel alleges that the rate has always, pursuant to the Regulations, remained constant at 9% per annum. In any event, prejudgment interest is awarded in accordance with the provisions of the Judgment Interest Act and Regulations.
