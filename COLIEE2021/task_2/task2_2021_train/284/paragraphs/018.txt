The plaintiffs' plea of denial of reasonable bail without just cause in breach of paragraph 11(e) of the Charter was not supported by any evidence. The information and summons were completed on November 9, 1982. Capt. Rasmussen was before the Newfoundland Provincial Court on November 10 and 12. He pleaded "not guilty", and was told to return for trial in February 1983, later postponed to May 1983. The 70 tonnes of fish was offloaded from the ship on and between November 12 and 14 while Capt. Rasmussen was lodged in a hotel in or near St. John's. He was accorded an extension of his fishing licence to enable him to continue fishing until the end of November 1982 and the "Bordoyarnes" with master and crew set out to continue their fishing. They caught almost 70 tonnes and with a full load of about 388 to 390 tonnes they arrived at their port in the Faroes on or about December 8, 1982. Paragraph 11(e) of the Charter was neither infringed, nor denied.
