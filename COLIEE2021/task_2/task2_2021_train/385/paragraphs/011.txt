The applicant's claim had been originally rejected by the Department of Veterans Affairs, and an appeal from that decision to a review panel of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board was dismissed. There was no dispute about the primary facts relating to either the cause and extent of the applicant's injury, or the circumstances in which it occurred. However, these facts were found not to satisfy the statutory criterion of eligibility for pension purposes.
