In determining whether this finding was unreasonable I must also bear in mind Parliament's directive in the
Pension Act
that the legislation must be construed broadly in order to discharge Canada's obligation to compensate those members of the armed forces who have been disabled as a result of military service, and that any reasonable inference should be drawn from the evidence in favour of claimants. The similar, but not identical, wording of s. 3 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
must also be considered.
