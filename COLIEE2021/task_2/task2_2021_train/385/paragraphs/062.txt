Unlike workers' compensation legislation, pensions are payable under the
Pension Act
regardless of whether the claimant's injury resulted in loss of income. Rather, as s. 2 of the
Pension Act
and s. 3 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
make clear, the provisions dealing with pension entitlement are to be interpreted broadly, since they are a statutory recognition of the nation's debt to men and women who have been willing to put life and limb at risk in the service of their country, and to suffer the other inconveniences of a military career.
