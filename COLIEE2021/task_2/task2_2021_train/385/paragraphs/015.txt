This second decision of the Board is the subject of this application for judicial review. However, counsel for the applicant submitted that, in order better to understand the Board's reasoning, I should read its reasons for the decision under review together with those that it gave for its first decision, with the exception, of course, of that part of its original reasons that the Board subsequently disavowed.
