Counsel for the applicant argued that, since there were no primary facts in dispute in this case, the dispute centred on questions of law. By virtue of s. 18.1(4)(c) of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, the court has jurisdiction to set aside a decision of a federal tribunal, such as the Board, if it erred in law in making its decision. Consequently, it was for the court to determine for itself whether the applicant's injury "arose from" or was "directly connected with" military service, and if it found that it was, it should set aside the Board's decision as erroneous in law.
