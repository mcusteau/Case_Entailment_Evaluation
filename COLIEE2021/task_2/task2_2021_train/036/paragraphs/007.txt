  Section 2.7.3 of the  
 Guideline 
  provides that: 
 
 
 
 "Section R15(1)(b)(i) clearly states only that the onus is on the applicant to demonstrate that he/she has sufficient financial resources available to him/her for payment of tuition fees once in Canada. Tuition fees vary between jurisdictions, and may be as high as $10,000. Student authorizations may not, therefore, be refused to minors who do not present proof of payment of tuition fees. A student authorization may not, however, be issued unless the applicant provides a letter of acceptance from the appropriate educational authorities. The onus, therefore, is on the provinces, and not on CIC officers, to ensure their school boards and divisions include provisions for the payment of fees as a pre-condition to the issuance of acceptance letters." 
 
 
 
 Section 4.11.1 of the  
 Guideline 
  suggests that student authorizations for primary and secondary schooling usually be issued on a year-to-year basis.
