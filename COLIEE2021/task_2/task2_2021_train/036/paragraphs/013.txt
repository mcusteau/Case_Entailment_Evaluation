  The reasons of my colleague Gibson, J., in  
 Wong v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  [see footnote 8] are of interest in the context of the conclusion I have reached concerning the visa officer's finding that the applicants have no credible reasons for studying in Canada. While a question was certified in  
 Wong 
  and the matter is now pending before the Court of Appeal, Justice Gibson's views concerning the temporary purpose inherent in a student's visa issued for one year are worthy of repetition: 
 
 
 
 "Such an application is for permission for a clearly 'temporary purpose'. It is in the nature of student visas that they are issued for limited periods of time. If the minor applicant, together with his family, concluded in the future that he wished to continue to pursue his studies in Canada, a renewal of his visa or a new visa would be required. It would be open to the respondent to examine the totality of the circumstances each time that the minor applicant applied for renewal or a new visa. If, at any stage during the course of the minor applicant's education it became apparent that the minor applicant's ties to Hong Kong had so deteriorated as to demonstrate that they were insufficient to ensure his return there, then refusal of the request for renewal or for a new visa would clearly be justified." [see footnote 9] 
 
 
 
 This approach is consistent with the statute and its regulations. It also reinforces the directive to visa officers that in applying s. 9(1.2) of the  
 Act 
  [see footnote 10] "... the general question of bona fides is not so much whether the applicant is a prospective immigrant, but whether the applicant is a prospective illegal immigrant". [see footnote 11]
