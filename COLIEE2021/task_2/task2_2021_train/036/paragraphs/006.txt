  The applicants' material concerning the financing of their one-year academic stay in Canada was straightforward. Letters of acceptance for courses in grades 5 and 8 from their private school in Toronto establish partial payment of the $7,500 tuition fee for each student. A Canadian chartered bank confirmed that it held $10,000 in mutual fund investments for each child. The applicants' uncle and aunt who reside in Scarborough, Ontario undertook to provide all material support during their stay in Canada. The applicants have previously visited these relatives in Canada and would live with them while attending school here. The same chartered bank confirmed that it employed the uncle as an Account Manager-Commercial Banking at an annual salary of $43,300, not including bonuses. (The uncle deposed that the applicants also had term deposits with the chartered bank but the record discloses that these funds are in Indian rupees, not Canadian dollars.)
