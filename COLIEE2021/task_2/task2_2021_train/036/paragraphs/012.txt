  There are at least two serious concerns with the visa officer's finding concerning the absence of credible reasons for studying in Canada. Firstly, the record discloses no information concerning the availability and the quality of private schooling in India. Secondly, even if the visa officer had access to such information and she were correct with respect to India's private school system, she should have provided the applicants' family with an opportunity to address her concerns which are based on information not proffered by the applicants. Such a course of action is suggested in the  
 Guideline 
  in s. 2.7.4 dealing with the bona fides of minor students: 
 
 
 
 "If officers wish to take into account outside information, particularly where that information leads to concerns/doubts about the applicant's bona fides, they must be able to show that the applicant was made aware of the information taken into account and/or the concerns and was given an opportunity to address those concerns." 
 
 
 
 This directive properly, in my view, assigns to the visa officer the same duty of fairness in the assessment of student authorizations which the Court of Appeal imposed in reviewing applications for permanent residence. [see footnote 7] In this case, the visa officer chose to dispose of the applications without communicating with the applicants' family through an interview or otherwise concerning the information she obtained with respect to the quality and cost of private schooling in India.
