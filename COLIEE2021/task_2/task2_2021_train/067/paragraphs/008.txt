  In this case, the s. 30 appeal was brought within the required time limit but that part of the claim falling within the Court's judicial review jurisdiction is out of time and could only be saved by an order to extend time. Such an application to extend time was not brought before me and I am therefore left with a potentially meritorious claim which cannot be maintained in its present form. The only remaining question on this application is whether the failure by the CBSA Minister's delegate to render a timely decision with respect to the correctness of the border seizure is somehow fatal to the seizure and forfeiture of that money.
