  At the time of the seizure, the Plaintiff was returning to Canada with two acquaintances, namely Van Tai Nguyen and Wendy Nguyen. Mr. Nguyen was in possession of $5,000 (USD) and Ms. Nguyen had $2,400 (USD). All of the cash in the possession of the Plaintiff and the Nguyens was tested and found to be contaminated with cocaine residue. The Plaintiff told the customs officer that she had saved the funds in her possession and intended to use the money to buy diamonds in the United States. Because she had not found anything that suited her during her trip, she was returning to Canada with the money unspent. She said that the money was never deposited in a bank but was, rather, kept in her home. The funds were also in the form of $100 notes.
