 [9] 
  The issue before me is whether the time stipulated for a ministerial decision under s. 27(1) of the  
 Act 
  is mandatory or directory. That provision states: 
 
 
 
 "27(1) Within 90 days after the expiry of the period referred to in subsection 26(2), the Minister shall decide whether subsection 12(1) was contravened."
