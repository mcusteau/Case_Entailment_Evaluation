  I do not believe that the public interest or the important public policy concerns which underpin this legislation would be well-served by interpreting this time limit as mandatory and by declaring ministerial decisions made outside of the 90-day period to be a nullity. The potential return of the proceeds of serious crime to the bearer based upon the expiry of a relatively short statutory time requirement would create an anomalous situation of the sort described by Professor Mullan in the passage referred to in paragraph 16 above. If Parliament had intended such a result, such a penalty provision could easily have been written into the legislation and the absence of such a provision is an indication that Parliament had no intention of making the subject provision mandatory: see  
 McMahon 
  (Fed. Ct.), above, at paragraph 28.
