  This Court interpreted the word "shall" as directory in a similar statutory context in  
 McMahon v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [2004] F.C.J. No. 644; 252 F.T.R. 1; 2004 FC 540. There, Justice, J., Fran√ßois Lemieux examined a provision in the  
 Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act 
 , R.S. 1985, c. B-3, s. 1; 1992, c. 27, s. 2, which required the Superintendent of Bankruptcy to render a decision within three months after the conclusion of a hearing. After a thorough review of the case law, Justice Lemieux found the provision to be directory. In so doing, he identified three principal factors (at paragraph 27) to determine how this issue of interpretation should be resolved: 
 
 
 
 1. whether the duty being discharged is a public duty; 
 
 
 
 2. where lies the balance of inconvenience or prejudice; and 
 
 
 
 3. whether the statute provides for a penalty for failure to comply.
