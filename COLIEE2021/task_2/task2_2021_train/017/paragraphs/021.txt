  The Minister cites the decision of Nadon J., then of this Court, in Young v. Canada (1997) 138 F.T.R. 37 for the proposition that the burden lay upon Mrs. Dort to bring forth the facts which might support a favourable exercise of discretion. That is quite true, but does not assist in this case. In Young, the pertinent facts were within the knowledge and control of the taxpayer. In this case, the facts relating to the delays in investigating the partnership and in processing the tax return are within the exclusive knowledge of the Minister, not the taxpayer.
