  Mrs. Dort has also sought a waiver of interest based on the fact that she was unable to conclude a reasonable payment arrangement. Section 7 of the Guidelines provides: 
 
 
 
 7. It may be appropriate, in circumstances where there is an inability to pay amounts owing, to consider waiving or cancelling interest in all or in part to facilitate collection. For example, 
 
 
 
 (a) When collection has been suspended due to an inability to pay. 
 
 
 
 (b) When a taxpayer is unable to conclude a reasonable payment arrangement because the interest charges absorb a significant portion of the payments. In such a case, consideration may be given to waiving interest in all or in part for the period from when payments commence until the amounts owing are paid provided the agreed payments are made on time.
