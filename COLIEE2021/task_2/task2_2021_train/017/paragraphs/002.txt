  When Raymond Dort died in 2001, he had a piece of outstanding litigation with the Minister. In 1987, he invested in a partnership and claimed a business loss on his tax return, a loss which was eventually disallowed. Like many other investors in the partnership, he appealed to the Tax Court. His lawyers proposed, and it was agreed, that his case, and others, be left in abeyance pending the outcome of a test case. In that test case the Tax Court ruled in favour of the Minister. An appeal therefrom to the Federal Court of Appeal was pending at the time of Mr. Dort's death. A few months later, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the Tax Court (King v. Canada, [2001] D.T.C. 5116; [2001] 1 C.T.C. 295; [2001] F.C.J. No. 56 (QL)).
