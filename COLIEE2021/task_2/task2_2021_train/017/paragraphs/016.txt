  The fact of the matter is that, as has been admitted in this Court, the initial decision of J.F. Lee was limited to financial hardship and mental distress. The delay-in-processing issue was covered in April 2002 by the Department which sent the Estate's solicitors a "duplicate" unsigned copy of a letter dated 22 October 2001, purportedly issued by T.A. Wright, Assistant Director, Client Service Division. That letter denied the application as regards the delay in processing. However, that letter had never been reviewed by Mr. Wright or put to him for his signature. Thus, there was no first level decision for Mr. Gibson to review.
