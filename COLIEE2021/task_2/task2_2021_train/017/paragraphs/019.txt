  The decision as regards delays in processing is also unreasonable in the manner in which Mr. Gibson took inspiration from a memorandum from the Kitchener-Waterloo office, dated 5 September 2002, which dealt with Fairness requests with respect to unreasonable delays concerning another partnership, the Mainstream Productions Partnership. Mr. Gibson followed the decision in that case that there was an unreasonable delay caused by the rescheduling of the hearing at the Federal Court of Appeal in the King test case, because there were no appeal books available for the judges. Mr. Gibson, in like manner, waived interest from 29 May 2000 to 25 January 2001. However, he did not have before him a number of exhibits referred to in the memorandum including the Kitchener Audit chronological sequence of file completion, and appeals diary. The memorandum stated that the Kitchener office had found there were no unreasonable delays at the audit and objection stages in the Mainstream Productions Partnership; yet Mr. Gibson did not pull the appropriate Halifax files in order to make the same analysis with respect to the partnership in question "Records International". Furthermore, the Mainstream Productions Partnership memorandum stated that investors would have been aware that they had a balance outstanding of the objection stage but added: "check if Appeals sent an "Acknowledgement Letter" to the taxpayer explaining that the interest continued to accrue on the balance in dispute". Mr. Gibson made no such check.
