  The Registrar found that the available evidence clearly failed to show any use of the TARGET APPAREL mark in Canada in association with the registered wares during the relevant period, which the Registrar identified as the six month period between Fairweather's acquisition of the mark in October of 2001, and the issuance of the s. 45 Notice in April of 2002. Thus the issue for the Registrar was whether the evidence established that the absence of use was due to "special circumstances" excusing non-use.
