 [51] 
  The respondent questions whether the use of the TARGET APPAREL mark by International Clothiers Inc. can be attributed to Fairweather, in the absence of there having been a formal licence agreement between the two companies that would trigger the deeming provisions of s. 50(1) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 . This subsection deems use of a mark by a licensee to be use by the registered owner, provided that the owner has direct or indirect control over the character or quality of the wares in question.
