  Mr. Brener further deposed that because Fairweather stores do not sell men's clothing, it was anticipated that TARGET APPAREL merchandise would be licensed to, and sold through, a related menswear company. According to Mr. Brener, it was anticipated that TARGET APPAREL brand merchandise (namely suits, pants, jackets and coats) would be re-launched in Canada in the Fall of 2002, or early in 2003. To this end, Mr. Brener stated that they were in the process of developing labelling and sourcing products to be sold in connection with what he described as "this valuable brand".
