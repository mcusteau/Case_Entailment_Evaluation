  A review of Mr. Brener's first affidavit discloses a general intention to re-launch TARGET APPAREL brand merchandise, namely suits, pants, jackets and coats, and I have already found, based upon the new evidence, that concrete steps were in fact taken prior to the issuance of the s. 45 Notice to achieve this goal, with the result that the appeal should be allowed.
