At this point an obvious impasse arose. The Tribunal pressed forward and scheduled a public meeting to hear additional evidence pertaining to the election appeal. Unfortunately, the Tribunal neglected to inform legal counsel for Sweetgrass about the public meeting and he was naturally perturbed by that oversight. For its part, the Tribunal's attempts to post notices of this meeting met with some resistance and when it did attempt to convene the meeting, it was served with the interim injunction which was issued by this Court on December 16, 2005.
