The fact that the
Act
does not expressly deal with every potential situation of disqualifying conflict for appointees to the Tribunal does not implicitly authorize the appointment of any person who is not expressly prohibited from so acting. Given the size of the Sweetgrass Band and the close familial, business and friendship bonds that exist in such an environment, some degree of common sense and flexibility is undoubtedly required in making choices of this kind: see
Sparvier
, above, at paragraph 64 et seq. On the other hand, there will be persons with perceived or actual vested interests in the outcome of a Band election who cannot sit on the Tribunal, even though the
Act
does not precisely describe the particular circumstances of conflict or bias that have allegedly arisen.
