Sweetgrass has raised a number of technical challenges to the appointment of Ms. Gollan and Mr. Paskemin by the previous Band Council. Those challenges involve an alleged failure to fully or correctly document the appointment decisions and a failure to meet at least one of the timing requirements set out in the
Act
. The latter concern involves the obvious failure by the Band Council to appoint Ms. Gollan as Tribunal Chair not less than ninety (90) days in advance of the election, as stipulated in the
Act
. Here the appointment decision pertaining to Ms. Gollan was made eighty-eight (88) days before the scheduled election at the Council's election declaration meeting held on August 18, 2005. Mr. Paskemin was appointed even later to replace Ms. Weenie who in turn had replaced Fred Paskemin who had resigned.
