The appointment of a new Chair to replace Ms. Gollan is the responsibility of the current Band Council. While Mr. Pelton is undoubtedly well-qualified, fair-minded and impartial, it may be that the Chief and Council will, as their legal counsel argued before me, decide to take a completely fresh approach to the replacement decision. That is properly a political choice which will presumably be made in the best interests of maintaining the integrity of the electoral process. If the decision is made in a way that would run counter to the principles which I have addressed in the situation of Ms. Gollan, any aggrieved party would have the right to seek judicial recourse once again.
