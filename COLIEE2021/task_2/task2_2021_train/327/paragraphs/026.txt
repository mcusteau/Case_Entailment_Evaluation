It is on the basis of an allegation of bias that the newly elected Chief and Band Council for Sweetgrass now seek to remove Ms. Gollan from the Tribunal to be replaced by a representative they have chosen, namely Mr. Pelton. They also seek to replace Mr. Paskemin with Ms. Weenie on the basis that the earlier Council decision to remove her was irregular. Ms. Gollan and Mr. Paskemin have refused to step down as members of the Tribunal, and they deny that they are disqualified for bias or for reasons of irregularity in their initial appointments. They contend that they were duly authorized to act in this capacity in strict conformity with the
Act
. They also assert that this proceeding is an attempt by the newly elected Chief and Council to inappropriately usurp the governance authority of the previous Council. The underlying concern of the Defendants is, of course, that such a process could be motivated by a desire to exert some indirect influence over the pending election appeal.
