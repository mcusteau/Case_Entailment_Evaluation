Another entry for August 25, 2005 indicates that Ms. Gollan and Chief Atcheynum discussed the appropriateness of his brother sitting as a member of the Tribunal. The entry indicates that Ms. Gollan appropriately cautioned about the need to maintain impartiality.
Issues
1. Are either of Ms. Gollan or Mr. Paskemin disqualified from sitting as members of the Tribunal on the basis of irregularities in their respective appointments?
2. Is Ms. Gollan disqualified from sitting as a member of the Tribunal on the basis of bias?
3. What is the appropriate remedy, if any?
4. What order for costs should be made?
