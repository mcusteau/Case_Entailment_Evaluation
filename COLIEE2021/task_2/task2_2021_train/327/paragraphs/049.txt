The Courts have been rigorous in applying the test for bias to situations involving the existence of a meaningful pecuniary interest on the part of a delegate sitting in judgment of a dispute. This point is made by Jones and de Villars in
Principles of Administrative Law
(4th Edition) in the following passage at page 373:
"The courts have consistently held that the existence of a direct financial interest in the outcome of the matter in dispute almost always disqualifies a statutory delegate from acting. In other words, a pecuniary interest gives rise to a 'reasonable apprehension of bias', no matter how open-minded in fact the delegate might be."
