When Ms. Gollan was appointed to the Tribunal, she was also under retainer from Sweetgrass to act as its legal counsel. In that latter capacity, she had provided extensive legal services and her accounts for 2005 were placed before me as part of the Record. A review of those legal accounts rendered by Ms. Gollan to Sweetgrass leading up to the Band election indicates that she also provided legal advice to Chief Atcheynum in his personal capacity. This included the joint representation of Chief Atcheynum and Sweetgrass in litigation against a number of third parties, including Battlefords Tribal Council. While it is clear that Ms. Gollan did not have primary carriage of that litigation on behalf of Sweetgrass and Chief Atcheynum, she does acknowledge in her affidavit that her role was considerably larger than acting as a mere local agent for lead counsel. In fact, she is named as one of the counsel of record for the legal proceeding, albeit in a subordinate capacity. Ms. Gollan billed Sweetgrass directly for this legal work and her legal fees for this litigation constitute a significant percentage of the total fees for 2005 charged to Sweetgrass.
