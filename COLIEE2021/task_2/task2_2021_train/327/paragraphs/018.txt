Shortly after the election, Ms. Gollan's retainer as legal counsel to the Band was terminated. On November 22, 2005, Ms. Gollan was informed that the incoming Band Council had removed her as Tribunal Chair to be replaced by Robert Pelton, Q.C. While Ms. Gollan agreed to transfer carriage of her files as legal counsel to the Band to the newly appointed legal counsel, she declined to withdraw from her role as Tribunal Chair. She pointed out that the Tribunal "operates independently of Band Chief and Council", and that the incoming Chief and Council had no authority to rescind her appointment made by the previous Chief and Council.
