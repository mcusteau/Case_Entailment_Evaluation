Some effort has been taken to ensure the independence of members of the Tribunal. For example, the Tribunal Chair must be a solicitor but cannot be an elector or the spouse or immediate family member of an elector. A preference for selecting elders to the other two Tribunal positions is stated. Although the desire for independence, objectivity and fairness by the Tribunal is clearly evident, the
Act
does not purport to exhaustively identify all potential situations of conflict in the selection of its members. Furthermore, the
Act
is completely silent with respect to the problem encountered here, which is how the Band should deal with an allegation of bias on the part of a Tribunal member and where that member declines to step down. The
Act
is also silent in dealing with the issue of replacing a member of the Tribunal or an electoral officer who may decide to withdraw or who is placed in a position of conflict by the later nomination of a family member to run for election.
