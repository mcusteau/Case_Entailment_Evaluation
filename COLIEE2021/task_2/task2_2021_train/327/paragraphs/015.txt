The above-noted BCR went on to purportedly remove the Defendants, Lori Gollan and Myron Paskemin, as Tribunal members and to replace them respectively with Robert Pelton, Q.C. (a respected and well-known lawyer from Regina), and with the aforementioned Sylvia Weenie. It is noteworthy that there is no evidence in the Record that Ms. Weenie, or anyone else, objected to her removal as a member of the Tribunal at the time she was replaced by Myron Paskemin, and there is no indication from her as to whether she was prepared to accept re-appointment to the Tribunal pursuant to the above-referenced Council resolution.
