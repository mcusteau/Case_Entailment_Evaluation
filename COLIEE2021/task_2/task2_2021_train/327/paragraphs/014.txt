Because of Ms. Weenie's close family connection with two (2) of the election candidates, Band Council appointed Myron Paskemin in her stead as a member of the Tribunal. That decision was purportedly made by a Council resolution passed at a meeting on November 8, 2005 but no signed copy of the Band Council Resolution (BCR) was located in the Band Office. A signed copy of the November 8, 2005 BCR was, however, provided by Ms. Gollan on November 29, 2005. The fact that Ms. Weenie was replaced as a Tribunal member is also verified in the recitals to a BCR executed by the current Chief and Council on November 18, 2005. That BCR recital states in part:
"AND WHEREAS by resolution made 18 Aug 2005, the Chief and Council of Sweetgrass First Nation resolved to appoint Fred Paskimin [sic] as elector to sit on the election tribunal.
"AND WHEREAS on 19 Aug 2005, Fred Paskiman [sic] declined his appointment as elector to sit on the election tribunal.
"AND WHEREAS by resolution made 19 Aug 2005 the Chief and Council of Sweetgrass First Nation resolved to appoint Sylvia Weenie as elector to sit on the election tribunal.
"
AND WHEREAS on 8 Nov 2005, the Chief and Council of Sweetgrass First Nation resolved to appoint Myron Paskunin [sic] as a second elector to sit on the election tribunal
