The need to maintain a perception of fairness in the face of prior professional or family relationships or rivalries is described by Professor Mullan in his text
Administrative Law
(2001) at page 330:
"Whatever the uncertainties as to the meaning and application of the test for bias, there are many situations where disqualification is almost inevitably going to occur. Adjudicating in cases involving close friends, personal enemies, business associates, and rivals, not to mention family members, provide clear, though nowadays infrequent examples. Indeed, the rules of many tribunals contain codes identifying relationships of this kind that are either disqualifying or at the very least have to be declared."
