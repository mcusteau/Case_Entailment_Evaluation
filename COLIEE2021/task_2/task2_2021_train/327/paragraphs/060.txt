Notwithstanding Ms. Gollan's unsuccessful defence to the Band's claim against her, I think that the same principles favouring complete indemnity should be applied in her favour. She took on the role of Tribunal Chair at the request of the Band Council and adopted a principled, albeit unmeritorious, position in defence to the allegations brought against her. The Council that appointed her was well aware of the particulars of her professional relationship with it officers and with Sweetgrass. Sweetgrass must bear responsibility for the decision made on its behalf. Inasmuch as Ms. Gollan and the other Defendants were represented by one counsel throughout, it is doubtful that any additional legal costs will be payable by the Band beyond what would be payable in any event to the other two Defendants. The award of costs in favour of Ms. Gollan is subject to one caveat. In her case alone, it will be subject to her obligation to repay to the Band any monies received by her as a retainer to act in her capacity as Tribunal Chair. The Record indicates that she received one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) as a retainer to act in that capacity, and to my mind it would be inappropriate for her to retain those funds in addition to the indemnity which she will receive for her legal costs.
