I do not think that the simple involvement of a lawyer in Ms. Gollan's firm in the swearing of affidavits on behalf of the party appealing the election would, standing alone, justify Ms. Gollan's removal from the Tribunal. However, there is an obvious need to scrupulously protect the impartiality of the Tribunal, and anything that detracts from the appearance of objectivity is undesirable. When considered with the other concerns of perception noted above, this, too, becomes an added basis for Ms. Gollan's removal.
