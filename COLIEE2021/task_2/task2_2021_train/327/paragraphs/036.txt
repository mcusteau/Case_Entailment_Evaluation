Finally, I also do not accept that this challenge to Mr. Paskemin's right to continue as a member of the Tribunal is a basis for concern that he could not fairly carry out his responsibilities. Such an argument would disqualify any member of a tribunal simply because his right to sit was legally challenged. There can be no such basis for removing a member of an adjudicative body absent evidence of disqualifying bias. Here there was no evidence offered that Mr. Paskemin was biased, and there is no basis whatsoever for removing him from the Tribunal.
