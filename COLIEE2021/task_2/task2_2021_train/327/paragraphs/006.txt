A key component of the election appeal process is the appointment of the Tribunal which has the authority to conduct an investigation into an election and to prepare a report to the Band Council outlining its findings. The
Act
also contemplates a formal public hearing to be convened by the Tribunal after it has completed its own internal investigation. At that hearing, the Tribunal is directed to "hear and consider all manner of evidence that it deems relevant to the appeal". Thereafter, the
Act
requires the Tribunal to meet and to make an appropriate recommendation to the Chief and Council. Where the Tribunal finds that the election of a candidate or candidates has been tainted by corruption, by a material irregularity or by ineligibility, its findings are binding upon the Chief and Council (Article 4 N(5)). In such circumstances, a re-election is required. Needless to say, the authority of the Tribunal to effectively declare a Band election to be invalid confers upon it a daunting and significant responsibility.
