 [8] 
  Had the Officer relied on extrinsic evidence to refute a specific allegation or component of the applicants' evidence, as was the case in  
 Mark v Canada (MCI) 
 , 2009 FC 364, fairness may require that it be disclosed. This is not the case in the present application. The documents in question contain non-contentious information regarding general country conditions, including the education system, government and economy. The evidence merely provided context for the Officer's analysis. Accordingly, there is no breach of procedural fairness.
