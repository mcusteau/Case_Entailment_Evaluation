  The applicants submit that the Officer erred by failing to follow the approach set out by Justice James Russell in  
 Williams v Canada (MCI) 
 , 2012 FC 166. Justice Russell determined that an officer must first identify what is in the child's best interests and then consider the degree to which the child's interests would be compromised by one outcome over another. In  
 Williams 
 , the officer applied the wrong test, namely whether the child would experience disproportionate or undeserved hardship. This concept is inapplicable to children, who would rarely if ever be deserving of hardship. Therefore, Justice Russell considered it necessary to provide a detailed template for use on reconsideration.
