  It is unnecessary for an officer to disclose publicly available documents unless they contain novel information or show a change in country conditions that may affect the decision:  
 Mancia v Canada (MCI) 
 , [1998] 3 FC 461 (CA), paras 26-27. Though  
 Mancia 
  involved a risk assessment, the principle applies equally in the case of H&C decisions:  
 Jiang v Canada (MCI) 
 , 2010 FC 580, para 29-30;  
 Hernandez v Canada (MCI) 
 , 2011 FC 1301, para 16. As Justice Michel Beaudry explained in  
 Jiminez v Canada (MCI) 
 , 2010 FC 1078, at paragraph 19, though the applicants may not have read the specific reports at issue, the information contained therein is widely available and would have been easy for the applicants to locate.
