  Dr. Pilowsky was not asked why it would be re-traumatizing to require the applicant to return to a part of Mexico where he had not experienced persecution. Perhaps she did not consider this possibility because it was not put specifically to her. Or perhaps she would say that, even though the applicant only experienced persecution in Mexico City, his belief that he was being sought by the police when he was in Toluca is likely to cause him to associate the traumatizing stressor with any of the judicial forces, whether state or federal. Moreover, his evidence that he fears the national authorities, and believes that the influence of corrupt officials extends through the PRI to the local government level, also suggests that the psychological source of his stress may not be confined to Mexico City.
