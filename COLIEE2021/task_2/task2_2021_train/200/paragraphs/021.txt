  It is true that in some cases a visa officer will have a duty to put his concerns to an applicant. However, after having reviewed the cases where such a duty was found to exist, Justice Richard Mosley explained in  
 Hassani v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 1283, [2007] 3 FCR 501, at para 24, that "...it is clear that where a concern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns." (See also, e.g.,  
 Roberts v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 518 at para 20 and the cases cited there for applications of that principle).
