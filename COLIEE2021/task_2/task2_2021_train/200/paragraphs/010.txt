 [10] 
  On July 19, 2010 Shu Chen wrote the Immigration Section of the Canadian Embassy in Beijing a letter in which he cited the definition of "educational credential" in the  
 Regulations 
  and conceded that although the Correspondence Institute of Party School of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China provides a post-secondary education program to party members, government officers and other "normal" citizens, it does not belong to the National Education System and hence is not an institution that can be certified by Cadgedc. This letter was included with the August 4, 2010 application.
