 Harrington, J. 
 : The applicants seek an advantage because they were not represented by counsel when they applied for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA). They submit that the PRRA officer had a duty to lead them through the process by the hand and that the guideline issued by Citizenship and Immigration Canada was incomplete and misguiding. I disagree.
