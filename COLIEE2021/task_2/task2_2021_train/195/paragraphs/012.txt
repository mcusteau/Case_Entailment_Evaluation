  Reliance was placed on the decision of Mr. Justice Oâ€™Reilly in Nemeth v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCT 590, [2003] F.C.J. No. 776 (QL). The facts of that case were quite different. Mr. Nemeth had a lawyer who was unable to attend the hearing before the Immigration and Refugee Board, but who requested an adjournment. Nevertheless, Mr. Nemeth appeared alone before the Board and said he had no need for counsel. During the hearing it became evident that Mr. Nemeth did not understand what he had to do and it was too late to correct the shortcomings. The application for judicial review was allowed, because although Mr. Nemeth had not been abandoned by counsel and had waived his right to be represented by counsel, he did not receive a fair hearing as the Board had been aware that he had been represented until the last minute, and should have been alive to the risk that he was ill-prepared to represent himself. That is not the situation here. The Agris were unrepresented from the outset.
