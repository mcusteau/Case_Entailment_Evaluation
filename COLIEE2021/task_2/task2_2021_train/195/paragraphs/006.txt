  The issue is whether the PRRA officer had a positive duty to explain to the applicants that since the evidence they presented did not arise after the rejection of the refugee claim, they had an obligation to explain why it was not reasonably available or why they could not reasonably have been expected to present it to the Board. If the answer is in the affirmative, they were denied a fair hearing, and are entitled to a new one. It is not for the Court to surmise what the outcome might have been had the officer taken this evidence into account. (Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643).
