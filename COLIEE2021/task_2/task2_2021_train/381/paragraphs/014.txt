The appellant submits that the mark shown on the invoices and on the labels, which the affiant declares is seen on the pieces of clothing, ties and foulards, does not show the mark as registered. The registered mark consists of the words "Vitaliano Pancaldi" with a V design surrounded by a white rectangle. Exhibit B contains two photocopies of labels. The first photocopy is a mark which appears taken from a dark cloth label but without the rectangle. The second photocopy does show the label as registered. But in the appellant's opinion the mark in the second photocopy is in Italian and consequently cannot demonstrate that the trademark was in use in Canada, to which submission I do not agree.
