[27]
I am satisfied that the Registrar did not commit any reviewable error in finding that the photocopies are apt to show use of a trademark, in finding that the labels were not substantially different and that the "pocket scarf" is a foulard. I am also satisfied and I concur with the Registrar's finding that the evidence adduced by way of affidavit clearly shows use of the trademark as registered with wares in Canada as required by s. 45 of the
Act
. In my view, the court should be reluctant to reverse the finding of the Registrar unless I am satisfied the Registrar erred, that is to say, come to a wrong conclusion on the facts.
