As mentioned above, the only element missing is the rectangular shape around the words and V design. In my view, this issue is whether the mark represented without the rectangle is substantially different from the registered trademark. The Registrar considered the deviation minor and not apt to deceive or cause injury on the part of unaware purchasers. I am satisfied the Registrar applied the proper test in determining whether the mark represented without the rectangle was substantially different from the mark as registered. This test was stated by Mr. Justice Pratte in
Compagnie Internationale pour l'Information CIL Honeywell Bull v. Registrar of Trademarks
, [1985] 1 F.C. 406; 61 N.R. 286 (F.C.A.), at pages 408-409:
"The problem to be resolved is not whether CII deceived the public as to the origin of its goods. It clearly did not. The real and only question is whether, by identifying its goods as it did, CII made use of its trademark 'Bull'. That question must be answered in the negative unless the mark was used in such a way that the mark did not loose its identity and remained recognizable in spite of the differences between the form in which it was registered and the form in which it was used. The practical test to be applied in order to resolve a case of this nature is to compare the trademark as it is registered with the trademark as it is used and determine whether the differences between these two marks are so unimportant that an unaware purchaser would be likely to infer that both, in spite of their differences, identify goods having the same origin."
