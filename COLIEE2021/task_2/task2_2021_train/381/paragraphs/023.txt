And last, but not least, is the issue of whether a pocket scarf is a foulard. To make this determination, I would refer to the
Oxford English Dictionary
, 2nd Ed., vol. VI, at page 118, where "foulard" is defined as follows:
1. A thin flexible material of silk or of silk mixed with cotton.
2. A handkerchief of this material.
In vol. XI, at page 1110, "pocket-handkerchief" is defined as a handkerchief carried in the pocket. And in vol. XIV, at 590, "scarf" is defined as a "broad strip of silk, gauze hung loosely over the shoulders or otherwise as an ornamental accessory to the costume" and as a "band of warm and soft material worn round the neck in cold weather".
