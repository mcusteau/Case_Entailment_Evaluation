In response to these proceedings, the respondent filed the affidavit of Mrs. Ziosi and Exhibits A and B in support thereof, dated August 27, 1996. Further to this appeal, the respondent filed the respondent's record without any supplementary evidence. Therefore, the affidavit of Mrs. Ziosi, sworn to on August 27, 1996 with exhibits attached thereto, is the only evidence which was before the Registrar and for consideration before this court.
