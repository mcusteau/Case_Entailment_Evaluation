I disagree with the appellant's interpretation of this case. I think the better view is that in such proceedings the owner of a trademark has the onus to adduce evidence sufficient to demonstrate the use of a registered trademark in association with the wares pursuant to s. 45(1) of the
Trade-marks Act
. In my view, the owner has a duty to lead the best evidence as to the use of the trademark in Canada:
Thomas & Betts Ltd. v. Panduit Corp.
(1997), 129 F.T.R. 272; 74 C.P.R.(3d) 185 (T.D.), at 200-201, but it does not follow that evidence in the form of photocopies will result in an invalid registration. The only issue is whether the evidence shows use of the trademark as registered in Canada.
