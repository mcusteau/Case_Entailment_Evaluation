  The Citizenship Judge in the case before me did not do a proper verification of the absences and, as a result, did not raise the issue with the respondent, ask for an explanation and necessarily did not determine the materiality or significance of the discrepancy. As I see it, in this case, as Denault, J., held in  
 Jabsheh 
 , the Citizenship Judge erred in assessing the evidence.
