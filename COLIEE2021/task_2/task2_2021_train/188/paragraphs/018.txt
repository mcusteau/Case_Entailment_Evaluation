  Counsel for the Minister says that an examination of the respondent's passport entries and exits demonstrates the respondent on some occasions was outside of Canada when he said, in his citizenship application, he was present in Canada. Counsel for the Minister cited a recent decision of my colleague, Denault, J., in  
 Canada (Ministre de la Citoyennet√© et de l'Immigration) v. Jabsheh 
 , [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 62; [1999] F.C.J. No. 147, court file T-1592-98, February 2, 1999. Denault, J., expressed himself as follows: 
 
 
 
 "[4] First, a review of the calculation of the days of absence in the document submitted by the respondent reveals that the total absences are 349 days rather than 339 days. Moreover, a check of the respondent's passport indicates that, in preparing his list of absences from Canada, he failed to indicate some trips, including a trip to Zurich, Switzerland on May 15, 1994 to the United States on May 20, 1994, to France on October 25 and 28, 1994 and to Belgium on April 20, 1996. According to the list of absences provided by the respondent, all these trips took place when he was supposed to be in Canada. The court can only conclude that the respondent overlooked reporting or intentionally reduced his days of absence. A simple passport check by the Citizenship Judge would have revealed the error. 
 
 
 
 "[5] In the case at bar, insofar as the respondent did not prove in his citizenship application that he satisfied the residence requirements set out by the  
 Act 
 , and since the Citizenship Judge erred in assessing the evidence, the appeal should be allowed."
