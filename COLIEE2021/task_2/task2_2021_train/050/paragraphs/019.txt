  I am of the opinion that the visa officer made reviewable errors in failing to make further inquiries and in failing to apprise the applicant of his belief before deciding that the documents were not credible. This is consistent with the jurisprudence in Huyen v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] F.C.J. No. 1267 (T.D.), 2001 FCT 904, where Lemieux J. stated at paragraph 5: 
 
 
 
 Moreover, the visa officer rejected documentary evidence proving she had worked as a cook in a restaurant in Vietnam because it was not on letterhead and was handwritten. I find that a rejection of documentary proof on this basis, without more verification to be unreasonable.
