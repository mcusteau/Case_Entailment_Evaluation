  The visa officer was concerned that two of the letters provided by the applicant quoted directly from the duties listed in NOC 3214 (clinical perfusionist). As a result, the visa officer decided that the documents were not credible, nor was the applicant's training and work experience. While it is true that the visa officer did raise some concerns about the applicant's training and experience at the interview, he did not give the applicant an opportunity to respond to his specific concerns about the veracity of the letters, nor did he make further inquiries to determine whether or not the letters were valid. The cross-examination of the visa officer established that he was not certain that the certification stamp on the letters applied only to the translation. The issue of the certification on the letters should have been verified.
