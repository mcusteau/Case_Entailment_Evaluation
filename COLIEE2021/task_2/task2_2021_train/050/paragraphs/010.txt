  The respondent submits that it was reasonably open to the visa officer to refuse the applicant's application for permanent residence. It is submitted that the visa officer was not satisfied the applicant had performed the duties of a clinical perfusionist based on several factors, including the fact the applicant provided no mark sheets confirming his training and the fact that the letters of reference outlining his duties reproduced the terms of the NOC word for word. As such, the respondent submits that it was reasonably open to the visa officer to question the credibility of the letters and consequently, the applicant's training and work experience. The respondent submits that under the circumstances the visa officer was not obliged to make further inquiries since he had advised the applicant that he had concerns about his training and experience and the applicant was given an opportunity to address these concerns.
