The type of order sought by Mr. X can be found in paragraph 19 of his affidavit which reads as follows:
"19. I seek from this Honourable Court an Order directing the Minister of National Defence to provide in writing to the applicant and to the Information Commissioner of Canada a detailed explanation as to why his Department failed to respond within the time limits set out in the Act and what remedies will be undertaken by his Department so as to try to prevent the repetition of such a situation in the future. I would also seek from this Honourable Court a judgment which would indicate that the Minister of National Defence is deemed to have refused to give access to records by reason of s. 10(3) of the
Access to Information Act
."
