The instant application was filed on June 2, 1989, on the following two grounds: (1) the Minister of National Defence failed to give access to records within the time limits set out in the Act, and (2) even though access was given to part of the records requested on February 17th, 1989, the failure to give access by December 10th, 1988, should be deemed a "refusal" under s. 10(3) of the Act.
