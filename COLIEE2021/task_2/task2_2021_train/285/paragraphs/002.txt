The essential facts are as follows. On August 12, 1988, Mr. X submitted a request for certain Department of National Defence records concerning one Herbert Osborne Yardley, an individual involved in establishing the Canadian Cryptographic Bureau in 1941. On September 6, 1988, Mr. X was informed by the department that a 90 day extension of the statutory time limit of 30 days normally required for processing requests would be necessary, pursuant to s. 9(1)(b) of the Act, as outside consultation was called for. No response having been received by January 25, 1989, Mr. X made inquiries and was informed that the department was still processing his request. He finally received the requested records on February 27, 1989, that is more than six months after his submission and more than two months after the expiry of the 90 day extension.
