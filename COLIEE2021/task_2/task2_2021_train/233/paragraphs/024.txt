Canadian criminal law provides the same maximum sentence for the offence of conspiracy to possess drugs for the purpose of trafficking as it does for trafficking itself: life imprisonment. The fact that s. 36(1) of the
IRPA
characterizes as serious criminality an offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of at least 10 years, combined with the remarks of the Supreme Court concerning the seriousness of drug-trafficking related offences (see in particular
Delisle v. Canada (Department of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] F.C.J. No. 977; 2002 FCT 737, at paragraph 13), can only lead me to find that the offence for which the applicant was convicted is a serious non-political crime.
