The argument regarding the evidence of good conduct that the applicant claims he never had an opportunity to make is unfounded, and he did not offer any reference in support of this. The existence of this right, which the applicant claims to have, has not been established. The Refugee Protection Division is not an appropriate forum for deciding the merits of the severity of a sentence issued abroad against a refugee claimant, or for deciding whether a person has demonstrated good conduct following his release. In this case the applicant committed a serious non-political crime, was convicted of that crime and has not finished serving his sentence. These facts give rise to the application of the exclusion under section F(b).
