In
Zrig v. Canada (Ministesr of Citizenship and Immigration)
, supra, the Federal Court of Appeal explained the appropriate scope of section F(b). In that case, Nadon, J.A., conducted a detailed review of the cases and authorities on this question. At paragraphs 59 to 97, he explains the meaning of section F(b). In particular, at paragraphs 59 and 79, he writes (explanations omitted):
"[59] In the appellant's submission, the intention of the signatories of the
Convention
was to ensure that persons committing non-political crimes could not avoid extradition proceedings, criminal prosecution or the execution of a sentence of imprisonment in their countries by seeking refugee status in a third country.
. . . . .
"[79] ...
The only question that must be answered is whether there are serious reasons for considering that a claimant committed a serious non-political crime.
" (Emphasis added)
The Canadian courts consider drug trafficking to be a serious non-political crime (see in particular
Delisle v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] F.T.R. Uned. 483; 2002 FCT 737; [2002] F.C.J. No. 977, at paragraph 13). In the case at bar, the applicant was not convicted of drug trafficking, but rather of possession with intent to distribute 325 kilograms of marijuana.
