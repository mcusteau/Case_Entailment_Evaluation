  In my view, section 3 of the  
 Pension Act 
  means that an applicant would have a disability if his or her ability to hear was lessened or lost. Section 9.01 on the other hand, only permits a disability to be established if certain levels of hearing loss are established. This is inconsistent with the definition of disability in the  
 Pension Act 
  which provides that an applicant has a disability if his or her ability to hear is lessened.
