 Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport and Minister of Fisheries and Oceans) 
 , [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3; 132 N.R. 321; 88 D.L.R.(4th) 1, at paragraph 42). It was therefore submitted that the  
 Pension Act 
  must prevail over the Table of Disabilities in cases of conflict.
