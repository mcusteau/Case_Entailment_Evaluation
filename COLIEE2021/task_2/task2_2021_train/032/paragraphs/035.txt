  As noted, the Applicant relies on  
 Mr. Submarine 
  for authority for the proposition that the way a mark is to be used cannot be taken into account by the confusion analysis. In that case, however, the Registrar had reviewed not just the components of the words, but had considered the way the mark would look on boxes and menus and what colours were to be used in the backgrounds. In my view, this is quite different than analyzing the way the words in the trademark are to appear. Had the Registrar weighed evidence showing that the mark of the Applicant was to appear on the heel of a boot and that of the Respondent on the tongue, the situation would be analogous to that faced by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Mr. Submarine 
 ; that would likely have been an error. But the use of the components of the marks, in this case, is the same type of assessment as was discussed with approval in  
 Pink Panther 
 .
