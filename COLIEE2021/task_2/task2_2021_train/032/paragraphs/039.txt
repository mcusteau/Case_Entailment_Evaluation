  I note first that the Registrar did not misconstrue the evidence on this point. The evidence was that the Respondent had not used the mark in Canada for footwear. I also note that this evidence was coupled, in the view of the Registrar, with the fact that the TIMBERLAND mark was better known for footwear than it was for clothing. That is, the Applicant's lack of use of its mark for footwear was not the sole reason relied on by the Registrar.
