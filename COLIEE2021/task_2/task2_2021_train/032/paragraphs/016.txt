  In an opposition proceeding, the onus is on the applicant to establish that there is no likelihood of confusion between the applied-for mark and the mark of the opponent. In this case, the Applicant had to satisfy the Registrar, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no likelihood of confusion between its mark, TIMBER CREEK BY WRANGLER, and the Respondent's mark, TIMBERLAND. The Applicant submits that the Registrar erred by using a "still in doubt" standard, which standard was rejected by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Dion Neckwear Ltd. v. Christian Dior, S.A. et al. 
 , [2002] 3 F.C. 405; 286 N.R. 336 (F.C.A.).
