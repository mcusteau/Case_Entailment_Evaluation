 [3] 
  The parties raise the following issues: 
 
 
 
 1) What is the standard of review? 
 
 
 
 2) Did the Registrar err: 
 
 
 
 (a) by imposing the wrong standard of proof on the Applicant; 
 
 
 
 (b) by incorrectly dissecting or considering the use of the trademarks in his assessment under s. 6(5)(e) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, as amended (the " 
 Act 
 "); or 
 
 
 
 (c) by placing undue weight on the fact that the Applicant had not yet used its trademark in association with footwear?
