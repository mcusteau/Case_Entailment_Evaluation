  The first problem for the Applicant is the question of whether this is "new" evidence. When additional evidence is filed, the test is "one of quality, not quantity" ( 
 Canadian Council of Professional Engineers v. APA - The Engineered Wood Association 
  (2000), 184 F.T.R. 55; 7 C.P.R.(4th) 239 (T.D.) (" 
 CCPE 
 "), at paras. 36-37). Such evidence that merely supplements or confirms earlier findings is insufficient to displace a standard of reasonableness simpliciter ( 
 CCPE 
  at paras. 35, 39;  
 AstraZeneca AB v. Novopharm Ltd. et al. 
  (2003), 300 N.R. 266; 24 C.P.R.(4th) 326 (F.C.A.), at para. 12).
