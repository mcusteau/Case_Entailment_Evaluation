 [15] 
  In the application before me, the Applicant argues that certain elements of the decision are not reasonable. Stated in other terms, the Applicant submits that, in respect of three important elements of the Registrar's refusal to allow the registration of the TIMBER CREEK BY WRANGLER for footwear, there is no sustainable line of analysis. As I turn to consider the arguments of the Applicant on each of the issues raised, I will examine first whether the Registrar erred. If the Registrar erred in respect of any of these elements, I will then consider whether the errors are fatal to the decision as a whole.
