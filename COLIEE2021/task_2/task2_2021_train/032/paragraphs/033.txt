  The Applicant submits that this passage indicates that the Registrar dissected the Applicant's mark and considered how it was used by the Applicant. For purposes of registrability, the Applicant asserts that the Registrar can only look at the mark as it is to be registered and not on how it is to be used in the marketplace ( 
 Mr. Submarine Ltd. v. Amandista Investments Ltd. 
  (1987), 81 N.R. 257; 19 C.P.R.(3d) 3 (F.C.A.), at 11). In other words, the Applicant argues that, while this evidence might be relevant for a passing off action, the Registrar should not have given it any weight in assessing confusion.
