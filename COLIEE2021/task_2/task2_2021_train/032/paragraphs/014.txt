  What can make a line of analysis unreasonable? Without considering all possible ways in which a line of analysis could be unreasonable, it appears to me that a line of analysis based on a misapprehension of the evidence could suffice. Also, if the decision maker ignores relevant, material evidence or applies a wrong legal test to arrive at his finding, the line of analysis may not be sustainable. However, even if a court finds that one or more elements of a decision are unreasonable, it does not follow that the decision as a whole is unreasonable. It would then be necessary to examine the impact of those elements on the decision to assess whether, in spite of errors, the decision, as a whole, is "tenable".
