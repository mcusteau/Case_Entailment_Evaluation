  Both parties referred me to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Ryan v. Law Society of New Brunswick 
 , [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247; 302 N.R. 1; 257 N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207, as instructive on the question of the meaning of reasonableness simpliciter. Justice Iacobucci, writing in a unanimous decision of the Court in that case, considered what the reasonableness standard requires of a reviewing court. Helpfully, he pointed out a number of characteristics of this standard and how the Court should conduct its "somewhat probing analysis". For purposes of this application and the issues raised by the Applicant, I view the following statement of Justice Iacobucci to be the most instructive: 
 
 
 
 "A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived." (para. 55)
