  At p. 13 of his decision, the Registrar states that: 
 
 
 
 "As for s. 6(5)(e) of the  
 Act 
 , there is a fair degree of resemblance between the marks at issue in all respects. Both commence with the word TIMBER and both suggest a forest-related idea. Although the applicant's mark includes the additional words BY WRANGLER, the applicant's own evidence shows that the applicant often downplays this portion of the mark and instead emphasizes the first two elements, namely TIMBER CREEK."
