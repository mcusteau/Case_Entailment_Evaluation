  As taught by  
 Molson Breweries, A Partnership v. Labatt (John) Ltd. et al. 
  (2000), 252 N.R. 91; 5 C.P.R.(4th) 180 (F.C.A.), at p. 196, where the Registrar has committed an error of law or where significant additional evidence is adduced that would have materially affected the Registrar's findings of fact or the exercise of his discretion, the standard of review is correctness and the Court must come to its own conclusion as to the correctness of the Registrar's decision. Otherwise, the standard is one of reasonableness simpliciter. Accordingly, the first question is whether the impressive array of TIMBERLINE footwear, including sandals and running shoes, gathered by the Applicant from a number of sources, constitutes new evidence.
