  As an administrative body, the IAD is master of its own procedure and therefore, this Court should be reticent to intervene in its procedural choices ( 
 Aslani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Canada) 
 , [2006] FC 351, [2006] F.C.J. No. 422 (QL), at para. 21). In  
 Prassad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1989] 1 S.C.R. 560, at para. 16, Sopinka J. indicated: 
 
 
 
 We are dealing here with the powers of an administrative tribunal in relation to its procedures. As a general rule, these tribunals are considered to be masters in their own house. In the absence of specific rules laid down by statute or regulation, they control their own procedures subject to the proviso that they comply with the rules of fairness and, where they exercise judicial or quasi-judicial functions, the rules of natural justice.
