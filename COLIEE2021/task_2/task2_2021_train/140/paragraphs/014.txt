  Since the applicants were found to be credible, the Board should have shown that it had analyzed the relevant documents adduced in evidence in order to determine this question (see, for example, exhibit 2.1 of the National Documentation Package, June 23, 2006, document 2.1: Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2005, March 8, 2006). This is an excerpt from the introduction to this report: 
 
 
 
 Mexico, with a population [of] 106 million, is a federal republic composed of 31 states and a federal district, with an elected president and bicameral legislature. In 2000 voters elected President Vicente Fox Quesada of the National Action Party to a six-year term in generally free and fair multiparty elections. While civilian authorities generally maintained effective control of the security forces, elements of the security forces frequently acted independently of government authority. 
 
 
 
 The government generally respected and promoted human rights at the national level; however, violations persisted at the state and local level. The government investigated, prosecuted, and sentenced several public officials and members of security forces involved in criminal acts; however, impunity and corruption remained a problem. Local police released suspects who claimed to have been tortured as part of investigations, and authorities investigated complaints of torture, but authorities rarely punished officials for torture. There was a marked increase during the year in narcotics trafficking-related violence, especially in the northern border region. Violence against women continued to be a problem nationwide, particularly in Ciudad Juarez and the surrounding area. Government efforts to improve respect for human rights were offset by a deeply entrenched culture of impunity and corruption. The following human rights problems were reported: 
 
 
 
 • unlawful killings by security forces 
 
 • vigilante killings 
 
 • kidnappings, including by police 
 
 • torture, particularly to force confessions 
 
 • poor, overcrowded, sometimes life-threatening prison conditions 
 
 • arbitrary arrest and detention 
 
 • corruption, inefficiency, and lack of transparency in the judicial system 
 
 • statements coerced through torture permitted as evidence in trials 
 
 • criminal intimidation of journalists, leading to self-censorship 
 
 • corruption at all levels of government 
 
 • domestic violence against women often perpetrated with impunity 
 
 • criminal violence, including killings, against women 
 
 • trafficking in persons, allegedly with official involvement 
 
 • social and economic discrimination against indigenous people 
 
 • child labor
