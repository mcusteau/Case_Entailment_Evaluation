  In G.D.C.P. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 989, [2002] F.C.J. No. 1331 (QL), Madam Justice Elizabeth Heneghan confirmed that applicants are not required to show that they have exhausted all avenues of protection. Rather, applicants must demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable steps, considering the context of the country of origin in general, all the steps that they did in fact take and their interaction with the authorities (see also: D'Mello v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] F.C.J. No. 72 (QL), by Mr. Justice Frederick Gibson).
