When the evidence submitted by the taxpayer applicant raises reasonable doubt about the sufficiency of evidence originally provided by the Crown in an ex parte application, it is implicit in the process established by s. 225.2(8) that the court considering review of the authorization once made may consider evidence originally presented on behalf of the Minister in support of the jeopardy order and any additional evidence by affidavit or from cross-examination of affiants, presented by either party in relation to the motion for review. The evidence must be considered in relation to the test established by s. 225.2(2) itself and by relevant cases, that is, whether on a balance of probability the evidence leads to the conclusion that it is more likely than not that collection would be jeopardized by delay.
