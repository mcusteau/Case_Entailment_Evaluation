In commenting upon s. 225.1 Mr. Justice Joyal observed in Laframboise v. Canada, [1986] 2 C.T.C. 274; 5 F.T.R. 161, at 275 (C.T.C.),
"These rules represent a considerable departure from a long-standing provision in the Income Tax Act and are meant to dampen considerably the right of the Minister to collect a tax until various avenues of appeal have been exhausted."
