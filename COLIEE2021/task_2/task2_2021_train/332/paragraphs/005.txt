While contesting the validity of orders of this court the applicant corporation and its principal officer, David Brough, simultaneously pursued recourse open to them under the Income Tax Act. It appears that in June 1988 application was made to the Tax Court of Canada to permit filing of a Notice of Objection to the Minister's reassessment of the corporation's tax liability for 1984, 1985 and 1986 after the normal time for filing and thus to initiate the process of appeal of that assessment. It is claimed that notice of reassessment was not received prior to seizure of the aircraft now held by the sheriff. The matter was heard by the Tax court November 28, 1988, and thereafter it allowed the application for late filing. On that same day as the Tax Court heard the application the Crown applied ex parte to this court and was issued the so-called "jeopardy order" under s. 225.2(2) of the Income Tax Act as amended, the order which the applicant's motion of December 22, 1988 seeks to have reviewed and set aside.
