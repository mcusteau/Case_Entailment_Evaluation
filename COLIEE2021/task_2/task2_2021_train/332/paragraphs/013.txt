On behalf of the applicant, Satellite, counsel submits that cases decided in relation to s. 225.2 as it was prior to amendment in 1988 are relevant at least insofar as the former and the current s. 225.2 are similar. I accept that submission but where there are differences in the legislative provisions, the later ones naturally prevail and comments that deal with matters inconsistent with the current legislation are not useful.
