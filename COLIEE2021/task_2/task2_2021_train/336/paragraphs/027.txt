I repeat the references in the text of the agreement that refer to an agency relationship in regard to distribution of television product. B.V. is expressly described by paragraph C.3.(a) as the "collection agent" for the plaintiff in respect of the latter's share of television gross receipts as defined. That relationship is expressly from the general clause D.14 which negates creation of an agency relationship under the agreement, except for the provisions constituting B.V. a collection agent for either of the other parties in relation to gross revenues received in excess of its own shares.
