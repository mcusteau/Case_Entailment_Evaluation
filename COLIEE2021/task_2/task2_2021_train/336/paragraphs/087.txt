On the other hand, the use of theatrical product, feature films produced for theatrical exhibition and subsequently modified for exhibition by television, though perhaps technically modified in many respects, is still basically the theatrical product and is, in my opinion, "motion picture film" within the meaning of those words in Article XIIIC. Similarly, I conclude that videotape form of the modified feature film produced for theatrical exhibition is also "motion picture film" within the meaning of those words in Article XIIIC. The form in this instance is not significant, as Mr. Keeble's evidence made clear, it is the product that is significant and that product, though converted to videotape for presentation or exhibition on television, remains basically the theatrical product produced originally for theatrical exhibition, albeit modified technically and in some dramatic aspects for exhibition by television.
