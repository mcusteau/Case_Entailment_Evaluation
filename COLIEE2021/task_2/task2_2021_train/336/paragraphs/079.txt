These definitions clearly relate "motion picture" and "film" to the chemical process of photography and to the display, in the case of motion picture films, by means of a projector and screen. Television is, of course, an electronic medium, by which electronic messages are broadcast through the air directly or via satellite, or carried wholly or partly in transmission by cable. Television does not involve a projector and a screen of the sort used in display of motion picture films product, though it does involve the use of other equipment which permits the use of film or videotape to create electronic signals which for the viewer are reconverted, by means of the receiving set, to visual moving objects on the television "screen".
