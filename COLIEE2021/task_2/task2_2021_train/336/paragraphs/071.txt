The history of Canadian income tax legislation providing for tax on nonresidents in relation to payments made in Canada as royalties or fees for use of theatrical or television product was referred to by counsel for both parties. From 1935 payments "in respect of ... any rights in and to use of any copyrighted work subsequently produced or reproduced in Canada by way of ... mechanical sound on or from ... films or mechanical devices of any description" was subject to tax (S.C. 1935, c. 40, s. 9). In the following year that provision was extended to include payments in relation to rights in and to the use of any work whether copyrighted or not, but in the case of motion picture films 60 percent of such payments were not subject to tax (S.C. 1936, c. 38, s. 8).
