Yet that difference, and specific reasons for it, are not directly relevant to the issue of the plaintiff's liability for tax under s. 212(5) of the
Act
. That issue is to be resolved by construction of the
Act
as it applies to the situation of the plaintiff. The key factor in assessing the plaintiff's situation is whether B.V.'s operations in Canada, in the sublicensing of television product for use in Canada, and receipt of revenues for that, were carried on as an agent of the plaintiff or on B.V.'s own account. In my view that depends upon assessment of the relationship between the plaintiff and B.V., and between Canadian sublicensees of B.V. with B.V. and with the plaintiff, since under s. 212(5) tax is assessed on every amount that "a person resident in Canada pays or credits ... to him [a nonresident person] as, on account or in lieu of payment of, or in satisfaction of, payment for a right in or to the use of (a) a motion picture film, or (b) a film or videotape for use in connection with television that has been or is to be used or reproduced in Canada".
