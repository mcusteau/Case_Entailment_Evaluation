For the defendant it was argued that the legislative history demonstrates Parliament's intent to tax payments made for use of intellectual property rights, copyrights. I am not persuaded that this is so since tax was applied to noncopyrighted works, including films, as early as 1936, and the relevant statutory provisions since 1962 have made reference only to motion picture films, films, and videotapes without reference to copyright in those works. Moreover, even if Parliament were intent on taxing payments for the use of the underlying rights in such works, that is not helpful in determining what the words "motion picture films" mean in Article XIIIC.
