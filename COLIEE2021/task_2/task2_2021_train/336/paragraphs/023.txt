Much of the argument concerning this issue related to the relationship of B.V. to the plaintiff under the agreement of January 1, 1976, between Universal, Limited and B.V. Its preambles refer to earlier agreements, first between Universal and B.V. granting distribution rights to B.V., until 1983, for theatrical product throughout the world excluding the United States and Canada, and second, between Limited and B.V. granting B.V. distribution rights for television product outside the United States and Puerto Rico except for two television stations, one in Mexico and another in Windsor, Canada. The preambles also refer to the desire of the parties to reaffirm and restate the existing rights and relationships and to make certain modifications to them.
