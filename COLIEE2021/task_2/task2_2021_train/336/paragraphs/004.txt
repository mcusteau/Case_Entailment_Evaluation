In reassessing the plaintiff, and in applying the
Act
and the tax convention, the Minister relied upon certain assumptions of fact, two of which are here challenged by the plaintiff. These challenged assumptions are as follows.
1) MCA International, B.V., a Netherlands company, was a licensee of the plaintiff that licensed "television product" to television stations and networks in Canada but the plaintiff's share of the royalty payments received by MCA International, B.V., from the television stations and networks were received as collection agent of the plaintiff and not on MCA International's own account.
2) Television films and videotapes of motion picture films were motion picture films for the purposes of Article XIIIC of the Canada-U.S. Income Tax Convention, 1942.
