From its one account in Amsterdam, B.V. funds its own operations. In the years in question those operations, in addition to activities arising in promotion and distribution of TV product and theatrical product, included the provision of television signal by early long distance transmission to oil companies operating in the Near East and to some military bases, its investments in properties in various countries to support B.V.'s operations, investments in a major German theatre chain, and investments in production of theatrical or television product in various countries. B.V. also manages the fund deposited in its account for short term investment purposes. It accounts to the plaintiff and to Universal on a regular basis and transfers funds to them in accord with the 1976 agreement, based on its accounting for receipts.
