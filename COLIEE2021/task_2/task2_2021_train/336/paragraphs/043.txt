Payments of license fees by Canadian television exhibitors are made to the Canadian division concerned and all receipts are deposited in its deposit account. From that account transfers are made, on authorization from B.V.'s head office in Amsterdam, to an operating account in Canada for the division's expenses in its Canadian operations, and the balance is transferred, from the Canadian deposit accounts, of both MCA TV (Canada) and Universal Films (Canada), to a single B.V. account in Amsterdam, which is maintained for deposit of all receipts from the various countries in which B.V. operates, and receipts from C.I.C. for its operations in sublicensing theatrical product throughout the world except in the U.S. and Canada.
