The Minister's implied assumption appears to be that if B.V. receives a portion of royalty payments as a collection agent for the plaintiff, liability for tax arises under s. 212(5). The plaintiff disputes the latter conclusion, arguing that even if, under its agreement with the plaintiff, B.V. as a receiver of license fees is a collection agent for Limited's share of gross television receipts, it is not liable for tax under s. 212(5). In essence, the argument is that since the sublicensing agreements between B.V. and Canadian exhibitors created no relationship of debtor and creditor as between those exhibitors and the plaintiff, the payments were made to B.V. on B.V.'s own account. Whatever the description of "collection agent" as used in the agreement might mean it did not make B.V. the plaintiff's agent in dealings with Canadian exhibitors. Thus payments to B.V. did not constitute payment to the plaintiff.
