If Canadian exhibitors did not pay or credit to the plaintiff any amount for a right to use of the television product, the plaintiff cannot, in my opinion, be liable for income tax under s. 212(5). Moreover, any liability B.V. may have had for payment to the plaintiff of funds received, or any portion of them, did not result in payment by Canadian exhibitors being made, in regard to any payments or portion of any payment, to the plaintiff.
