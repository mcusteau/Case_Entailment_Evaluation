The plaintiff claims that it is not subject to tax under s. 212(5). It does not carry on business in Canada. The "television product" for which it holds a licence for world-wide distribution, is licensed by the plaintiff, for distribution in Canada, to a Dutch corporation, referred to in the Minister's assumptions as "MCA International, B.V." and in these Reasons as "B.V.". The plaintiff maintains that payments of royalties by Canadian licensees for exhibition of the television product were made to the Dutch company on B.V.'s own account, and were not subject to tax under the
Canada-Netherlands Income Tax Agreement (1957)
. As earlier noted, the Minister's assumption is that a share of royalty payments by Canadian licensees was received by the Dutch company as collection agent of the plaintiff and not on B.V.'s own account.
