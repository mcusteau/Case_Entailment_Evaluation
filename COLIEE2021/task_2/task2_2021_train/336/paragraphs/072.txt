Commencing in 1949, a particular subsection of the
Act
, a forerunner to the current s. 212(5) was enacted to provide for tax liability of a nonresident of ten percent on every amount that a Canadian resident "pays or credits to him as ... payment for a right in or to the use of motion picture films that have been or are to be produced in Canada" (S.C. 1949 (2nd Sess.), c. 25, s. 38). In 1954 this provision was amended to provide, for the first time, specific reference to television use of films, by referring to payments made "for a right in or to the use of motion picture films (including films for use in connection with television) that have been or are to be used or reproduced in Canada" (S.C. 1953-54, c. 57, s. 27). In 1962 a provision similar in wording to the later s. 212(5), but with a tax rate of only 10% was enacted (S.C. 1962-63, c. 8, s. 22). The tax rate was increased to 25% in 1971 (S.C. 1970-71-72, c. 63, s. 212(5)) and by later amendment the specific wording of s. 212(5), as it applied to the years here in question was adopted (S.C. 1973-74, c. 14, s. 68). Thus, since 1962, the
Act
has provided liability for tax on payments for a right in or to the use of two different products "motion picture films or films or videotapes for use in connection with television".
