While it is now clear to the plaintiff that the description of the relationship of B.V. to the plaintiff, as a collection agent, ought not to have included receipts from Canadian exhibitors under agreements with B.V., the words included in agreements made for sophisticated business operations by knowledgeable persons acting freely in their own interests must be deemed to express the intention of the parties. In this case striking out the provision in paragraph C.3.(a) that refers to B.V.'s role as a collection agent for Limited in relation to funds received in excess of B.V.'s own share of gross television receipts would not serve the interests of the parties to the agreement. Here, for example, there was no suggestion that it was really intended that paragraph C.3.(a) should not apply to receipts by B.V. from distribution of television product in all countries other than Canada, for the arrangement set out in the 1976 agreement simply reaffirmed the terms of the 1971 agreement between B.V. and the plaintiff's predecessor concerning distribution of television products in those other countries.
