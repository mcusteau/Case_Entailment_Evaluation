That conclusion, that B.V. was not an agent of the plaintiff in any general sense, is supported by the evidence of its operations in Canada. Those operations are carried on, as earlier noted, through two separate divisions, concerned respectively with promotion and distribution of theatrical product, in the case of Universal Films Canada, and promotion and distribution of television product in the case of MCA TV (Canada). Both operate in essentially similar fashion. In the case of the latter, its documents and bank accounts represent it as MCA TV (Canada), a Division of MCA International B.V. It operates independently, negotiating with Canadian television networks and stations for exhibition of television product, at prices or fees determined by negotiation. Copies of field order forms completed in Canada, listing the items of television product to be exhibited, the number of times of exhibition and the term for which the sublicense is to be valid, the prices negotiated, and any other terms particular to the sublicense agreement, are transmitted to B.V. in Amsterdam, and also to various offices of the plaintiff in the United States. The latter copies, sent to the plaintiff, are intended to ensure that legal obligations owed by the plaintiff to other parties are not compromised and that accounting for performing rights can be maintained, and also that the product will be available when scheduled for exhibition in Canada. It appears that the only other direct communications between the plaintiff Limited and MCA TV (Canada) are that the former supplies the Canadian division with information on anticipated scheduling of major television productions in the United States, a matter of interest to Canadian exhibitors for their own scheduling, and the plaintiff ships product to B.V. in Canada, as it does to other countries.
