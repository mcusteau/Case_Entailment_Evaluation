More helpful is the evidence of terminology as used in the industry. From the plaintiff's annual reports it appears "motion picture film" or "feature film" are terms used only in relation to product originally intended for theatrical distribution, while product made for direct release on television was referred to as "made for television film" or "television film". In the 1976 agreement between B.V. and the plaintiff and Universal, the distinction is maintained in relation to television product, defined as "the various feature motion pictures initially released for theatrical exhibition which have become available for television distribution and television films initially released for free television distribution ...". Theatrical product is defined in that agreement as "All various feature motion picture, short subjects and trailers, initially released for theatrical exhibition, or which subsequently become available for foreign theatrical release which are produced, supplied and/or distributed by" (Universal). In its sublicensing agreements with Canadian television exhibitors B.V. consistently used the words "motion picture films" with reference only to products originally produced for theatrical distribution, and other products on film were referred to generally as films for television. There is, in addition, the evidence of Mr. Slusser and Mr. Keeble that in the industry the words "motion picture films" would be used with reference only to product originally produced for theatrical distribution.
