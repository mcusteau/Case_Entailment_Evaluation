That evolving legislative treatment for tax purposes of payments to nonresidents for use of theatrical product or television product in Canada has only been reflected periodically in Canada-United States tax conventions. The Convention of 1942 made no specific reference to taxes on such payments until it was later amended by protocol in 1950 in which Article XIIIC, in issue in this case, was included and was subsequently enacted by Parliament. That Convention clause remained in effect until replaced by Article XII, dealing with tax on royalties, in the Canada-United States Income Tax Convention (1980), enacted and declared in force August, 1984. The terms of the last agreement, currently in force, are more precise and specifically include reference to television in an exclusion clause from a general exemption from tax on copyright and similar royalties, in the phrase "royalties in respect of motion pictures and works on film, videotape or other means of reproduction for use in connection with television". Obviously, the evolution of international tax treaty law lags behind developing technology and behind Parliament's legislative changes designed to have domestic tax law relate to social and commercial activity arising from developing technology.
