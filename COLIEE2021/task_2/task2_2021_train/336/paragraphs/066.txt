Finally, in a technical sense theatrical and television product is significantly different and this generally results in changes in any theatrical product before it is exhibited on television. Theatrical product is produced on film, primarily 35 mm., at least initially. The film process is a chemical process with approximately 2000 lines of resolution permitting fine colour composition and with a wide rectangular shaped picture resulting. Videotape is an electronic process with some 525 lines of resolution in North America with less fine colour composition than film product, and television product produces a picture that is more square in screen dimensions than product for theatrical distribution. The different dimensions mean that product made for theatrical exhibition requires substantial technical modification for television exhibition, reducing the broad scene provided on film, and because of the different processes and frames per second involved, special conversion equipment is required, a telecine machine, for film to be exhibited for television. Most film for television is 16 mm., particularly in Canada where expensive equipment for handling 35 mm. film is not generally available. Mr. Keeble described the technical differences between film and television exhibition in this way.
"Film technology requires 24 picture ('frames') per second for both recording and projection, whereas television requires 30 frames per second. Film can be used in a theatre or elsewhere by projecting it on a screen. It cannot be used for television unless the images are first run through special telecine equipment which converts 24 frames to the television standard of 30, and also converts the optical images previously recorded on film into electronic television signals suitable for broadcasting."
