The plaintiff Limited urges that if it is otherwise liable for tax under s. 212(5), it is exempt from tax because of Article XIIIC of the Tax Convention between Canada and the United States as modified in 1950. As we have seen that provision read:
"Royalties for the right to use copyrights or in respect of the right to produce or reproduce any literary, dramatic, musical, or artistic work (but not inclusive of rents or royalties in respect of motion picture films) derived from sources within one of the contracting States by a resident or corporation or other entity of the other contracting State not engaged in trade or business in the former State through a permanent establishment shall be exempt from tax imposed by such former State."
The plaintiff contends that the royalties or license fees paid for use of television product were not "rents or royalties in respect of motion picture films" as that phrase is used in the exclusion from the general exemption from tax under Article XIIIC. The Minister's assumption on which reassessments were based, which is disputed by the plaintiff's claim, was that television films and videotapes of motion picture films were motion picture films for purposes of Article XIIIC of the Canada-U.S. Income Tax Convention, 1942.
