 [7] 
  By letter dated February 7, 2003 an Assistant Director of the Verification and Enforcement Division of the CCRA advised Mr. Simmonds that his request was rejected for two reasons. First, it was determined not to be appropriate to accept the late-filed election because Mr. Simmonds had not exercised a reasonable amount of care in respect of his 1993 tax return. Second, with respect to subsection 50(1) of the  
 Act 
 , it was concluded "that it would not have been reasonable (as at December 31, 1993) to expect that [PGL] would be 'dissolved or wound up'. Mr. Simmonds' shares of PGL did not meet this requirement in 1993".
