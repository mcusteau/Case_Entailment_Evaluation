  In the present case, the issue to be determined is not a pure question of law and I am not satisfied that the evidence is so conclusive that there is only one possible result. Equally important, a fairness request requires an exercise of ministerial discretion that should not, absent some exceptional reason, be directed by the Court. I therefore order that the matter be remitted for redetermination by a different decision-maker in accordance with these reasons.
