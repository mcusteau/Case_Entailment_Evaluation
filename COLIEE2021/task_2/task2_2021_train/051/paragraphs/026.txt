  The Director's decision, as stated at page 6 of the decision, turned on his view that "it was not reasonable to expect that PGL would be dissolved or wound up as of December 31, 1993". This view was premised, in largest part, upon the facts that: 
 
 
 
 1. No formal process had been taken to formally dissolve or wind up PGL; 
 
 
 
 2. PGL continued to serve its primary purpose of holding its investment in PDGL and, related to this, as shareholder in PDGL and named plaintiff in the lawsuit it was not reasonable to expect PGL to be dissolved or wound up until the lawsuit was settled or there was a change in the corporate structure; 
 
 
 
 3. The transfer of the consulting business out of PGL was of little moment, because it would "have been more reasonable" to have kept the consulting activity within PGL; and 
 
 
 
 4. PGL registered for the GST on April 1, 1994, filed GST credit returns, and continued to operate a bank account.
