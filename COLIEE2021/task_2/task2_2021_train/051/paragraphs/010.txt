  By a lengthy letter dated April 13, 2004 the Director advised Mr. Simmonds that he was unable to accede to Mr. Simmonds' request for an ABIL. The rationale for this decision was expressed to be as follows: 
 
 
 
 "I have denied your request as your PGL shares have failed to meet the legislative requirements of subsection 50(1) of the  
 Income Tax Act 
  ( 
 ITA 
 ) as it read on December 31, 1993. In particular, it is my opinion that it was not reasonable to expect that PGL will be dissolved or wound up and will not begin to carry on business as of December 31, 1993 as required by clause 50(1)(b)(iii)(A)."
