  In this case, the RPD's integrated assessment focused on two issues, both which were relevant to the claims made by the Applicants under each of sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA. These issues were (i) whether the failure of the Applicants to seek asylum or to otherwise legalize their status in the United States for over eight years was consistent with their stated fears, and (ii) whether the documentary evidence provided any objective basis for those fears. In this context, it was not necessary for the RPD to conduct a separate analysis of the Applicants' claims under sections 96 and 97 of the IRPA, as the Applicants' claims and the evidence adduced could comfortably be assessed in an integrated fashion.
