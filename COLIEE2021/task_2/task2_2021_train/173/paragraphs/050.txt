  The RPD's decision makes it clear that the Applicants' claims and the evidence adduced were assessed in terms of the distinct requirements of each of sections 96 and 97. As in  
 Nagaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 204, at paras. 42-43, the RPD's conclusions plainly apply to both sections of the IRPA. This was very different from the type of situation that arose in  
 Kilic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2004 FC 84, where the RPD failed to explain the basis for its determination with respect to section 97 and to discuss in its integrated assessment claims that were relevant under that section.
