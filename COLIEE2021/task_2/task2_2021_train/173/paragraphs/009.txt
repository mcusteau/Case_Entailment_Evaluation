  Mr. Gutierrez Rodriguez (Gutierrez) claims to have been approached by representatives of the FARC in October 1999, while he worked as a bus driver for a transportation co-operative. Specifically, he claims that he received a telephone call on his cell phone from a member of the FARC, who told him that he was now at their service. The caller identified members of his family and their workplaces and demanded that he provide them with information about the children who rode his bus.
