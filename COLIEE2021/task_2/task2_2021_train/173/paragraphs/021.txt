  With respect to whether the RPD erred in failing to conduct a separate analysis under section 97, the standard of review that has been applied by this Court has depended upon how the Court has characterized the nature of the question. Where the question has been characterized as being a question of law or adequacy of reasons, the Court has stated that a standard of correctness applies. (See, for example,  
 Mahmutyazicioglu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 668, at para. 11;  
 Guzman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 1329, at para. 25;  
 Plancher v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 1283, at para. 12;  
 Balakumar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 20, at para. 9;  
 Nyoka v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 568, at para. 13;  
 Nagaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 204, at para. 17;  
 Emamgongo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 208, at para. 14;  
 Jabari v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 225, at para. 12;  
 Prieto v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 253, at para. 24.) However, where the question has been characterized as one of mixed fact and law, the Court has stated that a standard of reasonableness applies. (See, for example,  
 Ayaichia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 239, at para. 12;  
 Nyathi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FC 1119, at para. 10;  
 Amare v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 228, at para. 10).
