  I am unable to conclude that the RPD's decision was unreasonable for any of the reasons put forth by the Applicants in relation to the RPD's assessment of the evidence. In my view, the RPD's conclusion regarding the lack of objective foundation for the Applicants' claims was well within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. The RPD's assessment was also appropriately justified, transparent and intelligible.
