  Madam Justice Dawson distinguished  
 Febles 
 , above. She said at paragraph 71: 
 
 
 
 In reaching this conclusion, I am mindful that this Court has previously applied the correctness standard of review to the Refugee Protection Division's interpretation of international conventions (see, for example,  
 Febles v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2012 FCA 324, [2012] F.C.J. No. 1609, at paragraphs 22 to 25). There, the presumption of reasonableness review was rebutted by the majority of the Court in view of the need to interpret international conventions uniformly. In my view, cases such as  
 Febles 
  are distinguishable on the basis that here, the Board was interpreting sections 37 and 117 of the Act. Further, unlike the Refugee Convention, the Protocol anticipates individual states will enact different measures to fulfil the Protocol's objectives (see: article 6, section 4). The uniformity concerns in  
 Febles 
  do not apply to the Protocol.
