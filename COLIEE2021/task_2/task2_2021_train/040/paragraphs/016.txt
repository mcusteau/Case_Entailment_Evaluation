  In  
 B377 
 , Mr. Justice Blanchard also held that the applicable standard of review was reasonableness. It is implicit in his reasons that a finding that B377 was a member of a "particular social group" would be unreasonable. However, his interpretation of the set of reasons was that the RPD conducted a detailed mixed motives analysis, and that the fear of persecution was based, at least in part, on Tamil ethnicity or race. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence to support a motive based on a United Nations Convention ground ( 
 Gonsalves v Canada (Attorney General) 
 , 2011 FC 648 and  
 Veeravagu v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1992] FCJ No 468 (QL) (CA). He added that the RPD's conclusion with respect to political opinion was problematic. Imputed knowledge, in this case knowledge of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam [LTTE] because they had organized the voyage of the Sun Sea, did not necessarily lead to a finding of imputed political opinion.
