  Mr. Ward was not found to be a member of a particular social group. At page 754, Mr. Justice La Forest added: 
 
 
 
 The group of INLA members is not a "particular social group". To review, the test given above includes: 
 
 
 
 (1) groups defined by an innate or unchangeable characteristic; 
 
 
 
 (2) groups whose members voluntarily associate for reasons so fundamental to their human dignity that they should not be forced to forsake the association; and 
 
 
 
 (3) groups associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence.
