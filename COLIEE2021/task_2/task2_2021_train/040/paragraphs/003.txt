  In  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v B472 
 , 2013 FC 151, [2013] FCJ No 192 (QL), I was of the opinion that refugee status was granted on the basis of the applicant facing persecution as a member of a "particular social group" within the meaning of s. 96 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  [IRPA]. I held that the standard of review was correctness, and that the decision was incorrect. I certified the standard of review as a serious question of general importance which would support an appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. No appeal was taken.
