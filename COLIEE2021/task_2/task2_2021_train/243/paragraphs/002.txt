The material filed in support of the application consists primarily of the affidavit of the applicant and of Samina Husain, student-at-law. The material on behalf of the respondent consists of the affidavit of Brian Edward Doherty, immigration officer. It is not in dispute that the applicant arrived in Canada in August of 1974 with a visitor's visa which, after two extensions, allowed him to remain legally in Canada until March 1, 1975. He evidently remained in Canada illegally from that time until June 21, 1980, when he was arrested by an immigration officer for being illegally in Canada and engaging in unauthorized employment. Following an inquiry pursuant to section 27 of the Immigration Act, Mr. Rai was ordered deported and on July 11, 1980, was taken to Calgary International Airport by immigration officer B.J. Townsend and an escort officer. At this point, there is a factual dispute.
