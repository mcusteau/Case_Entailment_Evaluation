Notwithstanding this distinction, the Applicant's argument fails for two reasons. First, while it is difficult for the Court to rationalize how different factors could be given the same number of points, given the replacement and reassignment of one job function for one ostensibly dissimilar, it is not for the Court to reweigh evidence before the Committee. In other words, there is no evidence before the Court to establish that mathematical model development should be awarded greater credit than the calculation of rates by spreadsheet application; nor is there evidence to show that the credit awarded was unreasonable. Second, there is no evidence before the Court to establish that the Applicant's own position work description was a comparator assessed by the Committee. It is clear that the Applicant submitted to the Committee that his position should have been classified in the ES group; it is not clear that the Applicant submitted in the alternative that his level in the SI group should be compared to the SI-03 classification dated December 13, 2000. Before the Committee, the griever bears the onus of establishing that the classification was wrong. The Committee's recommendation is not patently unreasonable for having failed to evaluate a comparator group which it did not raise, and which was not raised as a material issue by the Applicant.
