FAA
grants the Treasury Board authority to determine its own rules and procedures, pursuant to which it established the
Treasury Board Manual
, to ensure that "the relative value of all jobs in the public service is established in an equitable, consistent and effective manner and provides a basis for the compensation of public servants".
