  The Officer - reasonably, in my view - had concluded that the marriage was not genuine. Much of the evidence and observations related to the genuineness of the Applicant's marriage is also relevant to whether the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring permanent residence in Canada. The lack of genuineness presents strong evidence that the marriage was entered into for the purpose of gaining status. Moreover, the Officer had before her the evidence that the Applicant was married only after he was reported to immigration officials and that he has a seven-year history of not complying with immigration regulations. These were relevant considerations that were weighed by the Officer.
