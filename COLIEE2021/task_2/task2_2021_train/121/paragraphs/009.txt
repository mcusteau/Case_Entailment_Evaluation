  I note that the Officer makes an error in the cover letter dated May 4, 2009 by referring to Ms. Nawabi as the "common-law partner" of the Applicant. It is not disputed that the Applicant and Ms. Nawabi entered into a legal marriage and were not in a common-law relationship. It is obvious from the Decision and Reasons (contained in the Officer's Notes to File, which constitute the reasons in this matter) that the Officer's error in the cover letter was inadvertent and inconsequential. It does not constitute grounds to overturn the decision.
