 Snider, J. 
 : The Applicant, Mr. Sunil Dutt Sharma, is a citizen of India who came to Canada in 2000 on a work permit. His permit expired on December 31, 2001. A request for an extension was refused. In spite of this refusal, the Applicant remained in Canada illegally. During this time, it appears that the Applicant made no efforts to regularize his status in Canada. Seven years later, on November 22, 2008, the Applicant was reported for overstaying his visa. On November 25, 2008, the Applicant was reported for working in Canada without a work permit. As a result, an exclusion order was issued against the Applicant on December 3, 2008.
