  Pursuant to provisions in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) (in particular s. 12(1)) and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, S.O.R./2002-227 (the Regulations) and various policy documents of Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), a spouse of a Canadian citizen may become eligible for permanent resident status in Canada as a member of the "spouse or common-law partner in Canada class". However, under s. 4 of the Regulations, a foreign national shall not be considered to be a spouse if the marriage "is not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under [IRPA] ".
