  Meanwhile, the Applicant and Ms. Maliha Nawabi, who met in 2006, were engaged on October 19, 2008 and were married on November 25, 2008. On November 28, 2008, the Applicant applied for permanent resident status as a member of the Spouse or Common-law Partner in Canada class. In a decision dated May 4, 2009, an Immigration Officer refused the application on the basis that, on the balance of probabilities, the marriage was not genuine and was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring permanent residence in Canada.
