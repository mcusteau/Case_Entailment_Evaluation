The principles mentioned above clearly apply, although here there is no alleged misunderstanding or failure on the part of plaintiff's counsel. In the present case, we are not speaking of some short delay of 30 or even 90 days, but of a limitation period of two years (previously four years). This very long delay is clearly sufficient to permit the taxpayer to indicate on the prescribed form (N-15), the error and the nature of the goods.
