Counsel for the plaintiff argued that a taxing statute must always be construed strictly against the taxing authority and that a very clear statutory direction is required to absolve the government from paying a refund that would be due but for the existence of a limitation period. However, it would appear that since the Supreme Court of Canada decision in
Stubart Investments Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue
, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 536; 53 N.R. 241, taxing statutes are to be read in their entire context having regard to the legislative purpose and scheme. See Ruth Sullivan,
Driedger on the Construction of Statutes
(1994), (Toronto, Butterworths), at 406. Although the presumption in favour of the taxpayer survives, it must be examined in light of the purpose of the taxing provision. See
Driedger
at 408.
