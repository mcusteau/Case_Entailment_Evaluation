The plaintiff sold concrete that was mixed at the job site. It did not deduct the cost of transporting the concrete to the job site from the selling price for purposes of calculating sales tax. On May 26, 1988, in a letter to Revenue Canada, the plaintiff protested that sales tax on pre-mix concrete was calculated after deducting the cost of transporting concrete to the job site. It claimed the difference in treatment between pre-mix concrete and concrete mixed at the job site gave the plaintiff's pre-mix competitors an unfair advantage with respect to production costs. The plaintiff's protest was rejected by Revenue Canada in a letter dated June 6, 1988. The plaintiff continued to pay federal sales tax on the total sale price of concrete including that portion attributable to transportation costs.
