I confess to having some doubt as to the effect of the addition of the words "or otherwise" to s. 68. As far as I am aware, in the legal context, the subject matter of mistake is either law or fact. In my view, when Parliament used the words "whether by reason of mistake of fact or law" in s. 68, it must have had regard to the general law of mistake as understood by lawyers. The words "or otherwise" seem to have been added to ensure that the limitation period in s. 68 applied even if monies were paid for reason other than mistake of fact or law However, it appears that the words "or otherwise" modify the word "mistake", or at least the word "error". In either case, I have difficulty conceiving of what type of error or mistake Parliament had in mind with the addition of these words. If it was Parliament's intention that s. 68 apply regardless of the reason for the payment, I do not think that objective was accomplished by the addition of the words "or otherwise" to modify the words "mistake" or "error". In my view, the addition of these words make even more ambiguous the difficult subject of mistake as it is applied in s. 68. Some reconsideration of this provision by Parliament seems warranted. In any event, I do not think the addition of the words "or otherwise" distinguishes this case from
Premier Mouton.
