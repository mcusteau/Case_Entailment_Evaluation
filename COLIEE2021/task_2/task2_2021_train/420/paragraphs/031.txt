Counsel for the plaintiff also relied on
Monarch Concrete Products Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue (Customs and Excise)
, [1990] 1 C.T.C. 1; 29 F.T.R. 218 (T.D.), for the proposition that informal applications for refunds have an ongoing effect. If the plaintiff's letter of protest of May 26, 1988 could be characterized as the application for refund envisaged by s. 68, the question is whether it has a continuous effect so that it could be treated as protecting the plaintiff's entitlement to refund for the period extending back two years to May 26, 1986.
