I do not think an informal application for refund alone can have a continuing effect. Parliament has established a process under the
Excise Tax Act
for taxpayers to claim refunds. That process commences with an application for refund utilizing a prescribed form, pursuant to s. 72(2). Presumably, such a form is to fulfil Revenue Canada's need to have specified information in order to verify the validity and amount of the refund claimed. There is then a notice of determination by the Minister under s. 72(6). The taxpayer may then file a notice of objection under s. 81.17. Following this, the Minister issues a notice of decision under s. 81.17(5). Under ss. 81.19 and 81.2, the taxpayer may elect to appeal a negative notice of decision to the CITT or to this court. Pick-a-Mix Concrete Limited followed this course of action in bringing its appeal before the CITT, from the notice of objection stage forward.
