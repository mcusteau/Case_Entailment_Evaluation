In an article which I found useful entitled
The Recovery of Unconstitutional Taxes in Australia and in the United States
(1964), 42 Texas Law Rev. 763, to which La Forest, J., made reference in
Air Canada and Pacific Western Airlines Ltd. v. British Columbia
, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1161; 95 N.R. 1, at p. 1210 S.C.R., Clifford L. Pannam concurs with this approach at p. 786:
"Thus the mere fact that a protest has been made at the time of payment is a neutral factor. The loudest protest will not make a payment involuntary if there is in fact a choice as to whether the payment will be made. On the other hand, if there is in fact no choice, the existence of a protest is irrelevant. In borderline cases, however, a protest may afford some evidence of compulsion." (footnotes omitted)
