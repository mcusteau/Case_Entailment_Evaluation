A case with facts similar to the ones at bar is
474245 Ontario Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue
(1993), 1 G.T.C. 4086 (C.I.T.T.). In that case, the appellant claimed a refund for a period prior to two years before the filing of the refund application. The CITT denied the appeal, stating at p. 4088:
"The limitation period set out in section 68 of the
Act
is two years after the payment of the moneys. Since the Tribunal has no equitable jurisdiction to ignore or vary a limitation period such as the one prescribed under section 68 of the
Act
on the basis that it would be fair or just, the timeframe to be considered in determining the appellant's entitlement to a refund must be two years prior to the filing of the refund application in the prescribed form, or March 6, 1989, to March 6, 1991. The appellant, therefore, is not entitled to a refund for moneys paid prior to March 6, 1989, and this appeal is dismissed."
The plaintiff asserts that
474245 Ontario Limited
was wrongly decided because the CITT did not have regard to the relevant jurisprudence.
