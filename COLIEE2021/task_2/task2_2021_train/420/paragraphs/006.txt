Section 68 of the
Excise Tax Act
provides:
"68. Where a person, otherwise than pursuant to an assessment, has paid any moneys in error, whether by reason of mistake of fact or law or otherwise, and the moneys have been taken into account as taxes, penalties, interest or other sums under this Act, an amount equal to the amount of those moneys shall, subject to this Part, be paid to that person if he applies therefor within two years after the payment of the moneys."
On its face, s. 68 sets forth a two-year limitation period on refund claims for excise tax paid in error. (In this case the two-year period prior to the application filed by the plaintiff commenced on March 22, 1989. Counsel for the Minister advised that on a gratuitous basis the Minister allowed the refund for the period commencing September 25, 1988, which was two years before the
Pick-a-Mix
decision by the CITT.)
