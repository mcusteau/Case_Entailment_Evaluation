Pannam concludes at pp. 788 and 789:
"If taxes are promptly paid on the assumption that the statute authorizing them is valid, they cannot be recovered if in fact it turns out to be invalid. A mistake of law has been made and money paid under such a mistake cannot be recovered. Even if some doubt is felt about the validity of the authorizing statute, payments still cannot be recovered unless made in circumstances amounting to judicially cognizable duress, involuntariness or compulsion."
