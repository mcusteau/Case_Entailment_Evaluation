The importance of determining whether a payment of taxes has been made voluntarily is explained by Pannam at p. 784:
"Apart from the exceptions that have been established, an important limitation on the operation of the mistake of law rule is to be found in its very formulation. The rule only applies where there has been a
voluntary
payment so that, if it appears a payment has been made involuntarily, or under compulsion, then it can be recovered in an action for money had and received. The distinction between a voluntary and an involuntary payment thus becomes critical. It determines in any particular case whether or not there will be recovery. This explains why almost every reported case in the United States and in Australia dealing with the recovery of taxes paid under an unconstitutional statute is entirely devoted to an examination of whether the payment in question was made under compulsion or not. The same is true of the approach of the Canadian courts to this problem. The character of the payment is treated as determining its recoverability." (footnote omitted)
