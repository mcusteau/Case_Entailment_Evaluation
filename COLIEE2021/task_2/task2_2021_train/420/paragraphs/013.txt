Having regard to
Premier Mouton
, the issue is whether the plaintiff paid under a mistake of law, in view of its letter of protest and its obligation to pay federal sales tax under the
Excise Tax Act
. I have concluded that the plaintiff's letter of protest has limited legal significance and that the plaintiff did not pay sales tax under compulsion or duress. As a result, the plaintiff paid under a mistake of law and the two-year limitation period in s. 68 is applicable.
