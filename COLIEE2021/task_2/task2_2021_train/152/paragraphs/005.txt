  There is a long line of cases supporting the Minister's argument that reasons must not only be given, but must also be adequate and address the arguments and the most salient part of the evidence submitted by the parties. My colleague Mr. Justice Luc Martineau aptly summed up the relevant cases in  
 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Shpigelman 
 , [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 721; 2003 FC 1209: 
 
 
 
 "5. To fulfill the obligation described in paragraph 69.1(11)(b) of the  
 Act 
 , the reasons must be sufficiently clear, precise and intelligible to allow the Minister or the person making the claim to understand the grounds on which the decision is based and to allow the Court to ensure that the Refugee Division exercised its jurisdiction in accordance with the  
 Act 
 . See inter alia:  
 Mehterian v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1992] F.C.J. No. 545 (F.C.A.);  
 Minister of Citizenship and Immigration v. Roitman 
 , [2001] F.C.J. No. 718 (F.C.T.D.);  
 Zannat v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
  (2000), 188 F.T.R. 148;  
 Zoga v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , [1999] F.C.J. No. 1253 (F.C.T.D.);  
 Khan v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , [1998] F.C.J. No. 1187 (F.C.T.D.). 
 
 
 
 "6. A determination that there is a reasonable fear of persecution based on one of the grounds listed in the Convention raises a question of mixed fact and law. In  
 Chan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1995] 187 N.R. 321, the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized that a refugee claimant has the burden of proof in establishing a well-founded fear of persecution. Clearly, this determination calls for a careful analysis of the claimant's testimony and of the documentary evidence about the conditions in the country. When written reasons are required, it is not sufficient to state that the determination in the affirmative is based on the evidence without further explanation."
