  Because of the Officer's admitted reliance on the CBSA report, and the Officer's suspicions of the Applicant's employment income, my answer to the second question is also yes. As admitted by the Officer, the fairness letter made no reference to the CBSA report or these allegations. The CBSA report (or at least the substance of its contents, if secrecy was an issue) ought to have been disclosed in the fairness letter. Without this disclosure, the Applicant had no way of meaningfully responding to concerns that his source of income was illegitimate.
