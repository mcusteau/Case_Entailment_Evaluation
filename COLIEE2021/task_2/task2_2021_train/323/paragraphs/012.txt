It is noteworthy that the Board makes no reference in its decision that it considered Dr. del Junco's findings that the applicant's injuries are consistent with the applicant's account of how he received his injuries. The Board's decision also makes no reference to Dr. Hung-Tat Lo's psychiatric assessment confirming that the applicant suffers from an adjustment disorder with features of a post traumatic stress disorder, which are the direct consequence of persecution in his home country.
