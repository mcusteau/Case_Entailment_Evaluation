The applicant was stopped at random by the police because of his mannerisms and associations, which were revealing of his sexual orientation. The Board failed to explain why it believed that the applicant could live openly and support himself with no more than a mere possibility of persecution in Buenos Aires even after an absence of four and a half years from the country. The Board has not addressed any evidence that would suggest that the applicant has changed his mannerisms or associations or characteristic traits that readily identify him as a homosexual. Moreover, the applicant was stopped and assaulted by different police officers in Buenos Aires, first in 1998 and then four years later, by altogether different officers in 2002. These incidents occurred in the early hours of the morning and in isolation, during the phase of Argentinean enlightenment and public acceptance of the gay and lesbian elements of its society.
