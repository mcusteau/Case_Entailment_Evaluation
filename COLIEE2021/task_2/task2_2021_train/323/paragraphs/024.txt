The applicant submits, that the Board erred in fact by finding that the applicant was a victim of atrocious and appalling abuse at the hands of the police, but that it was not "so" atrocious or appalling to warrant acceptance. In so doing, the Board has imposed its own test for determining the compelling reasons without providing adequate reasons for so doing. The applicant further draws the attention of the Court to the decision in
Arguello-Garcia v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 635; 64 F.T.R. 307 (T.D.), in which the Federal Court confirmed that sexual assault is an atrocious and appalling form of prior persecution such that it should trigger the application of the exception provisions of section 108(4) of the
Act
. More notably, Justice William P. McKeown stated as follows:
"7. In my view the two incidents in 1981 and 1987 amount to persecution. There is detention of the Applicant for 45 days, serious physical abuse of the Applicant, sexual abuse of the Applicant and killing of his relatives. This is torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment contrary to Article 5 of the
Declaration of Human Rights
. Ill treatment of family members has constituted persecution.
Surujpal v. M.E.I.
F.C.A. A-515-84, Heald, J.A., in
Oyarzo v. M.E.I.
2 F.C. 779 at p. 782 and 783 found persecution when a 16 year old was placed in detention for three weeks where he was beaten with rifle butts and with fists and was continually interrogated. Although the Applicant was 53 at the time of the 1987 incident the facts are far more serious than in
Oyarzo
. Accordingly there is previous persecution. It was patently unreasonable for the Board to come to the opposite conclusion. In my view the Board was not competent to consider s. 2 (3) when they had already found there was no persecution."
