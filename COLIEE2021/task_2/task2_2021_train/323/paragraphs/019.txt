While I agree with the respondent's assessment of the role of the reviewing Court, this Court finds that the Board has erred in its conclusion that the applicant can return to live and work in Buenos Aires with no more than a mere possibility of persecution. The Board's decision is based on the premise that the circumstances upon which the applicant's fear of persecution is based have changed such that his application for refugee protection must be rejected based on paragraph 108(1)(e). However it failed to recognize that some of the changes it considered occurred prior to and indeed were in place on the two separate occasions when the applicant was victimized. The applicant was not only sexually assaulted but he was also noticeably physically maimed on the two separate occasions.
