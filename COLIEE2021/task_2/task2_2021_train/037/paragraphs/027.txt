  For the foregoing reasons, at the close of the hearing before me, I advised counsel that this application for judicial review would be dismissed. Counsel for the Applicant recommended certification of a question in the following terms: 
 
 
 
 Where a refugee claimant has citizenship in one country and mere resident status in another, does the RPD err if it only considers the risk of return in the country of residence and not the country of citizenship? 
 
 
 
 Counsel for the Respondent did not agree to certification of the proposed question and proposed no alternative question.
