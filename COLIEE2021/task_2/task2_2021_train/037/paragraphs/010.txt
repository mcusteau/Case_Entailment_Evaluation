  Generally speaking, decisions of the RPD based on adequacy of state protection are reviewed on a standard of reasonableness  
 simpliciter 
  [see footnote 2] although pure determination of fact within the context of a state protection analysis are reviewable on a standard of patent unreasonableness or on the basis that they were made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before the decision-maker. In  
 Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan 
  [see footnote 3], the Court wrote at paragraph 55: 
 
 
 
 A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing Court must not interfere ... .This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling ... .
