 [20] 
  The Court continued by citing  
 Kadenko v. Canada (Solicitor General 
 ) [see footnote 8] for the proposition that: 
 
 
 
 ...the more democratic a country, the more the claimant must have done to seek out the protection of his or her home state: 
 
 
 
 When the state in question is a democratic state, as in the case at bar, the claimant must do more than simply show that he or she went to see some members of the police force and that his or her efforts were unsuccessful.  
 The burden of proof that rests on the claimant is, in a way, directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state's institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all the courses of action open to him or her.
