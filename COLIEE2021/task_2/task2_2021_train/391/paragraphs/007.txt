A short overview of the matters giving rise to the Plaintiff's claim situates the findings which follow. Mr Sivitilli sourced Moroccanoil products on at least two occasions from American Industries LLC, a company which he found on the Internet and with which he had no previous dealings. In one transaction, Mr Sivitilli arranged for 10,800 bottles of the product to be sent directly to LND. In a second transaction, Mr Sivitilli arranged for 2,520 bottles of the product to be sent to LND. LND sold some of the product to Padinox. Padinox then offered the product for sale at a trade show where it was discovered, through an RCMP investigation, that the product was counterfeit. The products were then seized from Padinox.
