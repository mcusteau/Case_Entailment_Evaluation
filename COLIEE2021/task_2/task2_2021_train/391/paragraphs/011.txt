In this case, the Defendant has put no evidence forward other than a list of denials and assertions that he has no knowledge of the facts alleged. At the oral hearing, the Defendant sought to raise new assertions, none of which were supported by any evidence. For example, the Defendant suggested that because he did not have control of the product at any time, and that the product had been in transit and in a warehouse under the control of others, the product could have been mixed up or switched and that the product he sourced was real and the switched product could have been counterfeit. That suggestion is completely speculative as there is not even a scintilla of evidence to support that theory. Moreover, the Defendant admitted that he made no attempt to ascertain that the product he sourced and offered for sale was genuine, that he had never dealt with the supplier American Industries LLP previously and that he did not have control of the product at any time. Therefore, he had no knowledge of the product that he sourced and offered for sale and he cannot suggest, even if he had raised this issue in his Statement of Defence, that the product he sourced was genuine.
