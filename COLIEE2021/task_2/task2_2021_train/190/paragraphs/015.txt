  Given the background in this case, the requirement that justice not only be done but must be seen to be done, as well as the tri-partite test for a stay as set out in such cases as  
 Toth v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
  (1988), 86 N.R. 302, 6 Imm. L.R. (2d) 123 (F.C.A.) a stay is in order. A refusal to defer cannot be based on reasons which are manifestly and palpably wrong.
