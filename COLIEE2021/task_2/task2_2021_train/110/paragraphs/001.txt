 O'Reilly, J. 
 : A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board found Mr. Robert Tabaniag Baro, a citizen of the Philippines, to be inadmissible to Canada on the basis that he had misrepresented or withheld material facts from immigration authorities when his spouse, a Canadian resident, sponsored his application for permanent residence. In particular, the Board concluded that Mr. Baro had failed to disclose his true marital history.
