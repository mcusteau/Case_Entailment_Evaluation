  Mr. Baro admits that he had a previous marriage. He says he became estranged from his spouse and then, having lost touch with her entirely, obtained a declaration from a court in the Philippines presuming her to be dead. Mr. Baro did not mention these facts to Canadian immigration officials. However, his second wife notified authorities after she learned, on a visit to the Philippines, that Mr. Baro's first wife had reappeared.
