  In 1992, Mr. Baro married Elizabeth Gandeza in Lagagilang, Philippines. After the wedding, Ms. Gandeza went back to her job as a domestic worker in Hong Kong while Mr. Baro remained in the Philippines. Mr. Baro claims that he did not have Ms. Gandeza's coordinates in Hong Kong and, as a result, lost contact with her over the ensuing years.
