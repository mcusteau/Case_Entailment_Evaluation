Defendant submits that this procedure should be taxed on the basis of a Class III action rather than Class II. It is true that plaintiff's amended statement of claim did not seek relief for any ascertained amount so this would be properly classified a Class II action pursuant to s. 1(3)(b) of Tariff A. It is clear that the amounts involved had plaintiff succeeded in this action would be greatly in excess of $50,000. Defendant's sales are said to have exceeded $10.5 million and damages were being sought inter alia for conversion. Section 1(4)(a) of the Tariff permits the court to make a direction whereby a step or all of the steps of a proceeding should be classified in a class other than that in which they would otherwise fall. This was done in the case of Smith Kline & French Laboratories Ltd. et al. v. Attorney General of Canada (1986), 8 C.P.R.(3d) 422. Moreover in the case of McMillan Bloedel (Saskatchewan) Limited v. Consolboard Inc. (1981), 58 C.P.R.(2d) 100; 37 N.R. 296, it was held that costs could be awarded on a Class III basis rather than on a Class II basis in the words of Ryan, J., at page 107 C.P.R., 306 N.R.:
"... if it is established that, though specific sums are not mentioned on the face of the proceedings, a sum of more than $50,000 is significantly involved."
