In a given case, a citizenship judge is free to select between three tests decided by this Court, being the stringent test found by Justice Muldoon in
Pourghasemi, Re
, [1993] F.C.J. No. 232; 62 F.T.R. 122 (T.D.), the flexible test found by Justice Thurlow in
Papadogiorgakis, Re
, [1978] 2 F.C. 208 (T.D.), and the test stated by Justice Reed in
Koo, Re
, [1992] F.C.J. No. 1107; [1993] F.C. 286; 59 F.T.R. 27; 19 Imm. L.R.(2d) 1 (T.D.), which is an adjunct to the decision in
Re Papadogiorgakis
. In the present case, the Citizenship Judge decided to accept the more flexible approach, and, accordingly, was required to have regard to Justice Thurlow's and Justice Reed's decisions.
