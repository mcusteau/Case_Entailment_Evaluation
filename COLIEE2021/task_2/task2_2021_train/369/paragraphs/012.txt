In my opinion, the unique situation of the Applicant and his family members required very careful attention. It is very obvious from the decisions that the Citizenship Judge's thinking was dominated by the lengthy absences of the Applicants from Canada. The Citizenship Judge characterized the absences as "structural" and, as a direct consequence, found that the Applicants had not centralized their lives in Canada. Thus, the Citizenship Judge came to a finding of fact, and then provided a conclusion upon which the Applicants' citizenship applications were refused. The essential part missing in this process of reasoning is the analysis as to
why
the absences lead to the conclusion that the Applicants had not centralized their lives in Canada.
