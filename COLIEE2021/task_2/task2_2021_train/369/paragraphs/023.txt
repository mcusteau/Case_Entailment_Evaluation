It is true that, in the key four years the Applicants' absences from Canada were structural, but given the demands of their business interests, I find they are understandable as necessary. Therefore, I do not give weight to the evidence of the absences. Of primary importance, it is clear on the evidence that, even having regard to the Applicants' absences from Canada traveling around the world for business and education purposes, there is no adherence to any other country in the world but Canada as home. Therefore, I find that the Applicants had centralized their lives in Canada before making their applications.
