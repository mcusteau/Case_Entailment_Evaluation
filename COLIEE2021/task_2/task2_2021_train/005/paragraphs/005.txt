  It is my opinion that Mr. Black's re­newed application for judicial review, filed on April 6, 1999, should be struck. I con­clude that the application itself is vexatious and an abuse of process and, moreover, that the circumstances alleged in the notice of application are insufficient to support an order of mandamus.
