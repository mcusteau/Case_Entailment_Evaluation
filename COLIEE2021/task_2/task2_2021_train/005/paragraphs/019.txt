  Nevertheless, Mr. Black is not free to ignore the Court's  
 Rules 
 , in particular rules 119 and 120 which permit him to represent himself, but not any other person, human or corporate, or any office or interest unless, in exceptional circumstances, he has prior leave of the Court. He may not file any future application except in his personal capacity to represent his own interests. While the matter has not been argued in this proceeding, it is doubtful that his personal interests would provide standing for an application for judicial review against the Superintendent of Bankruptcy or the Official Receiver in relation to the estate of the bankrupt NsC Diesel Power, at least where that course of action has already been dismissed on more than one occasion.
