  For these reasons, an Order issues striking the originating application, filed on April 6, 1999, and directing that henceforth Mr. Black may not file an originating document, an application for judicial review or other relief, except where it is filed by him in his personal capacity. Any application presented which purports to be in the name of other interests he represents is not to be filed without prior leave of a judge or prothonotary of this Court. 
 
 
 
 Motion granted.
