 [16] 
  In the ordinary course, applications for judicial review are not struck, for such an application is generally considered to provide a process for expeditious review. In this case, however, I am of the opinion that the notice of application, even if it were not an abuse of the Court's process, does not disclose an arguable basis for an application for mandamus, the relief sought. This is a basis, in my opinion, that warrants striking the originating application in this case.
