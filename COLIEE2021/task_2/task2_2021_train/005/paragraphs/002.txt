  The applicant was a shareholder and an officer of NsC Diesel Power Incorporated ("NsC Diesel"), a company that is now bankrupt, and of its parent company. In his individual capacity and as a shareholder, creditor and officer of the corporation, Mr. Black has brought a number of proceedings before this Court, objecting to the conduct of the Superintendent regarding the administra­tion of the bankruptcy of NsC Diesel. He has done so, representing himself and trying to represent his corporate interests even though he is not a lawyer, acting perhaps on per­mission granted by the Associate Senior Prothonotary in other proceedings, in an action begun in 1990 which was dismissed by me on status review in 1999. [See [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 114.]
