  This present application must be granted. The decision to grant leave to appeal, if it exists, must be set aside. The matter must be sent back for re-determination by a different member, presuming that the member who made the original decision can be identified. Mr. Montesano has been put through far too much in this matter and appeared on his own behalf in front of me. He encountered parking expenses and other expenses for which he should be compensated at $20.00. He did not want to take this money but Applicant's Counsel, Ms. Noseworthy, at my insistence, not his, paid the $20.00 to him and she should be compensated by her employer for that.
