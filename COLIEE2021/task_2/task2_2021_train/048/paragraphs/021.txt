 [21] 
  Accordingly, there must be no disclosure of the content of the documents that I have found to be covered by the solicitor-client privilege under the  
 Income Tax Act 
 , nor of anything said at the hearing that would enable others to identify the content of the privileged documents, or indirectly to make use of it. Subject to that, confidentiality does not include anything else said by counsel for the taxpayer in the course of his submissions, nor, of course, the content of the material that he filed with the court in support of the application. 
 
 
 
 Order accordingly.
