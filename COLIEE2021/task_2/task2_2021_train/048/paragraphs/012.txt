  Having inspected the entries in the ledger, I have concluded that Mr. Burnett need produce only the one line entry recording the withdrawal of $97,000.42 on November 7, 1997, including the description in the third column of the nature of the withdrawal. I am prepared to infer from the information before me that the other entries do not pertain to that cheque, and are therefore not included in the requirement.
