  There is a well-recognized line of cases from the Federal Court of Appeal and this Court which has conveniently been summarized by Justice Martineau in  
 Lubana v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2003), 228 F.T.R. 43; 2003 FCT 116, that a Refugee Board must not be zealous to find an applicant not to be credible and "must not be over-vigilant in its microscopic examination of the evidence of persons who testify through interpreters and tell tales of horror in whose objective reality there is reason to believe". See the Federal Court of Appeal's decisions in  
 Attakora v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1989), 99 N.R. 168 (F.C.A.), along with  
 Owusu-Ansah v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1989), 98 N.R. 312 (F.C.A.) and  
 Frimpong v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1989), 99 N.R. 164 (F.C.A.).
