  The second case is the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in  
 Syndicat canadien de la fonction publique, section locale 301 v. Montréal (Ville) 
 , [1997] 1 S.C.R. 793; 210 N.R. 101, at paragraph 85, where Justice L'Heureux-Dubé writes the following: 
 
 
 
 "¶ 85 We must remember that the standard of review on the factual findings of an administrative tribunal is an extremely deferent one:  
 Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15 
 , [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825, per La Forest, J., at pp. 849 and 852. Courts must not revisit the facts or weigh the evidence. Only where the evidence viewed reasonably is incapable of supporting the tribunal's findings will a fact finding be patently unreasonable. An example is the allegation in this case, viz. that there is no evidence at all for a significant element of the tribunal's decision: see  
 Toronto Board of Education 
 , supra, at para. 48, per Cory, J.;  
 Lester 
 , supra, at p. 669, per McLachlin, J. Such a determination may well be made without an in-depth examination of the record:  
 National Corn Growers Assn. v. Canada (Import Tribunal) 
 , [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1324, per Gonthier, J., at p. 1370."
