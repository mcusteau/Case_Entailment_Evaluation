  I find the tribunal's zeal led it not to consider or weigh material evidence and pushed it to reach unjustifiable conclusions not supported by the evidence, for example: 
 
 
 
 1. The tribunal's finding the contradictions were so major and fundamental to justify finding that the applicant was not politically active; 
 
 
 
 2. The explanation he gave for not fleeing the country or quitting politics before August 2004, after previous incidents where he was attacked, threatened and injured which cause the tribunal to say his explanation made little sense.
