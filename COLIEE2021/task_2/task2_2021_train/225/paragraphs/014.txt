  After making its comment the applicant was a bogus claimant the tribunal discussed his itinerary and the fact the applicant travelled to Canada on a fraudulent British passport provided by a smuggler and could not provide the tribunal with copies of his airline ticket or boarding pass. The tribunal observed: "It must be noted that when a claimant enters Canada illegally, and cannot provide any proof of his itinerary by having destroyed his travel documents or given them back to the smuggler, the Board has no way of knowing where he came from, when and for how long he has been there, what route he took or how long he remained in Canada before claiming protection. This is a serious issue. The Federal Court has ruled in Elazi that this was not acceptable. Hiding the truth about his travel undermines the claimant's credibility".
