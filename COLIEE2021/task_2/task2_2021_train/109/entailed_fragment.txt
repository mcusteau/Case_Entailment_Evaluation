In my view, the officer's reasons are open to the interpretation that he did not believe the applicant and that credibility was, therefore, in issue. In those circumstances, the weight of the jurisprudence in this Court is to the effect that an officer must provide reasons as to why he/she refuses a request for an oral hearing.
