  I adopt Justice Mosley's conclusion in  
 Wa Kabongo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2008] F.T.R. Uned. 254; 2008 FC 348, at paragraph 13, where he held: 
 
 
 
 "The applicant asserts that he is precluded from raising his alternative claim in a PRRA as he did not raise it before the Panel. I disagree. PRRA officers may assess risks to claimants on return to their countries of origin where the claimed grounds have not previously been raised:  
 Zenunaj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FC 1715; [2005] F.C.J. No. 2133. Indeed, as the PRRA officer in that situation would be the first decision maker to assess the newly claimed risk, he or she would be required to review all relevant evidence, not merely that which fits the parameters set out in paragraph 113(a) of the  
 IRPA 
 :  
 Cupid v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 176; [2007] F.C.J. No. 244." 
 
 
 
 Justice Mosley's comments were more than mere obiter or judicial musings as argued by the Respondent.
