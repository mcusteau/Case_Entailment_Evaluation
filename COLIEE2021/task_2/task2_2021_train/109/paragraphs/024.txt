  The issue of military service is not determinative of the new risk. The risk is to returning asylum seekers per se not because of their avoidance of military service. The injection of military service raises an irrelevant matter which was determinative of the Applicant's case. To do so in this instance was unreasonable and engaged the Officer in an irrelevant consideration.
