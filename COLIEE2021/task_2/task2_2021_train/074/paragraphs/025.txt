  Additionally, under s. (2) of the same section, the Court is satisfied that there is a substantial risk the offender will reoffend if: 
 
 
 
 (a) first, the offender has been convicted of an offence under ss. 151 (sexual interference), 152 (invitation to sexual touching) or 153 (sexual exploitation), s. 163.1(2) (making child pornography), 163.1(3) (distributing of child pornography), 163.1(4) (possession of child pornography) or 163.1(4.1) (accessing child pornography), s. 172.1 (luring a child), s. 173(2) (exposure) or ss. 271 (sexual assault), 272 (sexual assault with a weapon) or 273 (aggravated sexual assault), or has engaged in serious conduct of a sexual nature in the commission of another offence of which the offender has been convicted; and 
 
 
 
 (b) the offender 
 
 
 
 (i) has shown a pattern of repetitive behaviour, of which the offence for which he or she has been convicted forms a part, that shows a likelihood of the offender's causing death or injury to other persons or inflicting severe psychological damage on other persons, or 
 
 
 
 (ii) by conduct in any sexual matter, including that involved in the commission of the offence for which the offender has been convicted, has shown a likelihood of causing injury, pain or other evil to other persons in the future through similar offences.
