 [37] 
  Parliament enacted a flexible residual legislative provision which serves the general purpose of the  
 Act 
  and Parliament's intention to protect society while facilitating the reintegration into society of the offender. It would be contrary to the scheme of the  
 Act 
 , read together with the applicable provisions of the  
 Cr.C. 
 , to exclude the NPB's power to impose a residency condition on a dangerous offender when such a condition is considered reasonable and necessary in the offender's particular situation, but would not be so in the case of some other offender.
