 [32] 
  The residency condition is set out in ss. 133(4.1) and 135.1(1). As the applicant noted, the residency condition is not part of the provisions listed in s. 99.1. It is specifically set out in s. 133(4.1) for an offender eligible for statutory release when certain criteria mentioned in the section have been met: 
 
 
 
 "133(4.1) In order to facilitate the successful reintegration into society of an offender, the releasing authority may, as a condition of statutory release, require that the offender reside in a community-based residential facility or in a psychiatric facility, where the releasing authority is satisfied that, in the absence of such a condition, the offender will present an undue risk to society by committing an offence listed in Schedule I before the expiration of the offender's sentence according to law."
