Ms. Osagie received her Personal Information Form ("PIF") from the Board on April 2, which meant that the deadline for filing the completed form was April 30, 2003. On the morning of April 30, Ms. Osagie met with Mr. Jesuorobo in order to complete the form. Ms. Osagie's completed PIF was then given to an employee in Mr. Jesuorobo's office with instructions to file the form with the Board that day. According to an affidavit filed by the employee, through inadvertence on the part of the employee, Ms. Osagie's PIF was not filed with the Board until May 2, 2003. Ms. Osagie deposes that Mr. Jesuorobo did not notice the error at the time.
