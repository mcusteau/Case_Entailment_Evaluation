Because it had not received Ms. Osagie's PIF within the stipulated 28-day period, a Notice to Appear for Abandonment of a Claim for Refugee Protection was sent by the Board to both Ms. Osagie and Mr. Jesuorobo, by ordinary mail, on May 9, 2003. The notice advised that since Ms. Osagie's PIF had not been filed within the 28-day time period, an abandonment hearing would be held on Monday, June 9, 2003. Because Mr. Jesuorobo had inadvertently given the Board his office address as Ms. Osagie's personal address on the PIF form, both notices were sent to Mr. Jesuorobo's office.
