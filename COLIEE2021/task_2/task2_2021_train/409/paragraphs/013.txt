I do not accept this submission. The Board was entitled to weigh the evidence before it on this point. It seems most unusual that neither notice would have reached its destination for some four weeks. Further, the only evidence before the Board on this point came from Ms. Osagie and not Mr. Jesuorobo himself, or from anyone else in his office with direct knowledge of when the notices were received. In these circumstances, I see no basis for interfering with the Board's decision on this point.
Did the Board Err in Failing to Consider the Request to Have the Abandonment Hearing Adjourned?
