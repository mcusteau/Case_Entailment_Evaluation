Having now had the opportunity to consider those additional submissions, I am of the view that this application must succeed. While the law is not always uniform in its application, it is clear that the negligent or incompetent actions of a solicitor may result in a party being denied a fair hearing:
Shirwa v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1994] 2 F.C. 51; 71 F.T.R. 136 (T.D.),
Gulishvili v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] F.C.J. No. 1667; 225 F.T.R. 248 (T.D.).
