Regardless of when the notice of the abandonment hearing was actually received by Mr. Jesuorobo's office, or when Mr. Jesuorobo himself became aware of the date set for the hearing, the evidence before the Board was clear: Ms. Osagie was never made aware that a date had been set for an abandonment hearing in relation to her refugee claim, and thus had no opportunity to appear and be heard. Equally evident from the material before the Board was that Ms. Osagie always had the ongoing intention to pursue her refugee claim.
