The test upon a motion to re-open a claim for refugee protection that has been terminated following an abandonment hearing is set out in s. 55(4) of the
Refugee Protection Division Rules
, which states:
"55(4) The Division must allow the application if it is established that there was a failure to observe a principle of natural justice."
"55(4) La Section accueille la demande sur preuve du manquement Ã  un principe de justice naturelle."
