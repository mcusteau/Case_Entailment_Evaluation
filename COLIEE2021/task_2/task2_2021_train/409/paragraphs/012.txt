Mr. Jesuorobo submits that the Board failed to provide Ms. Osagie with sufficient notice with respect to the scheduling of the abandonment hearing, and that this amounted to a breach of natural justice. There is a rebuttable presumption that a document that is served by ordinary mail will be received within seven days after mailing. In this case, Mr. Jesuorobo says, that presumption has been rebutted, and the Board should have accepted that notice of the abandonment hearing was only received on June 6, 2003.
