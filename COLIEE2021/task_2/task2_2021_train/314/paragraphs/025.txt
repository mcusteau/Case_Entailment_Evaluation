This action, however, was brought as a section 52 application, not as a judicial review of the Commissioner's refusal to change the register of the Canadian patents. I do not see how this Court can order the Commissioner to do something when he is not a party before this Court. I would think that to obtain an order directing the Commissioner to change the register, as requested in the prayer for relief, it will be necessary to make the Commissioner a party. This may be of little practical difference and not prove fatal, as counsel for the Applicant was advised by the Commissioner's counsel that the Commissioner would change the register when served with a declaration of a Court that Axia is the owner of the Canadian patents. However, I remain of the view that for an application under s. 52 of the
Patent Act
, it would be proper to make the Commissioner a party to the proceedings. As this point is not in issue, there is no need to dwell further upon it.
