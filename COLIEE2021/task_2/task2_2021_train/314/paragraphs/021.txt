As mentioned before, this is primarily a question of ownership, which must be decided by the courts in British Columbia. If this Court, extrapolating from a decision concerning U.S. patent rights, made a declaration about companion Canadian patents while the matter is being adjudicated before B.C. courts, there is a considerable risk of conflicting decisions. This should be avoided at all costs and can best be achieved by awaiting the judgment of the B.C. court in the Axia action. Once a decision is rendered, that decision can be filed with the Commissioner of Patents and, if necessary, a section 52 application under the
Patent Act
can be brought at that time.
