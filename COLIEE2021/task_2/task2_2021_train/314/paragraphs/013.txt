The Applicant suggests that the findings contained in the reasons for judgment dated April 30, 2003 of Madam Justice Allan in
MacMillan v. Kaiser et al.
, supra, are determinative of the issue. It points to the following findings in her reasons:
- She stated in respect of the 1990 Share Purchase Agreement:
"Accordingly, upon the execution of the Share Purchase Agreement, all of MacMillan's interest in Concorde was transferred to LFD and the Early Patents were then assigned to Concorde."
- She stated in respect of the 1990 Consulting Agreement:
"Accordingly, the 1990 Consulting Agreement obliged MacMillan to assign all new patents to Concorde while he was a consultant."
- She stated in respect of the 1995 Employment Agreement:
"In addition, Clause 8 provided that KIDL [Kaiser] would pay $35,000 to MacMillan as consideration for his agreement that all past, present and future patents and patentable concepts, including those registered in his name, were and would be the exclusive property of KIDL [Kaiser]. The current patents, which were listed as Schedule 'A' included all of the Early Patents and the New Patents. MacMillan received the sum of $35,000.
"MacMillan also agreed to execute any instruments needed to register the patents. He provided a 'full and irrevocable Power of Attorney to register assignments of all past, present and future Patents in the name of the Employer without further consultation or permission from the Employee'."
- She stated in respect of his claim of inducement:
"In my opinion, the 'employment' of MacMillan included all of the terms of the 1995 Employment Agreement that defined his employment. Those terms required the plaintiff to assign both the Early and New Patents to KIDL [Kaiser], prevented him from acquiring patentable rights to work done 'outside his employment', and set out the terms of his remuneration. It is significant that MacMillan, after receiving the benefit of legal advice, signed the 1995 Employment Agreement which provided for a monthly salary of $5,540 as consideration for his continued employment and $35,000 as consideration for vesting all of the patents in KIDL [Kaiser].
"Accordingly, I conclude that the express terms of the 1995 Employment Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties as to all of the terms of MacMillan's employment. Clause 23 precludes him from claiming that he was induced to continue his employment and assign the patents by the representations of Lee and Young that he would receive 10% of the shares of Concorde."
- Her overall conclusion was:
"It follows that, as a result of the terms of the 1990 Shareholders Agreement, the 1990 Consulting Agreement and the 1995 Employment Agreement, MacMillan had no interest in the Early Patents and the new Patents that were owned by Concorde and later by KIDL [Kaiser], and then validly assigned to Axia/Ames."
