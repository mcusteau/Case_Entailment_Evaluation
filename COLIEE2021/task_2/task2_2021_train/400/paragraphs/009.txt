The applicant submits that the respondents refused to process her application for an employment authorization in accordance with ss. 18 and 20 of the
Immigration Regulations
, SOR/78-172 as amended, which require that the applicant's abilities to undertake the duties set out in the Employer/Employee Agreement be assessed. The applicant submits that the respondents unduly fettered their discretion by considering irrelevant factors. The requirement that the applicant's employment in Hong Kong conform with Hong Kong immigration rules is an irrelevant consideration according to the applicant and it is an unreasonable and unwarranted requirement to ensure compliance with the
Immigration Act, Regulations
and Policy.
