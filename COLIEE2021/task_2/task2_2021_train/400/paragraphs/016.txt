Secondly, the visa officer reached the conclusion that although the applicant had been performing domestic services for Mr. Leung and his family for some time, she had shown disrespect for Hong Kong immigration rules and, therefore, would likely do the same in Canada. This concern was critical to the decision to refuse her application. The applicant's solicitors now vigorously dispute the facts associated with this contention and submit that the applicant has not breached Hong Kong immigration rules and that she had, in fact, acted in accordance with information obtained from the Hong Kong Immigration Department. The applicant deposes at para. 6 of her affidavit that:
"Upon the renewal of the contract on March 1, 1988, the Hong Kong immigration department was informed that Victor and Pinky and their children would be migrating to Canada shortly. They were also informed that I would be continuing to work in the same household but would be responsible for reporting to Victor's parents instead of Victor. Victor's parents had lived with Victor, Pinky and the children and myself since September 1984. On March 1, 1988, when the contract was renewed, we asked the Hong Kong immigration department if my contract should be transferred to Victor's parents. The response of the Hong Kong immigration department was that since I was serving the same members of the family at the same household, it was not necessary to transfer my contract."
In para. 7 of her affidavit the applicant also provided an explanation for the discrepancies with respect to her new address in Hong Kong in that she had been told that it was not necessary to file the new address until the next contract renewal in March 1990.
