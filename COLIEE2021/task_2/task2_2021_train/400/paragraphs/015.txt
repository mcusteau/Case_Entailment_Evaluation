The first issue is evidentiary. No affidavit sworn by the visa officer has been filed, but reference is made by both parties to the officer's refusal letter. Clearly I cannot accept the letter itself as evidence of anything more than the fact that the officer made the decision. In
Wang (L.) v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1991), 121 N.R. 243 (F.C.A.), Mahoney, J.A., for the court stated:
"The refusal letter is, of course, the decision subject of the application for prerogative relief and is properly to be considered by the court to which the application is made.
It is evidence of the decision made by the visa officer and the reasons he made it but it is not conclusive evidence of whether he arrived at it in the manner required by law:
in this case, whether he really did consider the evidence of the appellant's experience or whether he dealt with the application as he did to avoid a refusal under s. 11(3), which would require the concurrence of a senior immigration officer.
Any presumption that the proceedings were conducted fairly and in accordance with the law is rebuttable by extraneous evidence
which, in the present case, was limited to the appellant's deposition. It might be thought that, in the circumstances and having regard to the silence of the refusal letter as to the alternative occupation, any presumption of irregularity ought readily to be rebutted by uncontradicted, sworn testimony."
