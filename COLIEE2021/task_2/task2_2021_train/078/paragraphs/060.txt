  Moreover, it must be remembered that the Applicant was applying to come to Canada as a member of the federal skilled worker class. The question before the Officer was not whether this Applicant or his family would end up as "wards of the Crown". Rather the question is whether this person had an ability to become economically established  
 as a skilled worker 
 . The Applicant did  
 not 
  apply to come to Canada as a member of the investor class or the entrepreneur class or the self-employed persons class. The legislative framework requires an applicant to apply in a particular class. It is not up to the Officer to choose a different class if an applicant does not qualify in the class for which he applied. In this case, the Applicant chose to apply as a federal skilled worker. In assessing whether she should exercise her discretion for a substituted positive evaluation, the Officer was not required to look beyond that evidence which related to the federal skilled worker class. In the entirety of the Applicant's application record, there was simply nothing beyond what had already been assessed. His age, his work experience, his education, his wife's education, his language skills had all been evaluated in accordance with the Regulations. Everything that the Applicant has identified as positive factors for a substituted evaluation were either already included in the Officer's assessment or were not relevant to the federal skilled worker class.
