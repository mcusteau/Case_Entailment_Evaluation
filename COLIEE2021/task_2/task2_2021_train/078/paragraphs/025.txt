 [25] 
  Other than the issue of procedural fairness connected with Issue #5, the issues raised by the Applicant all involve questions of fact or mixed fact and law. The standard of reasonableness applies. This Court can only intervene in the Board's decision if it is not reasonable. That is, the decision will stand unless it does not fall "within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9 at para 47).
