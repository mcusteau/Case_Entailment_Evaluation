 [65] 
  The Applicant submits the following questions for certification: 
 
 
 
 1. Does the conjunctive requirement of "and a total of at least [X] years of completed full-time or full-time equivalent studies" in section 78 of the Regulations include  
 all 
  years of study or may officers exclude years at will: e.g., where a private school requires more years than public schools, from an unfinished program or post-graduation studies? 
 
 
 
 2. Does the number of years of pre-tertiary schooling have a bearing on the likelihood of a university-educated immigrant becoming successfully established in Canada? 
 
 
 
 3. In considering an academic program's length, is it the length of the program into which an applicant matriculated or the length of the current program? 
 
 
 
 4. May CIC equate CLB 8 to any IELTS result it fancies or must the correlation rest on a credible study and be consistent with international standards? 
 
 
 
 5. If subsection 79(3) of the Regulations requires a principled correlation of IELTS to CLB, does IELTS 6.0, on the basis of the evidence before the Court, equate to CLB 8? 
 
 
 
 6. Does the  
 Choi 
  "lock-in" principle apply to points for relatives? 
 
 
 
 7. At what point do forms and supporting documentation become "so dated that [they] cannot be used for a comprehensive and legally valid decision?"
