  The language skills assessment for the Applicant was based on the IELTS results dated August 5, 2010. The Applicant was awarded 14 points for his language skills and disputes only one aspect of the language skills assessment. His test result for "Listening" was 7.0. According to the IELTS equivalency table in OP6, s. 12.9, a score of 5.5 to 7.0 under the listening component is equivalent to a "moderate" ability or two points under s. 79(2)(b) of the Regulations. In this one category, the Applicant asserts that he should have been awarded four points, instead of two.
