  In conclusion, the apprehension of bias alleged by Mr. Leahy is not well-founded. In my view, the fact that I have dismissed previous applications brought by Mr. Leahy, as counsel, does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. Stated differently, an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - would not think that it is more likely than not that I, whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly. The motion for recusal is dismissed.
