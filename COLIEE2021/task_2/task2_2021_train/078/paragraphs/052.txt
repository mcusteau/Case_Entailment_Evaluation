  Finally, there is also no merit to the Applicant's argument that he ought to have been asked whether he had other relatives in Canada. It is trite law that the Applicant bears the burden of providing all relevant information and submissions to the Officer. As evidenced by a letter, dated August 20, 2010, sent to the Officer by the Applicant's consultant, the Applicant knew that the uncle no longer lived in Canada. He could have provided more information at that time of other relatives in Canada. He failed to do so. In the circumstances there was no obligation on the Officer to do anything further.
