  The test for disqualification of a judge is set out in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Wewayakum Indian Band v. Canada 
 , [2003] 2 SCR 259 at paragraph 60: 
 
 
 
 In Canadian law, one standard has now emerged as the criterion for disqualification. The criterion, as expressed by de Grandpr√© J. in  
 Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board 
 , [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, supra, at p. 394, is the reasonable apprehension of bias: 
 
 
 
 ... the apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. In the words of the Court of Appeal, that test is "what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically - and having thought the matter through - conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly."
