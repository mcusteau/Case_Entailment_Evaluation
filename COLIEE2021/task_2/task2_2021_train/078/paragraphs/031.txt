  The Applicant contends that he falls within s. 78(2)(f) and should have been awarded 25 points for education for having a degree at the masters level and at least 17 years of educational study. The Applicant submits that the Officer made two significant errors when assessing his education: 
 
 
 
 • she improperly treated his three-year MBA as a two-year MBA; and 
 
 
 
 • she substituted the public school 10-year norm for the actual 11-year requirement of the Applicant's private school in determining the number of years of pre-tertiary education.
