  The Officer assessed the academic credential against the AMU requirements that existed at the time the Applicant completed his degree. In 2006 - when the Applicant graduated - the standard MBA program at AMU could be completed in two years of full-time study. As noted: 
 
 
 
 When awarding points, we do so based on the amount of time it should take to complete a program of study if it were undertaken on a full-time basis. For this reason, the current Ateneo MBA program is assessed as a two year masters program, regardless of how long it takes an individual to complete their studies. PA began his studies 30 years ago in 1980, but didn't complete them. The degree he was granted in 2006 incorporated his transfer credits from the 1980s and is considered in the school that granted it to be a two-year program. For this reason, and in spite of the fact that it took PA longer to compete, we are unable to award more points than the 22 at which he was assessed. (16 years of study - ie. 10 yrs of elementary/secondary followed by 4 yrs of bachelor studies followed by 2 yrs of masters level)
