  In my view, the one question that warrants consideration is the question related to educational qualifications. In  
 Kabir v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2010 FC 995, Justice Heneghan certified the following question: 
 
 
 
 In assessing points for education under section 78 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
 , does the visa officer award points for years of full-time or full-time equivalent studies that did not contribute to obtaining the educational credential being assessed?
