  As noted above, an immigration officer has discretion to override a negative points assessment (Regulations, s. 76(3)). In this case, the Applicant made no specific request for a substituted evaluation, even though he had been advised (in a letter dated June 23, 2010) that there were problems with the assessment of his application in the federal skilled worker class.
