  The second problem with the Applicant's submissions on this issue is his reliance on  
 Hamid 
  (FC). That case was reversed by the Court of Appeal in 2006 ( 
 Hamid 
   
 v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FCA 217 [ 
 Hamid 
  (FCA)]). In  
 Hamid 
  (FCA), the Court of Appeal was required to consider whether an officer erred by excluding children that were dependants at the time that the application was submitted, but no longer met the definition of a dependant at the time the application was processed. This Court held that the status of the dependants was "locked in" as of the date of application. In overturning the decision of the lower court, the Federal Court of Appeal (at paragraph 8) concluded that: 
 
 
 
 [T]he visa officer was right to exclude Mr Hamid's two oldest sons from his visa application. In my opinion, the Regulations require that a person of 22 years of age or over who applies for a visa as a "dependent child" must meet the selection criteria of being financially dependent and a student at the time when the visa officer assesses the application. Since they had ceased to be full-time students by that time, they were not eligible for permanent resident visas as family members.
