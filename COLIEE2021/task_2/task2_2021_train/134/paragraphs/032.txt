  The officer relies on the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Position on the International Protection Needs of Asylum-Seekers from Sri Lanka, dated December 2006, to support her conclusion that the applicant does not fall within the profile of Tamils in Colombo who are specifically targeted. But this same document states that "[a] ll asylum claims of Tamils from the North or East should be favourably considered"; "[w] here individual acts of harassment do not in and of themselves constitute persecution, taken together they may cumulatively amount to a serious violation of human rights and therefore be persecutory"; "[...] there is no realistic internal flight alternative given the reach of the LTTE and the inability of the authorities to provide assured protection"; "[i] t may be noted that Tamils originating from the North and East [who are able to reach Colombo], in particular from LTTE-controlled areas, are perceived by the authorities as potential LTTE members or supporters, and are more likely to be subject to arrests, detention, abduction or even killings"; and "[n] o Tamils from the North or East should be returned forcibly until there is significant improvement in the security situation in Sri Lanka".
