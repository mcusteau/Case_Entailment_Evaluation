  I am also of the view that the officer erred in giving little probative value to the letter from a Sri Lankan lawyer submitted by the applicant for the simple reason that it contains spelling errors and is a poor quality faxed photocopy. After all, it is to be expected that a letter written by somebody who may not use English on a regular basis will contain spelling mistakes. This is no reason to conclude that the letter is not genuine and does not originate from a Sri Lankan lawyer. The same goes for the fact that a portion of the letter was not legible due to the poor quality of the faxed photocopy.
