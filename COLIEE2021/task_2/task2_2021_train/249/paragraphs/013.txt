By letter dated March 7, 1996, the applicant was advised by the visa officer that because Matthew's admission into Canada will place excessive demands on social services, the applicant's AFL would likely be refused. This conclusion was based on a Medical Notification in which the medical officer of the Singapore Immigration office, Dr. Grondin, had given a medical opinion that Matthew was mildly mentally retarded, that he would be eligible for and likely require numerous expensive and scarce social services, and, as a result, that Matthew did not fulfil the medical requirements for admission to Canada. This medical opinion had been concurred in by medical officer Dr. Giovinazzo on February 12, 1996.
