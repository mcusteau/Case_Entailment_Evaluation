[58]
This court has jurisdiction to review the reasonableness of a visa officer's decision in respect of medical opinions. In my opinion, there was sufficient evidence before the visa officer for him to doubt the reasonableness of the medical officers' opinion regarding the quality and quantity of social services required vis-Ã -vis the issue of "excessive" demands. Furthermore, as I have concluded that the medical officers ignored cogent evidence and came to an unfounded conclusion in their opinion, the visa officer erred in law in applying such an invalid opinion.
