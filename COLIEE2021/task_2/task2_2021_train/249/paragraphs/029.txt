Dr. Grondin's medical opinion was based primarily on medical reports from Dr. Swan and Dr. Betheras, the report from the psychologist, Dr. Rickard, noted above, and some correspondence from the applicant and his wife. Dr. Swan's report indicated that Matthew suffered from or had been told he had a mental disorder, joint trouble, Scheurman's disease which was treatable with physiotherapy, eye trouble, epilepsy, and had undergone several operations. In the section entitled "Prognosis," Dr. Swan noted:
"Young person with mental disability. He finds it difficult to express himself but seems to have good understanding of situations and he has a very supportive family."
