In her report dated May 22, 1996, Dr. Finegan commented on the likely demands that Matthew would place on social services specifically in London, Ontario, where he would reside with his family. Dr. Finegan had contacted Mr. Murray Hamilton, executive director of a community living programme in London for the relevant information. The gist of the information in this portion of the report is that, although waiting lists for services are generally long, it is difficult to determine what waiting lists apply in a given individual's situation. Further, the current trend for individuals such as Matthew is to stay with their parents rather than move into residential settings. Families are being asked to do more. Mr. Hamilton indicated that once Matthew arrived in London, he could be seen and assessed immediately by the supportive employment programme to determine both his readiness for work and his leisure activities, and the programmes that would best suit him. Mr. Hamilton also stressed that Matthew's arrival from an English speaking country with a similar culture would be advantageous to Matthew's integration in London.
