Three days later, the visa officer sent the applicant a letter advising:
"... The additional medical information you have provided has been reviewed by our medical officer and I regret to advise that this has not changed our decision regarding your son Matthew's medical condition. I must therefore refuse your application ..."

"MENTAL RETARDATION, MILD"
"This 17 year old applicant has mental retardation associated with a history of deleterious post-natal events, of delayed milestones and of microcephaly. His communication skills and his daily living skills approximate those of a 5 to 7 and half years old; he can take care of himself and of his personal needs as expected from an equivalent 7-8 years old child. He has received early childhood developmental program services and special educational services. Although his potential has likely been optimized by early intervention programs, it is unlikely that he will develop sufficient vocational skills to become autonomous and financially independent. While capable of simple tasks in a controlled environment, he remains dependent upon those around him for support and supervision. Should he become a permanent resident, he will be eligible for and likely require a variety of social, educational and vocational services and benefits, many of which are expensive and in short supply. His admission will place an excessive demands on social services. He is therefore inadmissible under s. 19(1)(a)(ii) of the
Immigration Act
. He also has Seizure disorder" (errors in the original)
