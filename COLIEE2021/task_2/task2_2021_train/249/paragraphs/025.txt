In
Jaferi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1995), 101 F.T.R. 145 (T.D.), Madam Justice Simpson adopted the approach to the standard of review governing a visa officer's decision in respect of medical inadmissibility as set out in
Ismaili
:
"... there is a duty [for the visa officer] to act fairly and to make sure that the medical officer's conclusion is reasonable."
