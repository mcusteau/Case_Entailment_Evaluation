On the basis of the above report, Dr. Giovinazzo concluded that there was insufficient information for an assessment, and requested additional information on December 28, 1995. Specifically, Dr. Giovinazzo noted:
"... Like you, I suspect the correct diagnosis is mental retardation.
"... It is extremely important to get an UP-TO-DATE assessment from a psychologist (or appropriate specialist) TO INCLUDE A FORMAL DETERMINATION OF IQ. As suggested in your furtherance of 6 Nov 95, I believe you feel the same way as us, i.e., this applicant probably is significantly mentally retarded ... I think you have to ask the specialist bluntly/bluntly if this client is mentally retarded/challenged and what his IQ testing indicates (i.e. if he has mild, moderate, severe, or profound mental retardation). Once you get this information back, you would be able to write up this assessment without difficulty." (emphasis in the original)
