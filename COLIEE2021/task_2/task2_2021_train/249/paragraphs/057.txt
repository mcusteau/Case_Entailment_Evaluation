[57]
It is not the role of this court to substitute its opinion for that of expert medical opinion. However, it is the role of this court to ensure that statutory requirements are met. The statutory requirement is for an individual assessment. I find, on the basis of the above, that this requirement was not met regarding an assessment of excessive demands vis-Ã -vis the particular individual concerned. The medical officers' opinion cannot be said to be a valid opinion under s. 19(1)(a)(ii). This is an error in law warranting judicial intervention.
