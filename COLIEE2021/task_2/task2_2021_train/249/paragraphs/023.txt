Both
Ahir
and
Ismaili
support the principle that an adjudicator or a visa officer has a responsibility to consider the reasonableness of the assessment by medical doctors. But, in each of those cases there were circumstances which ought to have caused the immigration officer to question the reasonableness of the doctors' opinion, not on medical grounds but upon an apparent defect in the record. In
Ahir
, the Court of Appeal set aside a decision of the Immigration Appeal Board which had reversed the determination of an adjudicator who allowed an alien to continue as a visitor in Canada. The Court of Appeal found the Immigration Appeal Board's determination to be reasonable. That case has little relevance here. In
Ismaili
, I set
aside the visa officer's negative decision where it was said to be based on medical grounds but the medical report made no reference to health and social services. In that case, I referred the matter back to the visa officer for assessment of the implications of the child's health circumstances on health and social services.
