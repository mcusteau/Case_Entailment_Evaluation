The gist of these additional reports requested by Immigration is that Matthew's language abilities "are reasonably well-developed and range from the eight to 12 year old level" (to be contrasted with the 5 to 7Â½ year old range found in Dr. Rickard's report, relied upon by the medical officers) and "he appears to have a number of competencies related to daily living," and "would likely be able to live in a placement in the community with supervision." These reports were obtained and submitted to Immigration on January 11 and 26, 1996.
