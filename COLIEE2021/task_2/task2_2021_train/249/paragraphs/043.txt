The visa officer also had before him the communication from Dr. Grondin, apparently dated February 2, 1996, indicating that Matthew was a proposed "M7" case, and that the additional information received from the applicant did not change this assessment. There was also a communication from Dr. Grondin's office, dated February 6, 1997, that confirmation had been received from Ottawa regarding the M7 assessment of Matthew, with some minor changes in profile and narrative; a letter from the speech pathologist vigorously disputing the conclusions of the psychologist's report regarding communication and daily living skills; further correspondence from Dr. Grondin noting that the new medical information did not change the profile or admissibility of the case; a letter from the applicant, dated June 7, 1996, advising that new information had been sent to Dr. Grondin via Dr. Swan. This new information included a letter from an Australian Pensions Officer concerning Matthew's disability pension, an interim report from Matthew's school regarding his degree of independence, and an occupational therapist's report concluding that work in a supported environment as most appropriate for Matthew. Although this material is included in the visa officer's affidavit, it is unclear as to whether these documents were actually before the visa officer.
