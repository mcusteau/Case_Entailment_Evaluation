  Following the examination of discovery of Bernard Sherman, Chair and C.E.O. of Apotex on July 8, 2005, the Defendants filed a further motion to strike under Rule 221 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/2004-283, s. 2. The Defendants sought, inter alia: 
 
 
 
 1) an order striking the amended claim in its entirety as it relates to SPIL; 
 
 
 
 2) an order striking out all references to any defendant apart from Roche; and 
 
 
 
 3) in the alternative, an order striking out paragraph 7 of the amended claim. 
 
 
 
 In an order released August 19, 2005, Prothonotary Aronovitch dismissed the motion. That order is the subject of the within appeal.
