 [55] 
  I concur with the views expressed of the learned Prothonotary. I find, in the circumstances, that an increased costs award is warranted. In the exercise of my discretion, I award costs to Apotex to be computed in accordance with the middle of Column IV of Tariff B of the Federal Courts Rules. If the parties are unable to agree on the quantum of the costs award, they shall correspond with the Court within ten (10) days of the date of this order. In that event, after consideration of the parties' submissions, which shall not exceed five (5) pages, I will set costs.
