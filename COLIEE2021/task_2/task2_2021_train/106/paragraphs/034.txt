  Apotex does not dispute that Hunt v. Carey, is the applicable test on motions to strike. The Defendants, however, contend that a different test is applicable in the circumstances of this case. The Defendants submit that in circumstances where the pleading party has been "caught out" as having no evidence to support its allegations, the onus of proof shifts on to that party to establish on a balance of probabilities that it has an evidentiary basis for the allegations pleaded. The Defendants argue that such circumstances arise in the case at bar. The Defendants cite Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Babcock Allatt Limited, [1983] 1 FC 487, (1982), 67 C.P.R. (2d) 135, for the principle that it is frivolous and vexatious for a party with the onus of proof to plead material facts without evidence to support the pleading. The Defendants cite Kastner v. Painblanc, (1994) 58 C.P.R. (3d) 502, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1671, for the principle that it is an abuse of the Court's process for a plaintiff to use discovery as a fishing expedition and to start a proceeding simply in the hope that "something will turn up".
