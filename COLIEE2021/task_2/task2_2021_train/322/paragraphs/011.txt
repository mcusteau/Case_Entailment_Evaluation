In answer to a question posed by the court for clarification, John Pankiw answered in this way, which the court accepts, at volume 1, pp. 99 and 100:
"A. I don't know what the question was asked, but are you talking about when the company was incorporated, and we had the understanding at that time that he be paid one-half the earnings.
The manner in which that would be done and so on was left to be sorted out down the road at the time that Cantex had paid William and Northland out. In other words, in future years when the liabilities were covered, or the equipment was paid for, at that time the agreement would be formalized, and exactly as to how that would occur was to be left to that, resolved at that time."
In fact no earnings were ever paid to William but all equipment financing and the $20,000.00 seed money were repaid to William. The latter was recorded as a loan in the books of Cantex. (Transcript: volume 1, pp. 89 and 90.)
