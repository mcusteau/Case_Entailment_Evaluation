This court finds and holds that Cantex and Northland, and that Paradise and Northland were never associated under the provisions of s. 256 of the Income Tax Act. It may be noted that the parties agree in their pleadings that Paradise, all of whose shares John owned, was so associated with Cantex, and that these two companies have always filed their income tax returns on the basis of their being so associated.
