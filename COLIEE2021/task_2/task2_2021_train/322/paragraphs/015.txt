Objectively on the evidence, he did not evince such ownership because the matter between him and John was simply and starkly unresolved at the moment shares in Cantex were to be issued - one is tempted to coin the word disresolved. It was "the arm's length problem" known, appreciated and raised by William. Their oral agreement was dissolved, frustrated and aborted, and no major agreement seems ever to have been arrived at by them until on August 14, 1981, they made a pragmatic joint submission to arbitration. It is Exhibit "A" to Exhibit 10. Whatever William and John did between the incorporation of Cantex and their agreement to make an end to their disputes through arbitration, did nothing to effect any association between Northland and Cantex or between Northland and Paradise under s. 256 of the Act. How can such association arise? The brothers succeeded in avoiding any association of their corporations. There was no conforming with the provisions of that section. William certainly exercised no control over Cantex, and he had no unilateral power to wrench direct or indirect ownership of the issued shares from John and Frances Pankiw, who never agreed to yield any shares to William. Certainly William was powerless to conjure up such ownership as is described in s. 256, and even if he could, the court finds that he always sought to avoid association of the corporations, and that no such association was ever effected pursuant to s. 256.
