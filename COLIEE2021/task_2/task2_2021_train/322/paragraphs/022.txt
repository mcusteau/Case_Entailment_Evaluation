At trial the defendant's counsel formally abandoned in all statements of defence the Minister's basis for reassessment which was pleaded thus:
"(g) in his arbitration report, dated July 1983, P.N. Thorsteinsson found William Pankiw to be a beneficial shareholder in the plaintiff corporation and found that William Pankiw had a 50% interest in the plaintiff corporation;"
That abandonment essentially obviated the thrust and utility of the testimony of the defendant's witness, Brian Rodger, senior investigator for the Department of National Revenue in Penticton, British Columbia.
