If it could be found on the evidence that there was any meeting of minds whatsoever to the effect that William's interest, if any, in Cantex was secured metaphysically by equitable shareholdings of which it was agreed that John would serve as trustee or other fiduciary, then the plaintiff would have some task to displace the Minister's contention of William's indirect ownership of not less than 10% of the issued shares of Cantex. But no one, not even William, considered that any of the issued shares belonged to William. He did not want them because of the matter, which he knew well, of association. William's appreciation of the matter of association is revealed at pp. 359 and 360 of volume 4 of the transcript. He said in Exhibit 25 at p. 2 that he did not know (despite the advice throughout of his accountants and lawyers), how to acquire these shares. He and his advisers, in common with this court, did not consider that he indirectly owned any issued shares. Northland certainly did not acknowledge any association under the Act.
