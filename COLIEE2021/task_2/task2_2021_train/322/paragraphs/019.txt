John certainly felt that something was owed to William and to that end he, and they, explored over the years some means of formalizing the obligation which had been left so undefined. Among those exploration occasions was that which occurred on May 13 and 14, 1975. On the earlier date William and John met in order to iron out last minute details. It seemed that some resolution would at last be effected to articulate their unhappy and thus far inchoate relationship. Various papers were prepared for execution at the offices of Boyle & Company, a solicitors' firm in Penticton. Mr. Edgar Dewdney was the solicitor involved in formulating the documents. The meeting took place on May 14, 1975. Present were William, John, Frances, Mr. Dewdney and his associate Richard Thompson, William's accountant, Ed Roach, and John's accountant, Dennis Hack. In their respective testimony the brothers accused each other of breaking up the meeting. The result was another abortive attempt to formalize their still inarticulate relationship in regard to Cantex and the Wiltse lands.
