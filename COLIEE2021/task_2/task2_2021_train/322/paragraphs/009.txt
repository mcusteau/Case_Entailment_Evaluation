The brothers Pankiw orally formed a plan about the shareholding of the new corporation. Initially John would take 49 of 100 shares of the corporation and William would hold 51 shares. After the new company finally paid Northland for the equipment and acquired ownership of it, then the shareholding would be changed to 51 shares for John and 49 shares for William. The venture operated under this oral agreement until a new relationship was established or more probably left hanging, with the incorporation of Cantex in February 1971. The seed money of $20,000.00 was duly recorded in the books of Cantex, but no shares were issued to William. The shares, which were issued in March 1971, were divided so that 99 shares were issued to John and one share was issued to John's wife, Frances, as earlier noted herein, right from the outset.
