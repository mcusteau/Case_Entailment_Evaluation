The applicant in this judicial review proceeding says the visa officer's decision contains two errors of law arising from her misinterpretation of the requirements of the NOC which have been incorporated into the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978, SOR/78-172, (the "
Regulations
") through definition in section 2. First, the visa officer did not assess the applicant in a "related discipline" as she was required to do, and second, the visa officer found that a specialization in interpretation, translation and terminology at the graduate level was mandatory when the NOC only says such is "usually required".
