Clearly, the word "related" does not have the same meaning as "equivalent" or "substitute". These words have different degrees of similarity or shades associated with them. "Equivalent" or "substitute" conveys the notion sameness, of being identical. Being related is more flexible in terms of linkages - association or connection is required.
