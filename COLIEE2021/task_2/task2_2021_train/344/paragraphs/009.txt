I have considered whether clause 14(4)(f) might be severed in a way so as to cut down its over broad application and applied only to those individuals who might legitimately be denied the right to vote on the grounds of mental incapacity. I have not found a way to do so, and I accept counsel for the defendant's argument that, as presently drafted, clause 14(4)(f) simply does not lend itself to that endeavour.
