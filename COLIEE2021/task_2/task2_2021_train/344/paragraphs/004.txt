It is more broadly framed than that. It denies people the right to vote on the basis of "mental disease". This clearly will include individuals who might suffer from a personality disorder which impairs their judgment in one aspect of their life only. There may be no reason on that basis to deprive them of the right to vote. What is more, clause 14(4)(f) does not deny all persons suffering from mental disease the right to vote, but only those whose liberty of movement has been restrained or whose property is under the control of a committee of estate. As counsel argued, a person mentally handicapped or suffering from a personality disorder might be supported at home or cared for by his or her family. That person would fall under neither of the categories in clause 14(4)(f) and would be entitled to vote.
