  In  
 Bouaouni v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FC 1211, Justice Blanchard underscored the need for separate consideration of s. 96 and s. 97 even where the evidentiary basis is the same. Even where the subjective element of s. 96 is not credible, the Board is required to consider the objective evidence and the different test to be applied in s. 97 - that on a balance of probabilities, a claimant would be subject to the dangers and risks in s. 97.
