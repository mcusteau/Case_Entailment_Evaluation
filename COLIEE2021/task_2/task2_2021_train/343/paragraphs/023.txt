McKeil opposes Canning's motion saying that McKeil is neither a party to the Canning action in this court nor in the Tripap action before the Quebec Superior Court; the only link is that McKeil's barges were to carry Canning's wood to Tripap; there is no commonality in legal issues, in factual questions, in the nature of the claims, in the causes of action and in the ultimate resolution of the conflict between the parties. McKeil argues that consolidation would increase time and expense for examination on discovery and trial. In respect of the stay of its action pending resolution of the Canning action and the Tripap action, McKeil asserts prejudice. McKeil suggested that the Canning third party claim in its action be severed and consolidated with Canning's action because the rights and obligations between Canning and Tripap could all be resolved in one action.
