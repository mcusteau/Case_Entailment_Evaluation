Canning defended and counterclaimed. While admitting the existence of the contract for the carriage of wood, Canning took issue with its terms and scope as well as the freight rate calculations upon which McKeil's damages were based. More critically, Canning alleged that McKeil fundamentally breached or repudiated the contract by not supplying barges on time or otherwise by not fulfilling its contractual obligations entitling Canning to terminate the contract in December 1997. Moreover, in the alternative, Canning stated that when it and McKeil entered into the contract, McKeil knew and understood that Canning would only be able to continue the contract so long as Tripap honoured its obligations to Canning and because Tripap breached its contractual commitments to purchase Canning's wood, the transportation contract was frustrated.
