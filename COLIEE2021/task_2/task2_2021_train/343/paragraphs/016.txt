On June 16, 1998, Tripap filed its third party defence to Canning's claim denying Canning's allegations or saying that it had no knowledge of them including a denial by Tripap that Tripap intervened or participated in business dealings between Canning and McKeil. Tripap added that in February 1998, it had instituted a legal proceeding in the Quebec Superior Court against Canning for $545,527.00 claiming that Canning was unlawfully withholding contract advances in that amount paid by Tripap under the wood supply contract in order to obtain discounts.
