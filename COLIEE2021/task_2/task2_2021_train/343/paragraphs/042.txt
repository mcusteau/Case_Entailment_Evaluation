Mr. Justice Wetston's reasons in
Compulife Software Inc.
(supra), built upon previous decisions of this court which are reflected, inter alia, in
Mon-Oil Limited v. Canada
, (supra), where Cullen, J., adopted the test of Reed, J., in action T-266-88:
"The applicant must also demonstrate that the respondent would suffer no appreciable prejudice or injustice if the stay is granted. As the applicable law points out it is not merely a balance of convenience test which is applied. The burden on the applicant is heavier than that."
