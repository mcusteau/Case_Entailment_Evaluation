 [7] 
  If there is a valid reason to question the claimant's credibility, the Board may draw a negative inference from a failure to provide corroborative evidence that would reasonably be expected. Much depends on the type of evidence at issue and whether it relates to a central aspect of the claim. Corroborative evidence is most valuable when it is independently generated by a neutral source. It may be unreasonable to expect a refugee claimant to generate or collect documentation not already available before fleeing. Furthermore, when the alleged assailant controls the documents at issue, as here, it would be unreasonable to expect an applicant to obtain it. In this case, there is no basis to believe that the applicant would have access to her mother's medical records or her stepfather's police credentials.
