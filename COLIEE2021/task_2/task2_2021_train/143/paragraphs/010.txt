  The Officer clearly considered the fact that the Applicant is employed in Canada. Moreover, the Officer was entitled to make note of the fact that although the Applicant has become established in Canada, her failure to regularize her status was not related to factors beyond her control. This is an appropriate consideration to weigh. The jurisprudence of this Court supports this as well. See for instance Chau v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2002), 26 Imm. L.R. (3d) 100, 2002 FCT 107 at paras. 15 and 16. In relation to other factors of establishment raised by the Applicant, the Officer was entitled to consider, inter alia, whether the Applicant had employment or relatives in St. Vincent (see Kawtharani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 162 at para. 17).
