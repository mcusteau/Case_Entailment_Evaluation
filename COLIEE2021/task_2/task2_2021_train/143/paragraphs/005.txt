  The Applicant raises essentially two arguments in support of her application for judicial review. First, she submits that the Officer’s conclusions regarding the Applicant’s degree of attachment to her family members in Canada and the impact of a separation from them is unsupported by the evidence and is arbitrary, perverse, and capricious. In her submissions, the Applicant assesses the Officer’s findings against the standard of whether a reasonable person would “desire to relieve the misfortunes of another”: Garceau v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2001), 17 Imm. L.R. (3d) 288 (Immigration Appeal Division). The Applicant argues that the evidence clearly establishes that she is an orphan and that her brother took responsibility for her and continued to support her even when he left for Canada. The Applicant claims she has no parents, no home, no support and little to return to in St. Vincent. Second, the Applicant submits that the risk of return is not a requirement to establishing H&C grounds and it was an error for the Officer to mention it in her decision.
