  In the impugned decision, the Officer notes that the Applicant has three brothers and three sisters in St. Vincent. While the applicant was between the age of 13 and 16 when her other siblings left for Canada, she did not demonstrate either that there was any particular attachment between herself and her departing siblings, or that they had taken control of her life to support her and her needs. She completed her secondary studies and finished two years of post-secondary education. Although the Applicant has some degree of attachment to her family, she has not demonstrated that a temporary separation would create any prejudice for her or her family members. She is not the sole provider for her family in Canada and has no dependents in Canada. Although she shares expenses with her sister, the lease and household expenses are in her sister’s name. The Officer also notes that since the Applicant has been in Canada, she has taken steps to integrate into Canadian society. However, the reasons for her stay in Canada were not out of her control and she never took steps to regularise her situation with Citizenship and Immigration Canada. The Applicant has not submitted that she would be exposed to any risk were she to be returned to St. Vincent. Finally, the Officer states that she has reviewed the entire file to verify that there did not exist other humanitarian grounds to support an H&C application. Accordingly, the Officer concludes that the Applicant does not meet the requisite test that making an application for permanent residence from outside of Canada would result in “unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship” for the Applicant.
