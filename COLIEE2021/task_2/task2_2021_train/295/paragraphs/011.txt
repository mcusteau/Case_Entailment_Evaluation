On the morning of the hearing on May 26, 2005, the Court made an order to adjourn. Blais, J., noted in this connection that the reasons put forward by the applicant in his application for reconsideration were serious. However, he noted that although the late filing of the respondents' record was an inconvenience, the applicant acknowledged he would suffer no undue harm if an adjournment was granted to allow him to prepare properly for the hearing of the application for judicial review. Accordingly, the Court decided to peremptorily adjourn the hearing of the application for judicial review to August 18, 2005, by conference call from Vancouver. That said, as the respondents never replied, and as provided in Rules 317 and 318, on a request for material by the applicant in his notice of application for judicial review, the Court also set a deadline for this and indicated additional deadlines for the filing, if necessary, of a supplementary affidavit by the applicant, affidavits in reply by the respondents and the holding of examinations. Further, the Court ordered the respondents to pay the applicant costs set at $500.
