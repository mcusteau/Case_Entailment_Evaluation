In view of the various aforementioned orders by the Court, the actions of the parties, the position initially taken by the respondents and all the circumstances of the case, therefore, I consider that it is in the interest of justice to hear the matter and dispose of the application for judicial review at bar on the merits so as to permit a solution to the dispute that is fair and as prompt and economical as possible, regardless of the possibility that there may be internal remedies for challenging the administrative decisions disputed by the applicant. In passing, I consider that the case at bar should be distinguished from the decisions relied on by the respondents (
