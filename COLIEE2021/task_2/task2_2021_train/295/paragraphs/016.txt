Further, according to the uncontradicted documentary evidence in the record, the Service also recognizes that computers may play an important part in the personal development of inmates. That said, the Service must at the same time assess the various risks associated with the presence of computers, peripheral equipment, software and any other data processing material in inmates' cells. This is the context in which the Commissioner on February 17, 1997, amended Directive 090 (as well as Directive 860, "Inmate's Money") to allow inmates to have computers as their personal property. Following this amendment to the institutional policy, the applicant could have a computer in his cell on certain conditions: that is, the subject to supervisory measures, such as his consent to legitimate and reasonable checks on the computer material and software and the acceptance of certain rules regarding repairs and improvements. Of course, by approving this policy the Commissioner did not thereby relinquish his power to revise Directive 090 in the future, in particular in light of technological developments and the impact that they might have on the Service's ability to make a reasonable assessment of risk.
