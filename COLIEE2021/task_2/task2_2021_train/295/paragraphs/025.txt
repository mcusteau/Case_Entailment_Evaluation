I have come to the conclusion that the application for judicial review at bar should be allowed. First, I cannot accept the respondents' argument. I note, to begin with, that a significant portion of the respondents' argument was not based on facts in evidence nor on a reasonable and coherent interpretation of the prohibitions and exceptions found in Directive 090. Secondly, it is apparent here that the penitentiary authorities acted perversely or capriciously by confiscating the applicant's computer in order to remove the TV tuner card and LS120 storage unit. Based on the conclusion I have arrived at regarding the application and scope of the exception contained in Appendix A of Directive 090, protecting the applicant's acquired rights, it is not necessary to base my reasoning on the questions of equality and discrimination against inmates suffering from a visual handicap, which were argued at the hearing by the parties.
