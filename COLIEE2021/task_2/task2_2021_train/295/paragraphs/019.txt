That said, on October 4, 2002, the Service ordered a moratorium on the purchase of new software and the updating of computers in the inmates' possession. On June 30, 2003, the Service lifted the moratorium. At the same time, inmates were no longer authorized to purchase personal computers during the 30-day admission period and any new purchase would be subject to the new provisions of Directive 090 (Appendix A). In this regard, the amended Directive stated in Appendix A that for security reasons TV tuner cards and storage units would henceforth be part of the prohibited peripheral equipment. However, the new restrictions did not apply to equipment, software and peripheral devices required to enable persons suffering from a visual or physical handicap to use their computers, when the Regional Deputy Commissioner approved it. Additionally, under the heading "Exceptions", Appendix A did state that inmates who were already authorized to have a non-compliant computer or peripheral equipment could keep them despite the fact that they did not meet the specifications set out in Appendix A. That is the applicant's situation.
