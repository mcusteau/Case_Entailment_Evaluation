Secondly, the respondents raised the issue of exhausting internal remedies. In this connection, reference must be made to sections 74 to 82 of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Regulations
, SOR/92-620 (the
Regulations
). These provisions allow an offender who is dissatisfied with an action or decision by a corrections officer to submit a written complaint to the officer's supervisor. If the supervisor then refuses to review his complaint or makes a decision that does not satisfy the offender, he may submit a grievance. His grievance may then be successively considered at one of the following three levels: the first level - the institution head; the second level - the regional head; and the third level - the Commissioner. It is clear here that the applicant's claims concerning the disputed peripheral equipment did not go beyond the first or second level. That said, the respondents acknowledged that the refusal to hear an application for judicial review on the ground that the applicant has not exhausted the grievance procedure and should first have applied to the Commissioner is a matter for the discretion of the Court.
