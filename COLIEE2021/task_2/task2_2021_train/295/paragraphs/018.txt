The uncontradicted evidence submitted by the applicant (the respondents in fact submitted no detailed affidavit in reply to the applicant's specific allegations) established on a preponderance that the applicant had a acquired right to use that questionable peripheral equipment. In this connection, it is worth noting that according to the applicant's list of personal property, an official document from the penitentiary authorities, the LS120 unit, the CD-ROM/DVD-ROM and the TV tuner card were declared "exceptions" ("grandfathered to allow authorization"). Further, on April 9, 2002 the applicant sent a letter to the National Advisory Committee on Inmates' Computers seeking a copy of the original technical standard providing that inmates with TV tuner cards before that standard came into effect could retain them in their cells. On May 3, 2002, the Senior Project Officer confirmed that the applicant could keep his TV tuner card, as provided by the technical standard of September 10, 1999.
