In the case at bar, according to the applicant's list of personal property, he clearly obtained permission from the competent penitentiary authorities prior to October 2002 to have the LS120 unit and the TV tuner card in his cell. In fact, it is even indicated that the said peripheral equipment was "grandfathered". For these reasons, I consider that the removal of the LS120 unit and TV tuner card by the prison authorities was contrary to the
Act
and to the applicant's acquired rights. (Additionally, the applicant withdrew his claims regarding the CD-ROM/ DVD-ROM unit, so that its return does not have to be considered here.) The applicant clearly had a acquired right recognized by the said policy and that right must be respected, despite the fact that it is a departure from the general policy, since that was the Commissioner's intention expressed in the part titled "Exceptions". The Commissioner's policy must be interpreted as a whole and all the provisions of Directive 090 must be interpreted so as to have logical effect. Accordingly, I cannot accept the respondents' argument. The application at bar must thus be allowed and the Service ordered to replace the TV tuner card and LS120 storage unit which the applicant had before their illegal removal in May 2004 in the applicant's computer at the expense of the Service.
