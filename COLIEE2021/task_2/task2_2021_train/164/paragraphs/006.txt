  The Board cited the Federal Court decision of  
 Zefi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FCT 636 ( 
 Zefi 
 ) in finding that vendettas and blood feuds do not have a nexus to the Convention. Moreover, the government of Albania has made sweeping statutory changes regarding blood feuds. Such changes include a twenty-five year prison sentence for those who kill in a blood feud and stiff penalties for those who threaten retaliation. These changes have begun to diminish the blood feud custom.
