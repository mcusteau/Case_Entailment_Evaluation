  Reasonableness is the appropriate standard when reviewing the Board's consideration of state protection, since state protection is a question of mixed fact and law:  
 Guzman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 
  2008 FC 490. Questions of fact also attract a standard of reasonableness ( 
 Dunsmuir 
  at paragraph 51). Thus, in considering whether or not the Board relied on erroneous findings of fact, a standard of reasonableness will apply.
