  The final issue is the appropriate award of costs for this motion. In response to the Applicants' submission that they be awarded costs on the motion, the Respondents state that costs should instead be awarded to them on the basis that they have been prejudiced by the positions taken by the Applicants in their original Notice of Application. The Respondents argue that they were put to significant expense in moving to strike the irregularities in the Notice of Application, even though that motion was not heard. The Respondents submit that the Applicants should be permitted to make the proper amendments to their Notice of Application on the payment of the costs absorbed by Canada in moving to strike parts of the Notice of Application, and on payment of their costs for responding to the present motion.
