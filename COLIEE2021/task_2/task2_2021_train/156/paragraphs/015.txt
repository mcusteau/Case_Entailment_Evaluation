  The Respondents, however, take the position that only one of the two alleged "decisions" is capable of being reviewed. They submit that the May shipment was not seized or detained by Health Canada as alleged, and as a result, there is no "decision" for the court to review with respect to that shipment. The Respondents also argue that two of the Applicants, John Doe and David Hardy, were intended recipients of the April shipment but not the May shipment, and therefore they do not have standing to challenge the decision related to the May shipment. Moreover, the Respondents submit that there is evidence that the May shipment has been released, making the issues in connection with that shipment moot.
