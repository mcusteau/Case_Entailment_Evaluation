  The importance of providing 'reasoned reasons' was reiterated by the Supreme Court three years later in R. v. Sheppard, 2002 SCC 26, where the Court noted that unsuccessful litigants should not be left in any doubt as to why he or she was not successful. Although Sheppard was a criminal case, the reasoning in that case has been applied in the administrative law context generally, and in the immigration context in particular, in cases such as Harkat (Re), [2005] F.C.J. No. 481, Mahy v. Canada, [2004] F.C.J. No. 1677, Jiang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] F.C.J. No. 597 and Ahmed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 1415.
