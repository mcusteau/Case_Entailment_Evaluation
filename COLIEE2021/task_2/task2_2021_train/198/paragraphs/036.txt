  I find that the Board's treatment of the Applicant's answers regarding the 6:30 AM meeting session was an improper and overly zealous effort to find instances of contradiction in the Applicant's testimony. Both the treatment of her answer regarding meeting times, and of the Applicant's reasons for not having read Zhaun Falun, reflect an over-vigilant, microscopic examination of the evidence in order to find the Applicant not credible (Attakora v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1989] F.C.J. No. 444 (QL) (C.A.)).
