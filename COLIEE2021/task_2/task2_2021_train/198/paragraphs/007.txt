 [7] 
  Mr. Yang claimed he did not volunteer a story, and he only helped individuals he believed were genuine refugee claimants. He said he recorded claimant's statements to form a story, but he never doubted or challenged what the claimants said. The Board noted that Mr.Yang's claim that he assessed a claimant for genuineness was inconsistent with his assertion that he did not doubt or challenge the stories they provided. When confronted with similarities between the seven narratives, Mr. Yang said that over time his writing became automatic. The Board made no finding regarding Mr. Yang's credibility but held that it would be unacceptable for Mr. Yang to assume responsibility for the issue of the Applicant's credibility.
