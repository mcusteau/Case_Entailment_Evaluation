  The Board held that the Applicant's claim was not credible. The narrative contained in her Personal Information Form (PIF) was "strikingly similar" to that of six other PIFs, and "it truly resembles a "boiler-plate" story" (Decision at page 2). The Board provided a comparison chart summarizing the contents of each Falun Gong narrative (Decision at page 3). Each narrative alleged that the claimant practised Falun Gong and continued practising after it was banned. Each claimant then joined a group of Falun Gong practitioners, but the group was raided by the PSB. In each PIF, the claimant was arrested, interrogated, beaten, and then released. Also, each claimant signed a pre-printed form denouncing Falun Gong, and requiring that she or he report regularly to the authorities. Each claimant was also required to remain in his or her place of residence.
