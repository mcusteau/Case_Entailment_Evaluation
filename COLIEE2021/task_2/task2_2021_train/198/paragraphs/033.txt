  First, the Board said the Applicant failed to mention that her Falun Gong group met at 6:30 AM at least partly as a precaution to avoid being detected by the PSB. However, the Applicant provided a clear, reasonable explanation for this omission. She explained that the group met at this time to enable group members who worked to be able to commute to work after the Falun Gong session. She then admitted that this also served as a precautionary measure. In my view, it is understandable that the Applicant forgot this measure, since it fulfilled a dual role. She clearly explained the 6:30 AM meeting time, and in my view it was unreasonable to use this testimony to negatively assess her credibility.
