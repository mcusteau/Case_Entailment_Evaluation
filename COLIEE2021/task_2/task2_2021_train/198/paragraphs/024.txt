  I turn now to the problematic issues. I have great difficulty with the Board's finding that the Applicant's story was not credible because of the "boiler-plate" nature of her PIF. Under the circumstances, this conclusion did not accord with common sense and rationality and, in my view, was patently unreasonable. The Board said: 
 
 
 
 I am aware of the requirement that I believe the claimant unless I have reason to believe otherwise (Maldonado); however, common sense tells me that seven such similar PIF narratives cannot come independently from seven different claimants who do not know each other, who have no knowledge of why the PIF narratives are so similar, who in many cases lived in widely separated Chinese cities, and who all happen to have employed the same interpreter and counsel. Given the submission of seven strikingly similar PIF narratives, on a balance of probabilities, I find this claimant's PIF narrative is insufficiently personal to be credible. The similarities are so striking that I take a negative inference with respect to the veracity of the story alleged by the claimant in this case. [Footnotes omitted.]
