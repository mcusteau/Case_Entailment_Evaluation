  The Applicant is a citizen of China. She says that she publicly practised Falun Gong in China from October 1998 until it was banned in July 1999. She claims to have practised secretly and independently thereafter until she joined a group in March 2003. The Applicant says her group was raided by the Public Security Bureau (PSB) in August 2003, and that she was arrested, detained, questioned and beaten by police. She was released two months later after signing a statement condemning Falun Gong and promising to cease practising. She was released on the conditions that she not leave her city of residence for two years and that she report to a PSB station twice weekly. She was warned that failure to comply with these conditions could lead to her arrest and further incarceration.
