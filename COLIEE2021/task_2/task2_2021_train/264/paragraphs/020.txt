As was clearly mentioned by the applicant in his record, the IAD member did not notify the Minister that he intended to cancel the direction staying the execution of the respondent's deportation order and to allow the respondent's appeal. It is clear that the Minister's representative was taken by surprise. He was not in a position to know the challenge he had to meet at the hearing. He was also denied the right to be heard before the IAD made its decision. I agree with the applicant that the failure to give proper notice in accordance with the IAD Rules requirements invalidates the decision.
