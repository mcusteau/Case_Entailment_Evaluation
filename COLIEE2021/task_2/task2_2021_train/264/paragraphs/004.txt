A report under section 27 of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (the
Act
) was issued. An inquiry was held and a removal order was issued on March 9, 1999. The respondent appealed on the ground that, having regard to all circumstances of the case, he should not be removed from Canada. On August 11, 1999, Board member Paule Champoux Ohrt ordered the deportation order to be stayed for a period of three years, with conditions. On November 6, 2002, Board member Martine Lavoie reviewed the conditions of the stay granted to the respondent. The stay was extended one year by member Lavoie.
