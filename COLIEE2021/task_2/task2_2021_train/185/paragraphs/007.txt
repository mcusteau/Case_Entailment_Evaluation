  The only issue in this application concerns state protection. As stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689, except in circumstances of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, there is a presumption that the state is capable of protecting the claimant. And clear and convincing confirmation of the state's inability to protect the claimant is required to displace this presumption.
