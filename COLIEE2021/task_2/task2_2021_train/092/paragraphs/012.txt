  With respect to the first of the three factual errors, it is the applicant's position that the Board committed a review able error by stating in its reasons that the applicant, "...[She] did not do anything that would have brought such a response from members of ZANU-PF." The applicant argues that such reasoning by the Board fails to recognize that the applicant was being targeted because she was an election monitor and a member of the MDC. The Board accepted the applicant's evidence that she was a member of the MDC. The applicant argues that the documentary evidence supports her story that MDC polling agents have been targeted, assaulted, and tortured by the ZANU-PF. The applicant asserts that the documentary evidence further supports her narrative concerning the targeting of MDC polling agents by the ZANU-PF, since it includes an account of the abduction of Mr. Nabanyama, a former member of ZANU-PF and MDC polling agent. The applicant submits that the Board ignored this relevant evidence, since it was not referred to in its decision. The applicant submits that the Board must state in clear and unmistakable terms why this evidence was rejected. The applicant also contends that assessment of plausibility should not be from a Canadian perspective, and that the Board should have considered the facts from the perspective of the persecutor.
