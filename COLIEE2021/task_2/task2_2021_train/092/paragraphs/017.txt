  At the hearing, the applicant stated that she applied for work as an election monitor at the government offices in Harare. The only qualification was that she be 18 years of age or older. The applicant testified that she provided her name, address, work phone number and the name and address of her parents. The applicant also stated that she was not asked about her political affiliation when she applied to become an election monitor. The applicant stated that there were four monitors at her station and that she did not know the political affiliations of the other three. Her job was to ensure that people did not display their political affiliations at the polling station, as the elections were to be non-partisan. I accept that the ZANU-PF party has engaged in political intimidation and violence against the opposition party MDC. However, in the circumstances of this case, given the applicant's political profile, the Board did not err in finding that she would not be targeted by the ZANU-PF by reasons of her work as a polling monitor. I am satisfied that the Board did not make a patently unreasonable finding of fact nor ignore documentary evidence in holding that the applicant's story was not plausible.
