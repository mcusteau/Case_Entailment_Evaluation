  The applicant submits that the duty of fairness required the Commission to interview him personally during its investigation, allow him an opportunity to cross-examine Canada Post's witnesses and allow him to present his case in full. The applicant submits that had he been interviewed, he would have been able to lead specific evidence regarding the claim of discrimination. The Commission, in fulfilling its duty to screen complaints, must have regard to all of the circumstances of the complaint, including all of the facts and allegations placed before it. The failure to interview him meant that the facts and circumstances that could have been gleaned directly from the applicant were not considered by the Commission in making its decision. This failure was aggravated by not giving the applicant an opportunity to cross-examine Canada Post's witnesses. Simply allowing the applicant to make written submissions in reply to the investigation report was insufficient.
