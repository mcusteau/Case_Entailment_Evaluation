  A review of the investigation report shows that each incident complained of by the applicant was addressed and that the investigator's findings were clearly set out. There is no evidence that the investigator was denied access to any information he sought. The evidence of some witnesses interviewed by the investigator appeared sympathetic to some of the applicant's allegations, but could not corroborate them. The evidence of other witnesses seriously impugned the credibility of the applicant's allegations. The investigator, on the evidence before me, appears to have been both neutral and thorough.
