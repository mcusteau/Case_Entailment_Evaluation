  After collecting information from the parties on the internal processes conducted thus far, the Commission agreed to deal with the complaint and appointed an investigator in December of 2007. In February 2008, the investigator requested Canada Post's position with respect to the complaint and additional information. In addition to reviewing corporate records and other documents, the investigator interviewed eleven Canada Post employees including the supervisors named in the complaint and a number of the applicant's co-workers. The applicant was not interviewed during the process.
