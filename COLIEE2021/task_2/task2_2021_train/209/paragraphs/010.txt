 [10] 
  In a letter dated November 14, 2008 and a corrected version dated January 20, 2009, the Commission advised the parties that, based on the investigation report and the submissions, it had decided to dismiss the complaint pursuant to paragraph 44(3)(b) of the Act because (i) the evidence gathered did not support the applicant's allegation of discrimination; and (ii) the evidence gathered did not support the allegation that Canada Post had engaged in a discriminatory policy or practice based on the grounds of race, national or ethnic origin (the decision). The result of the decision is that the complaint did not proceed to the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal (the tribunal).
