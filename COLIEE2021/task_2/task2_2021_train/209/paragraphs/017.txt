  There was no obligation to interview the applicant. The investigator interviewed a number of witnesses as part of her investigation into each of the allegations in the complaint, many of them co-workers with no allegiance to Canada Post's position. Nor was there a duty to permit cross-examination during the investigation process. In any event, the evidence of each witness was summarized in the investigation report which the applicant reviewed and commented on. There is simply no basis for the applicant's assertion that he was not provided the opportunity to present his case in full.
