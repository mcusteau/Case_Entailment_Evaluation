  The requirement of neutrality stems from the notion that administrative processes must be free of bias and free of the appearance of any bias in order to be fair. Neutrality is offended when an investigator makes conclusions in a way which may be characterized as biased and when the Commission subsequently adopts those conclusions without giving reasons (see  
 Slattery 
  above, at paragraph 50).
