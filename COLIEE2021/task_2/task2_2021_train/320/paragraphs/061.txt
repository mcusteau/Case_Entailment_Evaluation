It appears from these paragraphs that much of the Adjudicator's decision turned on whether the Bank's employees were properly informed as to the contents of the Code of Conduct. In the absence of a transcript of the evidence presented at the hearing, it is difficult to assess the extent of the evidence which was relied upon by the Adjudicator in arriving at his conclusion that the Code of Conduct was confusing. What is clear, however, is that on cross-examination, Ms. Lachappelle stated this point directly. The Applicant was not given the opportunity to re-examine her on this statement, which appears to have been greatly relied upon by the Adjudicator in reaching his ultimate conclusion.
