The Applicant argues that the Adjudicator erred in law by failing to address a central legal question, specifically, whether the Respondent's conduct in accepting the $5,000 cash gift from Mr. Birchall was a breach of the Code of Conduct. Applying the pragmatic and functional approach to ss. 240-243 of the
Labour Code
, the Applicant submits that the courts have consistently applied a standard of patent unreasonableness to matters arising within the jurisdiction of an adjudicator, including the question of "the existence of good and sufficient cause of dismissal"; see
