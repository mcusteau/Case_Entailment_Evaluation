[64]
The Applicant has noted that the Adjudicator's acceptance of both testimony of Mr. Birchall and of the Respondent, as uncontradicted, is not supported by the evidence. The Applicant has referred to a number of instances where the testimony of the Respondent was conflicting and inconsistent with that of Mr. Birchall. The Respondent, in turn, submits that such contradictions are matters of detail which did not ultimately impact upon the real issues before the Adjudicator and further, that the Adjudicator should be given deference in determinations of credibility.
