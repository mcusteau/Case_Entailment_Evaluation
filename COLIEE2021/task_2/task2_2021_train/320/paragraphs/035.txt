Next, the Applicant submits that the Adjudicator erred by failing to address whether the Respondent was justified in failing to consult the Code of Conduct in respect of the two $200 cheques and the implications of such a failure to his assessment of her credibility. On her own evidence, the Respondent did not consult the Code of Conduct or her co-workers with regard to accepting the two $200 cash payments. Further, during her interview with the Bank's investigator, the Respondent denied that she had received any other cheques or money from Mr. Birchall until she was presented with evidence of those payments.
