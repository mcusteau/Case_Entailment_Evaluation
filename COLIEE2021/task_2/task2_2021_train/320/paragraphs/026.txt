Third, with respect to the Code of Conduct, the Applicant submits that the Adjudicator's finding that the Respondent and her confidants found it to be confusing was made in a perverse and capricious manner, and without regard to the evidence before him. The Respondent testified that Ms. Lachappelle told her that the Code of Conduct did not apply to tellers. However, the Respondent did not give evidence that any other employee had so advised her. Further, the Respondent's evidence on this issue was clearly contradicted by the evidence of Ms. Lachappelle. The Applicant argued that, in his reasons, the Adjudicator suggests that more than one staff member advised the Respondent that the Code of Conduct did not apply to tellers but the Respondent's evidence is to the effect that only Ms. Lachappelle made such a statement.
