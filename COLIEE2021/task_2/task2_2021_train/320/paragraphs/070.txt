In the present case, there were two reasons for the dismissal: first, the Bank's belief that the Respondent had improperly accepted gifts in violation of the Bank's Code of Conduct and secondly, what the Bank deemed to be her untruthful and evasive explanations concerning those transactions. Consequently, the Adjudicator was mandated with reviewing whether the Applicant had any basis for complaint vis-Ã -vis the Respondent's actions and whether this provided sufficient grounds for dismissal. Only after reaching a positive answer to these questions should the Adjudicator proceed to consider whether the procedure leading to the dismissal of the Respondent was there.
