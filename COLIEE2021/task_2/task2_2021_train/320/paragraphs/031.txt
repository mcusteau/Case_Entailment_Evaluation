In the present case, the Adjudicator failed to provide an interpretation of the Code of Conduct and did not rule as to whether there had been a breach as a result of the Respondent's actions. Rather, he found that the Respondent and her co-workers found the provisions of the Code of Conduct to be confusing and that such provisions generally did not apply to bank tellers. In this regard, the Adjudicator held as follows:
"If the Bank hopes to rely on documents such as this to justify the termination of employees, particularly long tenured employees, then it must be sure that the employee is not only familiar with the document but knows and understands its content and impact; this would almost certainly entail workshops or training sessions. It is submitted that handing out a copy annually and instructing the employee to read it will not relieve the burden particularly if the potential result of a demonstrated failure to understand it is dismissal."
