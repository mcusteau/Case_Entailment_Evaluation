The Applicant also described the history and nature of her relationship with Mr. Birchall. She had met him and his wife some four or five years before, that is 1998-1999. She was invited to lunch at their home and went there a few times. Following the death of his wife in 2001, the Applicant continued to visit Mr. Birchall and had lunch with him in his home nearly every working day, over two years. This amounts to between 400 and 500 visits over the two year period.
