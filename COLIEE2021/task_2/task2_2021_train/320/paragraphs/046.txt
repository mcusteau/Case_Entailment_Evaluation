As for the evidence of Noreen Galeazzi, the Respondent argues that no one testified that she and Ms. Galeazzi studied the Code of Conduct together. The evidence is clear that the Respondent spoke with Ms. Galeazzi about her receipt of the $5,000 cheque. She argues that if the Adjudicator erred in naming Ms. Galeazzi, instead of another of her colleagues, this is insufficient to lead to the conclusion that his general findings of fact were made in a perverse or capricious manner.
