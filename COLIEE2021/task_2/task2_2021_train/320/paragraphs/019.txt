In this case, the evidence given by the Respondent and Mr. Birchall was in direct conflict on a number of occasions during the course of the hearing. For example, Mr. Birchall testified that he filled out the $5,000 cheque, whereas the Respondent's evidence was that she filled it out for him. Mr. Birchall also testified that it was his idea to write the June 2003 letter in support of the Respondent and that the letter was written in his own words. However, the Respondent gave evidence that she requested the letter, having received advice from a lawyer, and that she prepared the letter which Mr. Birchall subsequently signed.
