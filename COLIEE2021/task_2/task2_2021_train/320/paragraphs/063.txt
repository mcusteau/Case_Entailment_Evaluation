As noted above, the Applicant argued that certain critical findings of fact made by the Adjudicator were perverse and capricious and made without regard to the material before him. Noting in particular, his findings with respect to the credibility of Mr. Birchall and the Respondent. Where credibility is an issue, the courts have held that the Adjudicator is in the best position to assess credibility; see
Simard v. Transport AÃ©rien Royal et al.
(1996), 112 F.T.R. 64 (T.D.). Further, a court would have to conclude that the Tribunal made a palpable and overriding error before intervening with factual findings or determinations of credibility; see
Vantage Contracting Inc. v. Marcil et al.
(2004), 370 A.R. 191; 27 Alta. L.R.(4th) 262; 2004 ABQB 247.
