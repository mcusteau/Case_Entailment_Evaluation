  The rehearing by the Board ordered by this Court is a hearing de novo and absent any directions from the Court in remitting the case, the Board is entitled to decide the case on the merits. In finding that the applicants' claim failed on the basis of state protection, the first decision did not go on to consider the other elements of the refugee definition. Accordingly, the Federal Court's reasons in reviewing the decision were also limited to state protection. However, the applicants still need to meet all the elements of the refugee definition in order for their claim to succeed and it was open to the Board to find, regardless of the availability of state protection, that the applicants' claim failed to meet another aspect of the definition.
