  I also do not accept the submission of the applicants that the Board erred in finding that the incidents of discrimination the children faced at their schools did not rise to the level of persecution. The applicants rely on  
 Ali v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 
  [1996] FCJ No 1392 (TD), for the proposition that where the only way a child can avoid persecution is to cease attending school, asking the child to do so violates his or her right to an education and the child should therefore be found a refugee. The applicant submits that as in  
 Ali 
 , the only way the applicant children could avoid persecution was to cease attending school.
