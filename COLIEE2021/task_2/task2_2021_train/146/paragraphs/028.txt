  The Board's nexus analysis is inadequate. In finding that the home invasion and bank incidents were economically and not racially motivated, the Board quotes from the United States Department of State (DOS) Report for the proposition that while ethnic tensions persist in Guyana, the under-representation of Indo-Guyanese in the civil service and security forces was likely due to the Indo-Guyanese preferring business careers over the military. The Board also cites two Federal Court decisions as authority for the finding that opinions are divided over whether Indo-Guyanese are disproportionately targeted by criminals because of their economic or racial status and then prefers the explanation of economic affluence.
