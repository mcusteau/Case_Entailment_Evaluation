  Regarding the robberies and bank incident, the Board considered crime statistics in Guyana and concluded that the claimants were the targets of random criminality, and that their fear was based on a generalized risk to all Guyanese persons "regardless of ethnicity, gender, or race." The Board further held that where a subcategory of the population faces an increased degree of a risk, the increase does not convert a general risk to a personalized risk. Regarding the attempted rape of the female applicant during the home invasion, the Board relied on  
 Bulbarela v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2002 FCT 636, for the proposition that rape in the course of a crime does not establish nexus on the basis of gender.
