It was incumbent on the Judge to make a clear finding on the threshold question of establishment in Canada which she did not do. Even with a generous read of the reasons, it cannot be discerned that the Judge turned her mind to the above findings of the IAD and Citizenship officer which squarely contradict a finding of the Respondent's establishment in Canada during the applicable period. Having failed to expressly deal with this evidence, I am left to conclude the Judge erred by deciding the application without regard to the material before her. In the circumstances this amounts to a reviewable error.
