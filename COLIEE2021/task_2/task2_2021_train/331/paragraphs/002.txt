The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration appeals the judge's determination by way of judicial review of the decision pursuant to subsection 14(5) of the Act, on the grounds that the citizenship judge:
(1) erred in law by failing to determine whether the respondent had initially established residence in Canada;
(2) erred by making findings of fact without regard to the material before her, and
(3) failed to observe a principle of natural justice by providing inadequate reasons for her decision.
