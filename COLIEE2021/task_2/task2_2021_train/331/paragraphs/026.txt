The standard form, employed by the Citizenship Judge in this case, creates a presumption, that the Citizenship Judge is following the
Re Koo
approach to residency. There is no dispute here that the judge applied the
Re Koo
test. However, the presumption does not extend to the first stage inquiry. The Judge made no express finding as to whether or not, and when, the Respondent had established residence in Canada. At pages 3 and 4 of the notice of decision to the Minister, the Judge indicated that the Respondent's connection to Canada is very strong; his date of landing was October 24, 1998; his first trip to France was in 1999; and that, according to what he said, he always lived in Canada since 1999, but occasionally he will travel to France because of his 50% ownership in a supermarket.
