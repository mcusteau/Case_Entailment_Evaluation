[22]
The Act does not define "residency". As stated above, there has been divergence in this Court as to the test to be applied in determining whether an applicant has satisfied the residence requirements. In short, these tests are those set out in
Koo, Pourghesemi
, and
Papadogiorgakis
. A citizenship judge may adopt any of the three residency tests, and not be in error, provided they apply the relevant principles to the facts of the case.
