I am not entirely satisfied with the delay by the Minister in not yet having dealt with the humanitarian and compassionate application. respondent's counsel suggested the reason was that the application had to be sent to Vegreville, Alberta, and then returned Mississauga for further processing. In an era of fax machines, jet airplanes, couriers and other means for achieving almost immediate communication, this does not explain a delay of two months in dealing with an application when, concurrently, the Minister was also taking steps to remove the individual. Nonetheless, there does not seem to be jurisprudence to the effect that, although a humanitarian and compassionate application has not been considered, deportation cannot occur.
