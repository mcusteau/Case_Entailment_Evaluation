 [48] 
  After reviewing the record before the Board, I find that there is insufficient evidence to justify the Board's finding with respect to section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
 . The Board did not have any expert evidence to assist it in interpreting the content of the  
 Aliens Act 
 . In fact, the Board did not even have an authenticated version of the relevant statutory provisions. The Board had only an English-language version of section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
 , and even that version was not certified as an accurate translation of the original, which was presumably written in German. Further, the comments made by German consular officials cannot be deemed to constitute evidence of persons who are experts in German law. Indeed, there is no indication of the qualifications of the consular officials to give a legal opinion as to the proper interpretation of section 44(1) of the  
 Aliens Act 
 .
