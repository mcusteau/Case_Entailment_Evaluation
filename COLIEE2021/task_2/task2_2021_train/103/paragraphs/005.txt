  In 1999, the Respondent applied for and obtained a student visa from the Canadian Embassy in Bonn, Germany, for the purpose of attending school in Toronto. The Respondent arrived in Canada on September 15, 1999. Five days later, she made a claim for refugee protection against Germany on the grounds of race, nationality and political opinion. While the Respondent stated in her personal information form (PIF) that she could not return to Iran, she did not at that time make a specific claim of persecution against Iran. She did, however, amend her PIF to claim against Iran prior to her second refugee hearing.
