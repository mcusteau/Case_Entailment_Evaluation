  To establish the appropriate standard for reviewing the Board's decision in this case, it is necessary to apply the pragmatic and functional approach first set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1998] 1 S.C.R. 982; 226 N.R. 201, addendum [1998] 1 S.C.R. 1222, and re-affirmed in  
 Dr. Q., Re 
 , [2003] 1 S.C.R. 226; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170. Such an approach involves considering the following four contextual factors in order to determine the level of deference to be afforded the Board and the corresponding standard for reviewing the Board's decision: 
 
 
 
 (1) the presence or absence of a privative clause or statutory right of appeal; 
 
 
 
 (2) the expertise of the tribunal; 
 
 
 
 (3) the purposes of the legislation and the provision in particular; and 
 
 
 
 (4) the nature of the question.
