  Unlike with other findings of fact made by the Board in determining refugee claims, the criterion for establishing the "fact" in this case - that is, the content of section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
  - requires proof by way of expert evidence of that foreign law. As noted in Marvin Baer et al.,  
 Private International Law in Common Law Canada: Cases, Texts, and Materials 
  (Toronto: Emond Montgomery Publications Ltd., 2003) at page 519: 
 
 
 
 "At common law, foreign law must be proved as a matter of fact by the evidence of persons who are experts in that law. In the absence of agreement or statutory authority, it is insufficient to simply place the text of the relevant foreign statutes (even when authenticated), judicial decision, or other authority before the court. Written sources and references are normally admissible only when introduced in support of the evidence of expert witnesses in which event 'the passages and references cited by them will be treated as part of their testimony.' (See  
 Allen v. Hay 
  (1922), 64 SCR 76, at 80-81)."
