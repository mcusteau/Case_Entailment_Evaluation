  Applying the decision of Justice Rouleau, the Board fixed the relevant date for determining exclusion at September 15, 1999 - the day the Respondent arrived in Canada. In its decision, the Board examined whether under German law, the Respondent still had residency in Germany as of that date. Specifically, the Board considered section 44 - "Termination of lawful residence; continuation of restrictions" - of the  
 German Act Concerning the Entry and Residence of Aliens in the Territory of the Federal Republic 
  (the  
 Aliens Act 
 ).
