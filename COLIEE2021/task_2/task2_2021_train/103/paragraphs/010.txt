  A two-member panel of the then Convention Refugee Determination Division (the First Panel) heard the Respondent's claim on April 4, 2001. It released written reasons on May 31, 2001, on the preliminary question of exclusion. The First Panel determined that the Respondent's "temporary permanent status in Germany was null and void" as it had expired by the time of her refugee hearing, that the Respondent no longer had the right to return to Germany, and that her residence status in Germany was permanently abandoned. As a result, the panel found that Article 1E of the  
 Refugee Convention 
  did not apply to the Respondent. By letter dated June 7, 2001, the First Panel also notified the Respondent that it found her to have a well-founded fear of persecution if she were to be returned to Iran. Therefore, the panel found her to be a Convention refugee.
