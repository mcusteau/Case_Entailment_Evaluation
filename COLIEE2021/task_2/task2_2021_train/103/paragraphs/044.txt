 [44] 
  In its decision, the Board effectively concluded that the Minister could no longer establish a prima facie case that the Respondent was excluded under Article 1E at the time of her admission to Canada. In making such a finding, the Board adopted the Respondent's characterization of section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act

 "Right, okay. So, as I understand your interpretation of [section 44(1)2], the question is what was the reason the person left the country, regardless as to whether the reason was ever communicated to the [German] authorities?
