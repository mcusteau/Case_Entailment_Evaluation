  In summary, I find that there was insufficient evidence to reasonably allow the Board to find that competent authorities in Germany would have considered the Respondent to no longer have the rights and obligations afforded to German nationals as of September 15, 1999. As a result, I am of the view that the Board's conclusion is unreasonable.
