  In the circumstances of this case, I would not remit the matter back to the Board for re-determination by a differently constituted panel. I find that the matter of the Respondent's refugee claim against Iran is settled because she is not eligible for refugee protection in Canada on the basis of her residency status in Germany at the time of her admission to Canada. Further, I find that the Respondent's refugee claim against Germany is no longer an issue to be determined by the Board. The First Panel did not conclude that the Respondent had established a well-founded fear of persecution against Germany. Although not dismissing the Respondent's claim against Germany, in the end, the First Panel only found that the Respondent's refugee claim against Iran was made out. At her second refugee hearing, the Respondent essentially abandoned her claim for refugee protection against Germany by not pursuing the matter before the Board during oral testimony and in submissions by counsel. As a result, I find that there would be no purpose in sending the Respondent's refugee claim back to the Board, as her refugee claim has been fully canvassed by the Board and the Court, and the outcome has been determined: see
