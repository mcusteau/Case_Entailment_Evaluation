 [27] 
  The sole issue raised in this application for judicial review is whether the Board erred in determining that the Respondent was not subject to Article 1E of the  
 Refugee Convention 
 , and thereby excluded from refugee protection in Canada under section 98 of the  
 IRPA 
 . More specifically, the question before this Court is whether the Board erred in finding that by virtue of section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
  "competent authorities" in Germany would have considered the Respondent to have lost "the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of [German] nationality" at the time of her admission to Canada, namely, September 15, 1999.
