  Although the Board found that Article 1E did not apply to the Respondent, it continued on to determine whether the Respondent could meet the onus of rebutting a prima facie finding that Article 1E applies. The Board considered the evidence as to whether the Respondent could have reapplied and obtained a new visa from German authorities. The Board held that the lapsing of her permanent residency status left the Respondent with no automatic right to return to Germany. The Board also found that it was unlikely that the Respondent would be able to reacquire a German residency permit. After reviewing provisions in the  
 Aliens Act 
  - in particular, sections 16 and 7 which set out criteria for residency status - the Board determined that, on the balance of probabilities, the Respondent would likely be refused a residence permit.
