  That said, I am cognizant that given the passage of time it is unlikely that the Respondent would now have permanent residency status in Germany. Without deciding the matter, the evidence before the Board indicates that this is likely the case. On the merits of her claim, the Respondent had been found to be a Convention refugee and, but for her exclusion under Article 1E, she would by definition be a protected person. Since she likely has no status in Germany, her removal would be to Iran. In the circumstances, this may be an appropriate case for the Minister to exercise discretion under section 25 of the  
 IRPA 
 . In any event, should the Respondent make an application for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA), the risk assessment officer should bear in mind the Board's earlier finding that the Respondent established a well-founded fear of persecution against Iran, and that that finding was not contested by the Minister. I make this observation on the understanding that the Respondent at the moment likely has no status in Germany.
