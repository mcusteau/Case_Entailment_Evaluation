  The only evidence that supports the Board's finding that it was the subjective desire of the Respondent that determined her residency status in Germany as of September 15, 1999, is the response of Katrin Siegel, a visa officer with the German Consulate in Toronto. The Respondent's counsel had written to Ms. Siegel on February 19, 2004, with several questions, including: "Section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
  states that a residence permit lapses if the alien 'leaves the country for a reason which is inherently other than temporary'. Does this mean that the residences permit lapses in law  
 at the time 
  that the holder leaves Germany if there is no intent to return as in the case we describe?" (emphasis in original). In a response handwritten on the original letter, Ms. Siegel stated: "When you leave with the intention  
 not 
  to return, yes" (emphasis in original). Given the informality of the response, I do not find this evidence compelling, nor do I find it to be sufficient to establish the content of section 44(1)2 of the  
 Aliens Act 
 . I also note that Ms. Siegel's comment was not cited by the Board in its decision.
