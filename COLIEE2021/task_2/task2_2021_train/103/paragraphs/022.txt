 [22] 
  In its decision, the Board cited section 44(1) of the  
 Aliens Act 
  as stating the following in English: 
 
 
 
 "44(1) Except where the validity of a residence permit has expired or where it has been revoked or there is cause for cancelling it, the permit will lapse if the alien: 
 
 
 
 1. is deported, 
 
 
 
 2. leaves the country for a reason which is inherently other than temporary, 
 
 
 
 3. has left the country and has not re-entered within six months, or any longer time limit fixed by the Aliens Authority." 
 
 
 
 Of specific interest to the Board was section 44(1)2, under which a residence permit lapses if the person leaves the country "for a reason which is inherently other than temporary". The Board held that this provision applied to the Respondent, finding that "the evidence establishes that when the claimant left Germany, her intention was to remain permanently in Canada". The Board also accepted the Respondent's testimony that prior to coming to Canada she had discussed with her mother, her aunt and uncle in Germany, and her uncle in Canada her intention to seek refugee protection in Canada.
