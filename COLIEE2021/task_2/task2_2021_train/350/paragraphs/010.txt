The applicant submits that the intent of Parliament was to create an appeal process, not a second immigration hearing. Because the applicant appealed to the Board regarding errors of law, he was entitled to know whether those errors were committed. The applicant submits that even if the Board correctly considered and ruled on the substantive legal issues which were before it, the Board nonetheless erred by not ruling on whether the visa officer considered the legal issues correctly. Further, he alleges an error of law committed by the visa officer automatically entitles the applicant to a successful appeal. That is a dubious allegation.
