Nor does this court agree with the applicant's proposition that refusing to pronounce on the correctness of the visa officer's decision entitles the applicant to success on appeal. The Board's purpose is not to uphold nor to reject the visa officer's decision, but to determine whether the sponsoree is a member of the family class. Section 77(3) after all, provides for an appeal as such, not judicial review, which could mean rejecting the visa officer's decision if such were the proper course.
