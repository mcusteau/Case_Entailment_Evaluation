It is easy to imagine that some families experienced hardship because of this age requirement, and the
RIAS
states that the age 13 provision prevented adoption in cases where the adopted child was over 13 years old but was genuinely in need of parental care. This concern was raised by the Parliamentary Subcommittee on Equality, and several court actions were initiated under the
Charter
. Moreover, the age barrier was inconsistent with at least two international treaties to which Canada is a party. Therefore, Parliament raised the age limit to 19. But without the age 13 barrier, the problems which were previously experienced because of adoptions of convenience could easily reoccur. Therefore, Parliament adopted the "genuineness" criterion prohibit adoptions of convenience by permitting an assessment of the authenticity of the adoption. The
RIAS
states that the genuineness of the relationship would also preclude the ability of the child to sponsor the birth family.
