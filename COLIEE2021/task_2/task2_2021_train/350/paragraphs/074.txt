In
De Guzman v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1996), 33 Imm. L.R.(2d) 28 (Imm. App. Bd.), a panel of the Board stated at page 32:
"The question then is, what constitutes a genuine relationship of parent and child? Or more appropriately, what are the factors that could be considered in assessing the genuineness of a parent-child relationship in respect of an adoption within the meaning of the
Immigration Regulations, 1978
?
"The answer to such a question may appear to be intuitive, however, upon reflection, like all considerations involving human conditions, the answer is inherently complex. Nonetheless, guidance may be found in the commonly accepted premise that generally parents act in the best interest of their children.
"With this in mind, the panel identified some of the factors that may assist in assessing a relationship of parent and child. These are:
(a) motivation of the adopting parent(s) and;
(b) to a lesser extent, the motivation and conditions of the natural parent(s);
(c) authority and suasion of the adopting parent(s) over the adopted child;
(d) supplanting of the authority of the natural parent(s) by that of the adoptive parent(s);
(e) relationship of the adopted child with the natural parent(s) after adoption;
(f) treatment of the adopted child versus natural children by the adopting parent(s);
(g) relationship between the adopted child and adopting parent(s) before the adoption;
(h) changes flowing from the new status of the adopted child such as records, entitlements, etc., including documentary acknowledgment that the adopted child is the son or daughter of the adoptive parents; and
(i) arrangements and actions taken by the adoptive parent(s) as it relates to caring, providing and planning for the adopted child.
"
This list of factors is not exhaustive.
Some factors may not be applicable to facts of a particular case while others not included in this list may be relevant." (Emphasis added)
