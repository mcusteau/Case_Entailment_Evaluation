This review demonstrates that the relationship between the natural parents and the child after adoption is often relevant, although it is not determinative. In the case at bar, the Board reviewed the following facts:
a. Mrs. Zhao genuinely wanted to have her own child;
b. The child's name had not been changed;
c. The adoption was not generally known outside the child's natural family;
d. There was no change in the parental authority from the natural to the adoptive parents;
e. The only influence exerted by the applicant on the natural parents or on the child was sending money to the entire family;
f. The child continued to refer to her adoptive parents as "aunt" and "uncle" after the adoption;
g. The child continued to regard her natural parents as her authority and parental figures; and
h. The child would not be considered the child of the adoptive parents until she arrived in Canada, which was when a parent/child relationship would commence.
