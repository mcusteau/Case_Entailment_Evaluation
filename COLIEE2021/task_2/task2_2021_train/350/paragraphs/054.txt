The Minister submits that the statutory test requires that the adoption create a genuine relationship of parent and child, and the Board held that no such relationship was created here. Moreover, the Minister submits the statement by Madam Justice Sharlow at page 316 of
Jeerh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 167 F.T.R. 315 (T.D.), for the proposition that it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the adoption was for an immigration purpose because of the absence of a genuine relationship:
"[7] The third condition is met if Gurnek was not adopted for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada for himself or any of his relatives. The tribunal found that this condition was not met, but offered no reasons for that conclusion apart from its conclusion on the second condition. In other words the tribunal, having found that the second condition was not met, inferred that the third condition was not met either.
If the adoption did not create a genuine relationship of parent and child, it is reasonable to conclude that the purpose of the adoption was to facilitate Gurnek's immigration to Canada.
However, if the tribunal erred in finding no genuine relationship of parent and child, it must also have erred in its conclusion with respect to the third condition." (Emphasis added)
The applicant's counsel simply misinterpreted the learned judge's words. She did not mention any presumption of genuineness.
