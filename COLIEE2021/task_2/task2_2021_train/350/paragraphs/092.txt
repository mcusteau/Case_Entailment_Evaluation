The applicant did not present any facts to the Board or to this court to support this argument. The court disagrees that the best interests of this child reside in a conclusion which should be drawn from the evidence without proof or submissions by the applicant. The applicant submits that there are many deleterious effects which arise from the application of the genuineness requirement, such as "creating orphans". However, the applicant has not presented evidence to this effect, other than his counsel's assertions that this happens all of the time in his practice. Qi Wen Zhao was not at the risk which is described here. In fact, she remained with her natural parents, and it cannot be said that remaining with her natural parents was not in her best interests. The Board never required the natural parents to sever their ties, and examined the entire record before it. The court cannot speculate about the effects of the legislation without evidence before it, except to say that parents who place their children in the care of strangers to facilitate their admission to Canada epitomize the definition of an adoption of convenience.
