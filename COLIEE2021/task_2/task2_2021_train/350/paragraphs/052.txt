The appeal division member stated at page 6 of the decision:
"I find that the motives of the natural parents are to ensure a better future for their eldest child by gaining her admission to Canada. Yet I also find that this is only one purpose, as I find there is credible evidence to prove that the appellant and Mrs. Zhao wanted to bring a child into their home to create a second family. As a result they adopted the Applicant in 1994, when she was ten years of age and who would by virtue of her age require parenting. However, these findings must he considered in light of all the evidence adduced."
