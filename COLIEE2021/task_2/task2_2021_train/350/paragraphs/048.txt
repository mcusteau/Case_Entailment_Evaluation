In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Edrada
(1996), 108 F.T.R. 60 (T.D.), the Minister appealed from a decision of the Board which had allowed an appeal made by a sponsor. The Board had determined that the only issue to be decided was whether the adoption was legally valid. The court quashed the decision holding that the Board was also required to determine whether there was a parent/child relationship established because of the adoption. Mr. Justice MacKay stated at page 64:
"[18] In my view, the tribunal had a duty under then s. 2(1) of the
Regulations
, having found the foreign legal requirements for adoption were met, to determine whether the relationship of parent and child has been established between the adopting parent and the adoptee.
The definition of 'adopted' in s. 2(1) contemplates a two step process in which a determination must be made, first whether foreign adoption laws have been complied with, and second whether a relationship of parent and child is created.
"[19] In my opinion, if Parliament had intended that a determination whether an individual is considered to be adopted for the purposes of the
Act
and
Regulations
was to be based solely on compliance with the adoption laws of the applicable foreign jurisdiction, there would have been no purpose in including the phrase 'where the adoption created a relationship of parent and child'. That phrase, in my view, must be given meaning.
In order to establish an adoption for the purposes of that definition, it is necessary to demonstrate the existence of a relationship of parent and child, in addition to compliance with applicable adoption laws.
"[20] In my view the tribunal here erred in law in finding that its determination of whether Randy had been adopted for the purposes of the
Act
and
Regulations
depends solely on whether or not the adoption laws of the Philippines were satisfied so that the legal relationship of parent and child was created by the adoption.
The tribunal also had a responsibility to determine, on the facts presented, whether the adoption created, in fact, the relationship of parent and child between the respondent and Randy.
The tribunal declined to consider that question, an issue essential under the
Act
and
Regulations
. In thus declining to consider the matter the tribunal erred in law." (Emphasis added)
