And at page 6:
"Beyond the question of the purpose of the adoption is the issue of
whether the evidence proves on a balance of probabilities that the adoption creates a genuine relationship of parent and child. I find that the evidence proves, on a balance of probabilities, that such a relationship has not been created.
The child's name was not changed, nor was the fact of the adoption generally known outside the Applicant's natural family because, according to the testimony of the Applicant, people 'tended to gossip'. I find this explanation unsatisfactory, in particular as there was no indication of how or why such 'gossip' would be problematic.
I also find that the evidence proves, on a balance of probabilities, that there was no change in the parental authority from the natural to the adoptive parents. I find that the only influence exerted by the appellant on the natural parents or the Applicant is related to the money provided by him, which is intended to benefit the family as a whole and not the Applicant alone. I note, too, that the Applicant continues to refer to the appellant and his wife as her 'uncle' and 'aunt'. I find that the evidence proves that the Applicant continues to regard her natural parents as her authority and parental figures.
The evidence of the witnesses was that the Applicant would not be considered the child of the appellant and Mrs. Zhao until the girl arrives in Canada, which is when a parent and child relationship would commence. (Paragraph 7, supra)" (Emphasis added)
