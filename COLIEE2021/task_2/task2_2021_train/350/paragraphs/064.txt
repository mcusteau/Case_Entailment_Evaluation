The Minister submits that the Board did not contradict itself: an adoptive parent may want to have a child in her home, but has not yet created a parent/child relationship with the particular child. There is no inconsistency in finding that the adoption did not create a "genuine relationship of parent and child" despite the fact that Mrs. Zhao genuinely wanted to have a child of her own. The Minister urges that no adoption can be found to have occurred, because the adoptive "parents" had not created a parent-child relationship with Qi When Zhao despite Mrs, Zhao's saying she wanted a child in her home. That is hardly enough. The Immigration Appeal Division, after all, held that Mrs. Zhao genuinely wants to have her own child but in the circumstances found no genuine parent-child relationship, and correctly so. There is no inherent contradiction.
