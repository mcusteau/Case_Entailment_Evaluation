In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Sharma
(1995), 101 F.T.R. 54 (T.D.), the Minister appealed a decision by the Board which allowed an appeal by a sponsor. Mr. Justice Wetston stated at page 56:
"2. Parent and child relationship?
"[11] With respect to the second issue as to whether the adoption created a relationship of parent and child, it is clear that the Appeal Division erred in failing to assess the factual circumstances surrounding the adoption. In concluding that a valid foreign adoption results in the creation of a parent and child relationship, the Appeal Division cannot have considered the Federal Court of Appeal's decision in
Singh
, supra.
A parent and child relationship is not automatically established once the requirements of a foreign adoption have been demonstrated.
In other words, even if the adoption was within the provisions of
HAMA
, whether the adoption created a relationship of parent and child, thereby satisfying the requirements of the definition of 'adoption' contained in s. 2(1) of the
Immigration Regulations, 1978
, must still be examined. While I doubt, on these facts, that the requisite parent and child relationship has been established, that is a determination which ought to be made by the Appeal Division." (Emphasis added)
