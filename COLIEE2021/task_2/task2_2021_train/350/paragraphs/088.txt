The applicant submits that obliging the natural parents to sever their relationship with their child is not in the best interests of children. Severing ties to the child leads the natural parents to give up the responsibility before the adoptive parents can assume responsibility for the child in Canada. To comply with Canadian immigration requirements, children are often put into the care of friends, relatives, or strangers by power of attorney. This abandonment continues during the immigration process, and these children become effectively orphaned if the application is unsuccessful. Therefore, the applicant submits that it is in the best interests of adopted children to encourage their natural parents to keep caring for them until they arrive in Canada.
