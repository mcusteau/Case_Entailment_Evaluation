In particular, I note that the Refugee Division found that if the principal applicant genuinely feared returning to Turkey, he would have had his family join him in North America, after his initial departure from that country, rather than risking additional harm by returning. Further, the Refugee Division did not find it reasonable that the applicants, because they had found a good obstetrician, would remain in the United States ("U.S.") with no status and at risk of deportation to the country they allegedly fear, without either making a claim for protection or proceeding to Canada, which was only a few hours away by car. The Refugee Division found the applicants' behaviour "entirely inconsistent with a well-founded fear of persecution", and noted case law stating that a lack of evidence going to the subjective element of a claim is, on its own, fatal to the claim. The Refugee Division went on to find that the applicants had not established that their claim was objectively well-founded. In particular, it noted that the documentary evidence did not support the applicants' claim of a well-founded fear of persecution in Turkey by reason of being Fetullah Gulen supporters. The Refugee Division cited evidence which provided that the Gulen movement was on relatively good terms with state authorities, was less likely to suffer from abuses or from the state's repressive policies than other Islamic groups, and had accumulated significant amounts of social, economic, and political power. Further, the Refugee Division found that while the female and minor applicants may face discrimination in Turkey, they would not face persecution. Accordingly, it found that the applicants were not Convention refugees in a decision dated June 24, 2002. The applicants' application for leave and for judicial review of that decision was dismissed by this Court.
