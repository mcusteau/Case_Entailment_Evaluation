Martineau, J.
: The applicants have brought a motion for a stay of execution of the removal order now being scheduled for July 17, 2003 on the grounds that there is a serious issue to be tried, that they will suffer irreparable harm and that the balance of convenience favours the applicants. These are the reasons previously delivered orally, denying this motion, which have been edited for syntax and grammar with added references to the relevant case law.
