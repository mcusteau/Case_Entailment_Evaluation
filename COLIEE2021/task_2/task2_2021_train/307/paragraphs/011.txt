Sixth, the deportation of individuals while they have outstanding leave applications and/or other litigation before the Court, is not a serious issue nor does it constitute irreparable harm: Ward v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] F.C.J. No. 86 (T.D.) at para. 12; and Owusu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1995] F.C.J. No. 1166 (T.D.). I also note that the application for leave and judicial review will continue regardless of where the applicants are located, and that they can provide instructions to counsel as to how to proceed with the litigation from the U.S. or, should they end up there, Turkey. Further, this Court cannot speculate on whether foreign authorities might detain or arrest the applicants, even if such detention or arrest would have the consequence of rendering any further decision moot should an outstanding application for leave and for judicial review be granted: Blum v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1994), 90 F.T.R. 54 at para. 8; see also Karthigesu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 153 F.T.R. 204; and Bada v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1992), 56 F.T.R. 106 at 107.
