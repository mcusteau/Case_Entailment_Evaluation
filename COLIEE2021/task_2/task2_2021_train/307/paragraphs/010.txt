Fifth, I also accept the respondent's submission that the alleged U.S. detention does not constitute irreparable harm in the present circumstances. The Court notes that this allegation is based on the affidavit of Burhan Celik, a member of the Turkish community in Canada and friend of the applicants, who ostensibly made a call to a U.S. lawyer who gave the opinion that the applicants would be detained in the U.S. and that the conditions of detention would be similar to that of a Gulag. The principal applicant's affidavit also mentions being aware of "terrible conditions" in U.S. detention, but does not make clear the source of this information. The Court also notes that there are absolutely no details provided about the alleged terrible conditions, and that there is no sworn evidence from this U.S. lawyer in the record. Further, there is no objective documentary evidence in the record to establish that detention conditions in the U.S. would be so intolerable as to constitute irreparable harm. Further, even if the applicants are detained, it has to be assumed that the U.S. authorities will treat them fairly. Recently, this Court in Nabut v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] F.C.J. No. 1878, 2001 FCT 1392 ("Nabut") considered a claimant's argument that, as he was an Arab and was suspected of being associated with terrorists, his removal to the U.S. would result in irreparable harm as his human rights might not be respected during a long period of incarceration. Rejecting this argument, the Court followed the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Satiacum (F.C.A.) (1989), 99 N.R. 171 and held that it was prepared to assume that the applicant would receive due process and a fair trial in the U.S.: Nabut, supra, at para. 8; and Mikhailov v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 191 F.T.R. 1.
