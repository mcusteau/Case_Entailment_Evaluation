[4]
On June 26, 1985, the applicant appeared before the Segregation Review Board and was asked to provide the names of the prisoners who had threatened him and those whom the applicant believed wished to cause him physical harm. The applicant refused to supply the prison officials with any names for fear of the consequences of doing so. In paragraph 4 of his affidavit sworn on April 3, 1986, the applicant states:
"[...] The reason I did this was because any repercussions against these individuals would be easily traced to me as I had just signed myself into Protective Custody. Even if I had remained in Protective Custody until the end of my sentence, I was apprehensive that I would be severely injured or killed upon my release from prison in 1989, in retaliation."
