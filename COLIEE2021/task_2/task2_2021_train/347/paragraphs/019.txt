With due respect to counsel it is my opinion that they have misdirected themselves on this issue of mens rea. The mens rea attached to the offence of threatening another party by one's language is the intent to speak the words while the actus reus of the offence is the actual speaking of the words. The question of whether the person who actually says the threatening words has the intention of carrying out the threat is irrelevant; that intention does not constitute an element of the offence of threatening another person by one's language. It is immaterial whether those who heard the threat or those being threatened appreciated that the words were uttered for a secondary motive. It is only required that the person accused of the offence in paragraph 39(g) of the Regulations actually behaved by his language in a threatening manner. Accordingly, an inmate charged with an offence pursuant to paragraph 39(g) does not need to possess the intention of actually carrying out the threat in order to be guilty of the offence.
