[24]
Because this issue was not addressed by counsel in the course of the hearing before me, I think the appropriate action in this matter is to have both counsel make submissions on this point before I render a decision. Accordingly, I am ordering the applicant to provide to the respondent and to file with this court written submissions within twenty days of this order on the issue of whether the applicant has been charged with the proper offence pursuant to regulation 39. The respondent will be afforded twenty days from the date of receiving the applicant's submissions to file his written arguments with the court and to serve them on the applicant. Thereafter, the applicant will have ten days to file and serve a reply.
Order accordingly.
