As for the applicant's alternative argument that this court has jurisdiction in its supervisory capacity to stay the charge, I cannot agree. The remedies available to the applicant pursuant to a review of this nature are clearly set out in s. 18 of the Federal Court Act. Certiorari, which permits the court to review the record of an inferior tribunal and to quash the order where proper grounds are shown, is one of the general remedies available to the court when exercising its supervisory function over the decision making of a public body. However, the court is not empowered in its supervisory capacity to make the type of decision which the applicant is requesting. As I have already stated, the decision to stay the charge does not rest with the Disciplinary Court. This court is not conducting a procedural review of that decision-making process, i.e. the withdrawing of charges, rests with the head of the institution; at the most it has the power to quash the decision of an inferior tribunal where proper grounds are shown.
