The second ground on which the applicant seeks the remedy of certiorari is that the respondent misdirected himself in law by finding that mens rea was not a necessary element of the charge against the applicant. Section 39 of the Penitentiary Service Regulations provides as follows:
"39. Every inmate is guilty of a disciplinary offence who
(a) disobeys or fails to obey a lawful order of a penitentiary officer,
(b) assaults or threatens to assault another person,
(c) refuses to work or fails to work to the best of his ability,
(d) leaves his work without permission of a penitentiary officer,
(e) wilfully or negligently damages any property of Her Majesty or the property of another person,
(f) wilfully wastes food,
(g) behaves toward any other person, by his actions, language or writing, in an indecent, disrespectful, threatening or defamatory manner,
(h) wilfully disobeys or fails to obey any regulation or rule governing the conduct of inmates,
(i) has contraband in his possession,
(i.1) consumes, absorbs, swallows, smokes, inhales, injects or otherwise uses an intoxicant.
(j) deals in contraband with any other person,
(k) does any act that is calculated to prejudice the discipline or good order of the institution,
(l) does any act with intent to escape or to assist another inmate to escape,
(l.1) is in an area prohibited to inmates,
(m) gives or offers a bribe or reward to any person for any purpose,
(n) contravenes any rule, regulation or directive made under the Act, or
(o) attempts to do anything mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (n)."
Counsel for the applicant maintains that, in the circumstances of this case, it is clear that the applicant did not possess the intent to carry out his threat of killing a staff member and only uttered the threat in order to remain in protective custody. Accordingly, the applicant argues that the necessary mens rea was not present and the offence with which the applicant has been charged under paragraph 39(g) has not been made out.
