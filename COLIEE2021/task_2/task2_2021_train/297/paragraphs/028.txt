Is this a proper case for accepting the amendment of the Notice of Motion as a proper basis for considering review of the decision to disclose the Proposal, assuming the court has authority to so act? The applicant relies on its amendment, in August 1993, of the application originally filed in April 1992. No application for leave to amend was presented. The respondent objects at the time of the hearing to the amendment, and in my opinion, that objection must be upheld in the absence of any explanation of delay in filing an amended application until 15 months after the applicant knew of the decision that its Proposal was to be disclosed to the requester, and in the absence of argument that warrants considering this to be an extraordinary or exceptional case.
