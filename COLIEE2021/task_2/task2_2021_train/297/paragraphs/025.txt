I do not agree with the implication of the respondent's submission on this point, that the court, even in an appropriate case, may not allow an amendment to an application or a Notice of Motion. While the court's
Rules
have no counterparts, for applications, to rules 420 to 428 which concern amendments to pleadings in actions, rule 303 is a general provision for amendment of any document except a judgment or order. It provides:
"303(1) For the purpose of determining the real question in controversy, or of correcting any defect of error, the court may, at any stage of a proceeding, and after giving all interested parties an opportunity to be heard, order any document in the matter to be amended on such terms as seem just, and in such manner as it may direct.
"(2) This rule does not apply to a judgment or order."
In my view, rule 303 provides a basis for the court, in an appropriate case, to admit amendments to applications, particularly in light of rule 2(2) which sets out the general purpose of the rule as
"... intended to render effective the substantive law and to ensure that it is carried out; and they are to be so interpreted and applied as to facilitate rather than to delay or to end prematurely the normal advancement of cases."
