[45]
As indicated earlier, upon examination of the Proposal it is my view that portions of it are exempt from disclosure in accord with paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
Act
and other portions are not so exempt. The respondent has an obligation, pursuant to s. 25 of the
Act
to disclose any part of the Proposal that does not contain, and can reasonably be severed from any part that does contain, information described in paragraph 20(1)(b) that he is required to refuse to disclose. Section 25 of the
Act
provides:
"25. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where a request is made to a government institution for access to a record that the head of the institution is authorized to refuse to disclose under this Act by reason of information or other material contained in the record, the head of the institution shall disclose any part of the record that does not contain, and can reasonably be severed from any part that contains, any such information or material."
