[56]
If I should be found in error in declining to exercise any discretion the court may have to review the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal, then in my view portions of that Proposal as indicated in these Reasons, identified as Exhibits "E" and "N" to the confidential affidavit of MacCoul, sworn October 18, 1993 (Court File T-1133-92), except for published financial or annual statements of public companies associated with the applicant in the joint venture, should be considered exempt from disclosure pursuant to paragraph 20(1)(b). The balance of the Proposal, not being information that is confidential in nature, by any objective standard, should be released as reasonably severable.
