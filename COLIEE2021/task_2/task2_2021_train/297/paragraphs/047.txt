Both positions, in my view, are unreasonable. For example, in my opinion some information in the Proposal is clearly not exempt from disclosure because on its face it is not confidential information within paragraph 20(1)(b). Thus, for example, the Proposal includes considerable printed material from other sources which can hardly be described as confidential, e.g., the published financial statements of partners in the venture which were both publicly owned corporations, summary reviews of other projects in which the applicant was previously involved, summaries of experience and curriculum vitae of those who would provide leadership if the project were to proceed. But aside from that kind of information, other portions, especially of the financial aspects of the proposal would appear clearly to be confidential within paragraph 20(1)(b) and s. 20 imposes a responsibility on the respondent to refuse to disclose that. This responsibility is not discharged by saying to the third party who may be affected by disclosure "Here is information that relates to you. It may contain information that should not be disclosed but I will release it as requested unless you prove by evidence satisfactory to me (or to a court on an application to review) that the information ought not to be disclosed under the
Act
". While it is true that on review under s. 44(1) the burden is on the applicant seeking to restrain disclosure, the actual responsibility to refuse to disclose the information under s. 20 is that of the head of the institution, in this case the respondent. In my opinion that responsibility has been taken too lightly in this case.
