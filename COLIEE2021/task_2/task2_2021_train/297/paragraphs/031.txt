In the event my conclusion is found on appeal to be in error and that the decision to disclose the applicant's Proposal is properly before the court by the applicant's Amended Notice of Motion, I turn to the substantive question whether, as the applicant claims, it is information that is "confidential" within paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
Act
, as the applicant claims. If so, it may not be disclosed.
