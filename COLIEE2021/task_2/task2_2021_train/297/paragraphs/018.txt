The respondent urges that in view of s. 44(1), since the application was not filed within 20 days, it is out of time. No application for an extension of time was filed and it is submitted that the court has no discretion to extend the time for filing where the
Act
providing for the process does not so provide. (See:
Miucci v. Ministre du Revenue national
(1991), 52 F.T.R. 216 (T.D.), where Mr. Justice Pinard applied this principle in relation to proceedings under s. 135(1) of the
Customs Act
, R.S.C. 1985 (2nd Supp.), c. 1; upheld on appeal, unreported, Court File A-1148-91, December 7, 1993 (F.C.A.). See also the variation in application of the principle where the applicant, acting on his own behalf, wrote to the court within the time prescribed, indicating the intent to apply under s. 135(1) of the
Customs Act
but did not file documents to initiate action within the time prescribed, yet the Crown's motion to strike the statement of claim was dismissed:
Forsythe v. Minister of National Revenue (Customs and Excise)
(1994), 72 F.T.R. 74 (T.D.). That case followed
Dawe v. Minister of National Revenue (Customs and Excise)
(1993), 63 F.T.R. 316 (T.D.), which was then on appeal. See also, contra,
Sharma v. Minister of National Revenue
(1994), 74 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.), now on appeal.) Here no provision for an extension of time to file is included in the
Act
. In these circumstances it is urged the court has no discretion to exercise and the application made May 15, 1992, in relation to the decision to disclose the Proposal must be dismissed.
