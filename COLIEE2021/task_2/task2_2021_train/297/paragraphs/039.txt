[39]
I am not satisfied that all of the information in the Proposal was available only from the applicant and not from sources otherwise accessible to the public. Some of the information, it seems to me, may qualify as confidential in that it would not be available from sources otherwise accessible by the public, but other portions of the information are of the sort that may be accessible to the public aside from the proposals submitted by the applicant. I deal with this matter further, in considering severability, below.
Are The Record And The Proposal
Exempt From Disclosure Under
Paragraphs 20(1)(c) And 20(1)(d)
Of The Act?
