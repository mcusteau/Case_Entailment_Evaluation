  The relevant portion of the Officer's letter providing the reason for awarding Mr. Barboza 66 points is as follows: 
 
 
 
 You have not obtained the minimum number of points, currently 67, required for a permanent resident visa.  
 I gave you 15 points for Experience. You only provided evidence of employment from August 2008 (letter of job offer) to November 2009 (description of duties), more than 1 year but less than 2. You provided no Schedule 1 form for your spouse. As a result I cannot determine how many years of education was taken to obtain the Bachelor's degree, hence 0 point was awarded for Spousal education. 
  You have therefore not satisfied me that you will be able to become economically established in Canada. [Emphasis in original]
