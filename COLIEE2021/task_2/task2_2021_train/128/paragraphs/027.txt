  On reading the Officer's affidavit and comparing it with the reasons given in the letter and the CAIPS notes, I am satisfied the Officer is providing additional reasons to support his decision. By listing the additional documents and then questioning the Applicant's employment of banking operations manager, the Officer engaged in supplementing his reasons.
