  In  
 Khatun v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2011 FC 3 at paragraphs 9-10, Justice Pinard of this Court commented on a respondent's ability to rely on an immigration officer's affidavit supplementing the officer's reasons provided in the decision letter. As Justice Pinard stated: 
 
 
 
 [9] The respondent submitted an affidavit from the deciding Officer, Patricia Brown. In this affidavit, Ms. Brown explains her decision in detail. 
 
 
 
 [10] The respondent relies on this affidavit, as well as the Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System (CAIPS) notes that repeat a portion of these reasons, as evidence of sufficient reasons.  
 However, in my opinion, the respondent cannot use this affidavit to supplement the reasons provided in the decision letter. There has been consistent jurisprudence from this Court to the effect that the respondent cannot submit an affidavit during the judicial review proceedings in an attempt to buttress the reasons provided in the decision
