  The Applicant had provided a certificate from the University of Mumbai conferring the Applicant's spouse with a Bachelor's Degree of Commerce (Three-year Integrated Course). In addition, he indicated in his own application for permanent residence form IMM-0008 that his spouse's years of education totalled 15 years. In result, the Officer had the information, albeit on the wrong form, of the spouse's 15 years of education in addition to evidence of her Degree which, contrary to the Officer's CAIPS notes, indicates the Bachelor's Degree was from the University of Mumbai.
