  In my view, the Applicant's evidence could support his contention that he continued in essentially the same position of manager with Lloyds TBS. After all, the Officer accepted he occupied a position that met the requirements for the skilled worker position for the period August 2008 to November 2009 and there is no evidence that the Applicant left the position in November 2009. The Officer was required to assess the Applicant's post November 2009 documentation in coming to a determination about the Applicant's work experience. The Officer did not do so.
