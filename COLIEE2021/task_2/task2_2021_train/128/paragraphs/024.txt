  The Respondent submits the Officer had questions about the Applicant's actual position with Lloyds TBS but gave him the benefit of the doubt as explained in his affidavit. The Respondent submits the Officer had reason not to accept that the Applicant worked in the same position after November 2009 since the contract of employment as a banking operations manager dated March 25, 2010 provided no details about the duties of the position or confirmation that the Applicant actually worked in the position of banking operations manager. The Respondent submits the Officer is providing an explanation, not supplemental reasons, in his affidavit.
