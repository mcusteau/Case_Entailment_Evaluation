In my view the Federal Court of Appeal has determined that the determination of change in circumstances is a mixed question of fact and law. Accordingly, the Board needs to provide a sufficient explanation of the facts in order that the reviewing court may determine if the appropriate legal prin­ciples were applied. The Minister submitted that even if it was necessary to review the conflicting evidence in this matter the Board had done so at p. 3 of the Reasons:
"The claimant testified that he heard about the planned presidential and parliamentary elections as well as the release of coup-plotters and many others. He further tes­tified that he heard about lifting the ban on the political parties. Asked if those changes made him feel comfortable to return, he replied that those changes would not help his case in any way and made reference to the letter of the CDR."
