  In  
 Misquadis 
 , supra, Mr. Justice Lemieux gave leave to file affidavit evidence dealing with the function of aboriginal communities in various cities. In the present instance Ms. Edgar has leave to file affidavit evidence exhibiting the 5 April 2003 letter from the Kitasoo-Xaixais Police Department and the 14 May 2003 letter from the Kitasoo Council, together with any other evidence, including fresh facts, addressing the ongoing effect of the Band Council Resolution and the nature of that effect, since her return to the community following the 14 February 2003 resolution of the Band Council Resolution. This material would be of assistance in providing an adequate pool of evidence thus allowing the Court to have a more full grasp of the overall evidence and situation. Such after-the-event material is also relevant: see for example  
 Tahsis Co. Ltd. v. Vancouver Tug Boat Co. Ltd. 
 , [1969] S.C.R. 12, at 34, where Mr. Justice Pigeon considered recommendations and loading instructions issued well after a barge loading accident.
