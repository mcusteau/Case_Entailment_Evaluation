  The applicant seeks to have this judicial review application converted to an action on various grounds which include: (1) that the affidavit evidence is polarized and that a proper determination consideration can only be made by an assessment of each piece of evidence based on viva voce testimony; (2) that all of the evidence is, by its nature, such that it depends upon findings of credibility, which in turn requires the witnesses to appear in person. so that the court may assess their demeanour and credibility; (3) that the facts are sensitive by reason of the small and remote nature of the community, the history and culture of the community and the roles of individual members of the community and how their relationships intertwine, the assessment of which, as to relevance and weight, cannot adequately be established by affidavit evidence; (4) that since the Court Order of 14 February 2003, staying her banishment, the applicant, having returned to Klemtu, has been subject to harassment, including being prevented both from working and from visiting the community school; (5) that her family has been approached in an unfair manner by local officials; (6) that the affidavit evidence does not address the ongoing nature of the effects of the Band Council Resolution; and (7) that these issues, which are of importance to the aboriginal community of Klemtu, are particularly difficult to assess in affidavit form, because oral traditions have been recognised as a generally preferred manner in which to collect and compile evidence for legal proceedings. Counsel for the applicant, as a result of all of this, submits that affidavit evidence is inadequate to fully inform the Court.
