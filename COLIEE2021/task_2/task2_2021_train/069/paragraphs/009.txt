  Counsel for the respondents questions the need for viva voce evidence to explain to the judge the organization of aboriginal communities, relying upon the decision of Mr. Justice Lemieux in  
 Misquadis v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [2000] F.T.R. Uned. 421; [2000] F.C.J. No. 1488 (T.D.), at issue being the delivery of educational and training services to urban aboriginal communities. In  
 Misquadis 
  the applicants wished to have oral testimony not only to resolve contradictions in the affidavits, but also on the basis that "the nature of aboriginal communities are oral societies and that the history and politics of aboriginal communities is not found in books or in written materials but passed on through oral tradition." (paragraph 11). This submission was rejected for the Court not only felt that conflicting affidavit evidence was not a special circumstance, but also that oral testimony was not needed "... to explain how urban aboriginal communities are organized today and how they make decisions." (paragraph 15). However Mr. Justice Lemieux went on to grant the applicant leave to file further affidavit evidence on how urban aboriginal communities functioned in Winnipeg, Toronto and Niagara Falls. This case is helpful, but not particularly on point, for at issue is not the way in which the community of Klemtu is structured, but rather the basis for the allegedly unfair approach taken in promulgating the Band Council Resolution. However, Mr. Justice Lemieux also had to consider whether oral evidence was necessary in order to explain interrelationships in the communities.
