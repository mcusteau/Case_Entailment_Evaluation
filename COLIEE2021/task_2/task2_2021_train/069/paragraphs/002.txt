  The grounds for the application for judicial review are, to paraphrase: 
 
 
 
 (i) an arrest at Klemtu, by or on the instruction of the Kitasoo-Xaixais Police Board on 22 November 2002, the day after the Band Council banishment Resolution was issued and an immediate removal from Klemtu; 
 
 
 
 (ii) the Band Council acted without jurisdiction and beyond its jurisdiction, or refuse to exercise its jurisdiction; 
 
 
 
 (iii) the Band Council failed to observe the principle of natural justice by issuing the Band Council Resolution without notice, without disclosure of the case against the applicant and without affording the applicant an opportunity to respond; and 
 
 
 
 (iv) the Band Council erred in law by finding, in their Resolution, that the applicant had committed an indictable offence, whereas the applicant was merely charged, a matter not yet having gone to trial, thus being presumed guilty.
