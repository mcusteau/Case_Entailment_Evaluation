  In the present instance at issue is a Band Council Resolution of 21 November 2002: 
 
 
 
 "WHEREAS due to the actions of Margaret Edgar as brought before the Kitasoo Band Council by the Kitasoo-Xaixais Police Board. 
 
 
 
 "WHEREAS on the 9th day of September, 2002 you did traffic marihuana to an undercover police officer, an indictable offence under the  
 Controlled Drug and Substances Act 
 . 
 
 
 
 "WHEREAS as a result of your actions and upon the recommendation of the Kitasoo-Xaixais Police Board you are hereby banished from the village of Klemtu and prohibited from returning to the village of Klemtu for any reason. 
 
 
 
 "WHEREAS if you enter the village of Klemtu in violation of this Band Council Resolution you are subject to arrest and charges as a trespasser. 
 
 
 
 "THAT this Band Council Resolution will be subject to review by the Kitasoo Band Council in October 2004." 
 
 
 
 At issue is whether the making of this Resolution, in camera, both without notice to and without the participation of Ms. Edgar, either breached the principle of natural justice or infringed upon her liberty and security of the person in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice as provided for in s. 7 of the  
 Charter
