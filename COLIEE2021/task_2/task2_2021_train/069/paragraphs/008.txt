  Counsel for the applicant submits that there are a multitude of complex and sensitive issues which relate to historically and culturally specific relationships in the small community of Klemtu which cannot be adequately considered and assessed without viva voce evidence. Counsel goes on to point out that it is well-established legal and anthropological knowledge that the preferred method of communication of evidence, for many aboriginal peoples, is oral testimony. Counsel feels that the irrelevant animosities were involved in making the decision and that the involved ought to give their evidence in a trial setting, subject to cross-examination, thus allowing the judge to view the demeanour, substance and credibility of the witnesses.
