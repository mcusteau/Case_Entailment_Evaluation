  In that a consideration of s. 18.4(2) is, by  
 Drapeau 
 , supra, open-ended so far as factors are concerned, I have also thought about the effect that full discovery of documents, proper examination for discovery and the likelihood of eventual and thorough cross-examination before a judge might have on settlement. This is a proceeding which given the views of Mr. Justice Lemieux, ought to be settled by the parties. Mr. Justice Lemieux was particularly scathing, in commenting upon the banishment Resolution, in his reasons of 13 February 2003, following which he granted an injunction staying the banishment Resolution: 
 
 
 
 "[30] ... The applicant in my view has a very strong case that a breach of fairness invalidates the Resolution. She was banned from her community without being able to address the decision-maker (the Band Council). One simply has to refer to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Nicholson v. Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Police Commissioners 
 , [1979] 1 S.C.R. 311 and  
 Martineau v. Matsqui Institution 
 , [1980] 1 S.C.R. 602." 
 
 
 
 The two Supreme Court of Canada cases to which Mr. Justice Lemieux refers make reference to a well-known passage from  
 Furnell v. Whangarei High Schools Board 
 , [1973] A.C. 660 (P.C.), at 679: 
 
 
 
 "Natural justice is but fairness writ large and juridically. It has been described as 'fair play in action'. Nor is it a leaven to be associated only with judicial or quasi-judicial occasions. But as was pointed out by Tucker, L.J., in  
 Russell v. Duke of Norfolk 
 , [1949] 1 All E.R. 109, 118, the requirements of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of each particular case and the subject matter under consideration."
