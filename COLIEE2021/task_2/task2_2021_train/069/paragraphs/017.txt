  In rejecting the submissions of counsel for Ms. Edgar as to need to oral testimony, in a trial setting, in order to deal with voice to the evidence of underlying animosities and ongoing discrimination, I am aware of the importance of flexible rules of procedure and evidence, such as those referred to by Mr. Justice Gibson in  
 Kingfisher v. Canada 
  (2001), 209 F.T.R.R 211; 2001 FCT 858 (T.D.). Oral history related to historical matters, may be required where there is insufficient documentary evidence to provide the aboriginal perspective on rights claimed, in order to promote truth finding and fairness: see  
 Kingfisher 
  at paragraphs 51 through 58. However, in the present instance, I am not convinced that affidavit evidence, augmented as I have ordered, will be inadequate.
