  This is because, in contrast to the present tense focus of the first of the two tests set forth in section 4 of the Regulations, which requires an assessment of whether the impugned marriage " 
 is 
  not genuine," the focus of the second of those tests requires an assessment of whether the marriage " 
 was 
  entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act" (emphasis added). Accordingly, in assessing whether the latter test is satisfied, the focus must be upon the intentions of both parties to the marriage at the time of the marriage. I agree with the Respondent that testimony by those parties regarding what they were thinking at that time typically will be the most probative evidence regarding their primary purpose for entering into the marriage.
