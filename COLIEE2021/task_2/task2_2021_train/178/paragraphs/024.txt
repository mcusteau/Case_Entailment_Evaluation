  Turning to Mr. Gill's interview with the visa officer, the IAD noted that he had made a number of statements which supported the Minister's contention that the primary purpose of the marriage was to gain status or privilege under the IRPA. For example, he stated that he had to separate from his first wife because their marriage could not be registered (due to the fact that she was still legally married to someone else when he married her), and therefore "my marriage was not acceptable for my case." In addition, he stated that, while he wanted to return to India to marry someone of his parents' choice, he was "temporary in Canada and needed to become permanent here." He also appeared to acknowledge that he was searching for a bride who could sponsor him.
