 [27] 
  This Court's ruling in  
 Tamber v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2008 FC 951 is distinguishable, because the IAD's above-described conclusion was based on more than just a finding that the spouse was highly motivated to immigrate to Canada 
 . Owusu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 1195, at para 16 is also distinguishable, because the IAD's above-described conclusion was not primarily based on attitudes derived from our culture.
