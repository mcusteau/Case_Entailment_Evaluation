  In my view, it was not unreasonable for the IAD to conclude, for the reasons described above, that at the time Mr. Gill entered the marriage, he did so primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the IRPA. In reaching that conclusion, the IAD did not err by failing to explicitly discuss evidence about matters that post-dated the marriage. That said, I note that such evidence was appropriately considered by the IAD in reaching its conclusion regarding the genuineness of the marriage.
