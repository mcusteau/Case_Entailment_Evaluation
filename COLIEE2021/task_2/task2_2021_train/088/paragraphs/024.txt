  Ms. Chertyuk submits that the Officer erred by applying the wrong test for determining the genuineness of her marriage. Ms. Chertyuk says that she and Mr. Shishmanov fall within the parameters of section 124 of the Regulations. The Minister, on the other hand, submits that the Officer applied the proper test. According to the Minister, the reasons of the Officer demonstrate that she rightly "turned her mind to whether the marriage was genuine or whether it was entered into for immigration purposes." The respective positions of the parties on this point are considered below.
