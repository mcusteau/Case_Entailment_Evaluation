  Ms. Chertyuk further submits that the Officer's decision to refuse her application for permanent residence is unreasonable. According to Ms. Chertyuk, the "sole basis" for the Officer's conclusion that her marriage was not genuine was Mr. Shishmanov's successful claim for refugee protection on the basis of his homosexuality. Ms. Chertyuk says that the Officer failed to consider the evidence that her relationship with Mr. Shishmanov developed over time and that Mr. Shishmanov no longer identifies as being homosexual. The Minister takes the opposite view, arguing that the decision of the Officer is reasonable and supported by the evidence of Mr. Shishmanov's stated sexual orientation and the timing of Ms. Chertyuk's status in Canada.
