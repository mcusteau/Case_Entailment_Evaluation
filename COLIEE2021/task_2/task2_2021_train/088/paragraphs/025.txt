  Ms. Chertyuk argues that she meets the definition of spouse in subsection 124(a) of the Regulations. Ms. Chertyuk also contends that, in accordance with the decision in  
 Horbas v. Canada (MEI) and Secretary of State for External Affairs 
 , [1985] 2 F.C. 359, 22 D.L.R. (4th) 600 (T.D.), she did not enter the marriage "primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada" because she had already entered Canada as a visitor and met Mr. Shishmanov by "happenstance." The Minister counters, arguing that sections 4 and 124 of the Regulations must be read together and that, contrary to the position of Ms. Chertyuk, the relevant question before the Officer was whether she entered the marriage "primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act." In my view, the argument of Ms. Chertyuk is not persuasive.
