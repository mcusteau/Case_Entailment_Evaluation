  Mr. Shishmanov's sexual orientation was not, as Ms. Chertyuk suggests, the sole basis for the Officer's decision. The Officer was also concerned that the relationship "coincide[d] with the timing when [Ms. Chertyuk] had been refused an extension of her visitor status in Canada." As to the claim that the Officer failed to consider the evidence that the relationship developed over time and that Mr. Shishmanov no longer identified as being homosexual, it is important to note that this evidence was in fact considered by the Officer and found to be incredible. The Officer did not believe that Mr. Shishmanov's sexual orientation would suddenly change after his encounter with Ms. Chertyuk. When that negative credibility finding is considered in light of Mr. Shishmanov's own evidence that he was involved in homosexual relationships throughout his adult life and not bisexual, it cannot be said that the Officer's decision is unsupported by the evidence or falls outside the range of acceptable outcomes that are defensible in fact and in law. While Ms. Chertyuk may disagree with the decision of the Officer, the decision cannot be said to be unreasonable.
