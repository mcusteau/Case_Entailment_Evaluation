 [27] 
  To the extent that Ms. Chertyuk argues that she has satisfied the test set forth in  
 Horbas 
 , having not married "primarily for the purpose of gaining admission to Canada" because she had already entered Canada as a visitor, it is important to note that  
 Horbas 
  was decided under subsection 4(3) of the former  
 Immigration Regulations, 1978 
 , SOR/78-172. That provision has since been replaced by section 4 of the Regulations, which now insists that a marriage not be entered into "primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act." That was the legal element Ms. Chertyuk was required to satisfy.
