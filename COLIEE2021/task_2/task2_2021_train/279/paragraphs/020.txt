Paul Aterman's affidavits describe the purpose of these guidelines from the Board's perspective. He says that they are issued to address specific legal issues, to provide guidance on questions of mixed law and fact, to codify the exercise of discretion, and to provide guidance on procedural issues. The intent is to promote consistency, coherence and fairness in the treatment of cases at the Board. They are not viewed as binding. Members are advised to use their discretion to follow a different approach where warranted in individual cases. These views are also set out in a statement entitled "Policy on the use of the Chairperson's Guidelines" attached as Exhibit "J" to the second Aterman affidavit.
