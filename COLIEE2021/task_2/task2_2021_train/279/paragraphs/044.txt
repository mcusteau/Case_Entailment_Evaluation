However, as noted by Justice Blanchard in
Thamotharem
at paragraph 15, a pragmatic and functional analysis is not required when the Court is assessing allegations of the denial of natural justice or procedural fairness:
Canadian Union of Public Employees et al. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour)
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539; 304 N.R. 76; 173 O.A.C. 38; 2003 SCC 29. Instead, the Court must examine the specific circumstances of the case and determine whether the tribunal in question observed the duty of fairness. If the Court concludes that there has been a breach of natural justice or procedural fairness, no deference is due and the Court will set aside the decision of the Board.
