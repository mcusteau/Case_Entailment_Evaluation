Paragraph 23 of the Guideline provides that the RPD member may change the order of questioning in exceptional circumstances. The examples provided of exceptional circumstances are a severely disturbed claimant or a very young child who might feel intimidated by an unfamiliar examiner and thereby finds it difficult to understand and answer questions. In such circumstances, the paragraph says, the member could decide that it would be better for the claimant's counsel to begin the questioning. However, the party who believes that exceptional circumstances exist is expected to make an application to change the order of questioning before the hearing and the application is to be made according to the RPD Rules s. 44, that is, in writing before the hearing supported by evidence in affidavit or statutory declaration form.
