[194]
At paragraph 44 of his reasons, Justice Gonthier referred to the well-established test for institutional impartiality put forward by Justice de Grandpr√© in
Committee for Justice and Liberty Foundation et al. v. National Energy Board et al.
, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369; 9 N.R. 115, at 394 [S.C.R.]. Justice Gonthier summarized the test in these words:
"... The determination of institutional bias presupposes that a well-informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically -- and having thought the matter through -- would have a reasonable apprehension of bias in a substantial number of cases. In this regard, all factors must be considered, but the guarantees provided for in the legislation to counter the prejudicial effects of certain institutional characteristics must be given special attention."
