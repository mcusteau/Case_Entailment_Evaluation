In
ZÃ¼ndel v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.
(2000), 264 N.R. 174; 195 D.L.R.(4th) 399 (F.C.A.) (
Zundel
), the Court of Appeal considered the question of whether the doctrine of waiver may be relied upon in the face of a finding of reasonable apprehension of bias. The appellant had cited
Newfoundland Telephone Co. v. Board of Commissioners of Public Utilities (Nfld.)
, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 623; 134 N.R. 241; 95 Nfld. & P.E.I.R. 271; 301 A.P.R. 271; 89 D.L.R.(4th) 289 (
Newfoundland Telephone
), for the proposition that a finding of bias rendered the hearing void, leaving no room for waiver to operate.
Newfoundland Telephone
, however, did not address the question of waiver and the objection to the proceedings was raised at the very outset.
