The role of RPD members under
IRPA
is described in the Guideline as comparable to that of Commissioners under the
Inquiries Act
, R.S.1985, c. I-11. The text states that members may inquire into anything they consider relevant to establishing whether a claim is well-founded and define the issues that must be resolved in order to render a decision. This role is distinguished in the Guideline from that of a judge. A judge's role, the Guideline states, is to consider the evidence and argument which the parties chose to present. Moreover, it provides, the RPD has control of its own procedure, including who is to start the questioning. RPD members, the text states, have to be actively involved to make the RPD's inquiry process work properly.
