At paragraph 30 of the second affidavit, Mr. Aterman states that prior to the issuance of Guideline 7, the order of questioning at RPD hearings varied regionally within the IRB. Guideline 7 introduced a national standard order of questioning. His affidavit further describes the consultations that were undertaken with interested non-governmental organizations prior to the implementation of the guideline which resulted in steps being taken by the Board to respond to concerns raised. These included internal training sessions on questioning and a six month phase-in period from December 1, 2003 to May 31, 2004 during which the standard order was implemented only with the claimant's consent.
