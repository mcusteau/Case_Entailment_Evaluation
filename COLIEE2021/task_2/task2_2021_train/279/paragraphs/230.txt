In
Marshall v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 46; 2004 FC 34; [2004] F.C.J. No. 73, the Court stated at paragraph 2:
"The applicant at the hearing raised the issue of reasonable apprehension of bias by the presiding member. However this issue was not raised in the applicant's original pleadings, but only in a further Memorandum of Argument on behalf of the Applicant filed subsequently to receiving the Minister's Memorandum of Argument. Given that Rule 301(e) requires a complete and concise statement of the grounds intended to be argued,
I believe it is too late at this stage as it was not part of the original application. In any event if there was such an issue, it should have been raised by motion before the presiding member and not now on judicial review.
