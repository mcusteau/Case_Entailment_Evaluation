The application of these factors to the Guideline 7 order of questioning procedure was analysed in depth by Justice Blanchard in
Thamotharem
at paragraphs 68-83 of his reasons. He concluded that an application of the first, second and third factors indicated that a higher level of procedural fairness was called for. His analysis of the fourth factor dealing with legitimate expectation and the fifth concerning the ability of the tribunal to control its own process pointed to a lesser standard. With regard to the importance of the decision to the individual affected, the third factor, I agree with Justice Blanchard that as the security interests of the claimants are engaged and will be determined by the Board's decision, this indicates that a higher degree of procedural fairness is required.
