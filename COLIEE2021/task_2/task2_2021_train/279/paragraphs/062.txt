I recognize that the language of court procedures has crept into the practice of the IRB. Counsel and, indeed, Board members in their decisions speak of "examination-in-chief" and "cross-examination" and describe the procedure mandated by Guideline 7 as a "reverse order" of questioning. But the nature of the hearings before the RPD is meant to be administrative and non-adversarial, as is reflected in the language of s. 162(2) and s. 170 of the statute. If Parliament had intended that these hearings employ court procedures it could easily have said so. The legislative intent is to the contrary.
