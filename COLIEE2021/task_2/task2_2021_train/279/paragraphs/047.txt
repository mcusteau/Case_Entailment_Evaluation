There is no dispute between the parties that s. 7 of the
Charter
is engaged in the refugee determination process as that question was determined by the Supreme Court in
Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177; 58 N.R. 1; 17 D.L.R.(4th) 422 (
Singh
). The respondent takes the position, however, that there is no need for the Court to determine this matter on fundamental justice considerations as this case may be resolved through the application of administrative law principles respecting natural justice.
