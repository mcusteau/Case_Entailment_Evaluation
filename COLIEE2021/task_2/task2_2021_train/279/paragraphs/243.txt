[243]
Based on the questions proposed for certification by the applicants and the respondent's reply, I would certify the following questions which I believe pass the test articulated by the Court of Appeal in
Liyanagamage v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1637; 176 N.R. 4 (F.C.A.):
1. Does Guideline 7, issued under the authority of the Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board, violate the principles of fundamental justice under s. 7 of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms
by unduly interfering with claimants' right to be heard and right to counsel?
2. Does the implementation of paragraphs 19 and 23 of the Chairperson's Guideline 7 violate principles of natural justice?
3. Has the implementation of Guideline 7 led to fettering of Refugee Protection Division Members' discretion?
4. Does a finding that Guideline 7 fetters a Refugee Protection Division Member's discretion necessarily mean that the application for judicial review must be granted, without regard to whether or not the applicant was otherwise afforded procedural fairness in the particular case or whether there was an alternate basis for rejecting the claim?
5. Does the role of Refugee Protection Division Members in questioning refugee claimants, as contemplated by Guideline 7, give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias?
6. Is Guideline 7 unlawful because it is ultra vires the guideline-making authority of the Chairperson under paragraph 159(1)(h) of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
?
7. When must an applicant raise an objection to Guideline 7 in order to be able to raise it upon judicial review?
All of these questions, in my view, transcend the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation, raise issues of broad significance and could be determinative of the appeal.
Order accordingly.
