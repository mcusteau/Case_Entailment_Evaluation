There is no evidence before me as to the practice of other administrative tribunals and I am not prepared to speculate as to what their practices might be based on my own knowledge or counsel's submissions. In so far as the proceedings before the other IRB Divisions are concerned, the only material that I have indicates that they are in fact adversarial and involve parties with opposing interests. Thus, I would have difficulty finding that they are suitable comparators for the purpose of a s. 15 analysis.
