The applicant's work record and his letter of reference do not show that he was involved in the design or development of machinery, vessels or systems. The applicant's own affidavit sets out how he described his work experience to the visa officer:
"During my interview, I told the Visa Officer that when I worked with the White Sea & Omega Shipping Company (Belomorski-Onezhskoe Parokhodstvo) from November 1993 to July 1996, I worked aboard ship and on shore. I supervised the installation and repair of power plants, propulsion systems and other machinery on the ships of my employer."
