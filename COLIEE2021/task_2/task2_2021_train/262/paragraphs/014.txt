Counsel for the respondent referred me to the jurisprudence that has stated that an informal or preliminary assessment by a visa officer does not constitute an assessment of the applicant and that a visa officer has a duty to carry out an assessment of an applicant in the person's intended occupation; see, for example
Issaeva v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 124 F.T.R. 178; 37 Imm. L.R.(2d) 91 (T.D.), and
Birioulin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 163 F.T.R. 279 (T.D.). I do not understand this jurisprudence to require a visa officer to continue an assessment in a given occupational category after it has become clear that the applicant cannot obtain the required number of points to be granted landing. For example, if there is a requirement that at least one point be awarded under a given factor, and the visa officer determines that the particular individual will be awarded zero under that factor, the visa officer is not required to continue a pointless exercise of evaluating the other factors. An assessment has been done.
