I turn then to the argument that the visa officer relied upon extrinsic evidence. As noted, during the interview, one of the statements made by the applicant was that his work log had been improperly translated. The visa officer is fluent in Russian and examined the applicant's original documents. She stated that she would have expected them to say "inginier" if the applicant was in fact an engineer. After the interview, the visa officer consulted the
Oxford Russian-English Dictionary
(1993), which confirmed that "mekhanik" means mechanic. The applicant asserts that in doing so the visa officer took into account extrinsic evidence, and this constitutes a breach of natural justice. The applicant included in his application record an excerpt from a Russian-English dictionary (Russky Yazyk, Moscow, 1992), which appears to equate the word "mekhanik" with mechanical engineer, although it is difficult to be certain since the explanatory notes that accompany the definitions are written in Russian.
