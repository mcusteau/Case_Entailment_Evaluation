  Subsection 220(3.1) of the Act gives the Minister discretionary authority to waive or cancel all or any part of a penalty or interest otherwise payable under the Act by a taxpayer or a partnership. According to the  
 Guidelines for the Cancellation or Waiver of Penalties and Interest 
 , as a general rule, the Minister will grant relief where the default giving rise to the penalty or interest in question is due to: extraordinary circumstances beyond the applicant's control; actions of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA); or inability to pay or financial hardship. The Minister may also grant relief if a taxpayer's circumstances do not fall within the previously stated situations. (Information Circular IC07-I,  
 Taxpayer Relief Provisions 
 , May 31, 2007, paragraphs 23, 24).
