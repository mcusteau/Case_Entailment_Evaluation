  Furthermore, the applicant submits that the Minister failed to take account of all the evidence in his file. While the May 8, 2008 decision explicitly states that all documentation provided was reviewed, extraordinary circumstances should have been sustained with supporting documentation provided by the applicant, as required by the guidelines. (Information Circular IC07-I,  
 Taxpayer Relief Provisions 
 , May 31, 2007, paragraph 32 (g)). Thus, no documentation sustains the applicant's allege financial hardship. Without evidence to that effect, the Minister has no obligation to further enquire on the inability to pay of the applicant. Also, the Report on a Fairness Request dated May 22, 2008 submitted as Exhibit A to Mr. Gilles Lavergne's affidavit further details the analysis of the applicant's submissions in whole. I fail to see any reviewable error that would affect the result in this case.
