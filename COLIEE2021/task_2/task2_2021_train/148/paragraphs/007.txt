  When the CRA issues a decision not to grant the taxpayer the relief requested, the Act provides that the taxpayer can request a second level of review to be performed by the CRA. This second level of review is made by the Director of the relevant district office or taxation centre. In the event that taxpayer relief is refused as a result of a second level of review, then an unsatisfied applicant may apply to the Federal Court for judicial review of the taxpayer relief decision made by the CRA.
