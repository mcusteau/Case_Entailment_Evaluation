  The applicant raises several arguments justifying a review of the May 8, 2008 decision. Firstly, the applicant submits that the lack of reasoning of the November 29, 2007 decision prevented it from addressing in its second level review application those specific reasons the Minister was to have set out for its denial of full relief. Reasons were provided to the applicant justifying the partial relief, the whole in accordance with the guidelines (Information Circular IC07-I,  
 Taxpayer Relief Provisions 
 , May 31, 2007, paragraph 11). Thus, by specifically stating "the sickness of Mrs. Charlotte Fineberg and Dr. Irwin Fineberg" as grounds for its partial relief, the Minister properly used of its discretion and rejected all other justifications submitted by the applicant. Accordingly, the applicant further emphasized third-party delay as grounds for relief in its second level review application. Moreover, the Minister also rejected said justification. Thus, this Court has steadily refused to accept that a taxpayer's relief application be validly based on the fault of the third party ( 
 Légaré v. Canada Customs and Revenue Agency 
 , [2004] 5 C.T.C. 44, 2003 FC 1047 at paragraph 10;  
 Tadross v. Canada (Minister of National Revenue) 
 , [2005] 1 C.T.C. 201, 2004 FC 1698 at paragraphs 10-11;  
 Babin v. Canada (Canada Customs and Revenue Agency) 
 , [2005] 4 C.T.C. 1, 2005 FC 972 at paragraph 12). It is the essence of our tax collection system that taxpayers are sole responsible for self-assessment and self-reporting to the CRA. Thus, it was open to the Minister to conclude that the applicant had been negligent in the conduct of its tax affairs in waiting for more than eight years for a notice from its accountant to ultimately remedy to its failure to comply with its tax reporting obligations.
