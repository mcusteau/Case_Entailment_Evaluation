  The plaintiff sought to rely on the wording of the Minister's "single species" and "fleet separation" policies to demonstrate that restricting him from utilizing an inshore and offshore licence at the same time was not consistent with those policies. These policies are included in the Commercial Fisheries Licensing Policy for Eastern Canada issued by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. It is not necessary to analyze the policies in detail. As defendant's counsel pointed out, they are policies, not law, and to elevate them to the level of law would fetter the Minister in the exercise of his discretion under section 7. In  
 Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Canada and Minister of Economic Development 
 , [1982] 2 S.C.R. 2; 44 N.R. 354, McIntyre, J., stated at pages 6-7 [S.C.R.]: 
 
 
 
 "The discretion is given by the Statute and the formulation and adoption of general policy guidelines cannot confine it. There is nothing improper or unlawful for the Minister charged with responsibility for the administration of the general scheme provided for in the  
 Act 
  and  
 Regulations 
  to formulate and to state general requirements for the granting of import permits. It will be helpful to applicants for permits to know in general terms what the policy and practice of the Minister will be. To give the guidelines the effect contended for by the appellant would be to elevate ministerial directions to the level of law and fetter the Minister in the exercise of his discretion." 
 
 
 
 The Commercial Fisheries Licensing Policy for Eastern Canada may assist fishermen to know, in general terms, the policies of the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in respect of licensing. However, the Policy cannot fetter the Minister's discretion under section 7.
