  In 1995, the plaintiff obtained an offshore licence for turbot in divisions 2GH&J for a vessel of 65 feet or over. Prior to obtaining this licence, he had obtained an inshore licence for a vessel under 65 feet. Six days after the offshore licence was issued, Jim Baird, Chief of Resource Allocation and Licensing for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans in St. John's, wrote to the plaintiff advising him that while he was utilizing a vessel in the 65 foot or over category for turbot, his groundfish licence for a vessel under 65 feet could not be utilized at the same time. Nonetheless, the plaintiff continued to fish utilizing both licences and vessels in 1995.
