  The policy of the

  and the considerations that are relevant to the exercise of the Minister's discretion under section 7 of the  
 Act 
  are those set forth by Major, J., in  
 Comeau 
  above. Specifically, under the  
 Fisheries Act 
 , it is the duty of the Minister to manage the fisheries. Licensing to restrict entry into the commercial fishery and to limit the number of fishermen and vessels is an instrument or device available to the Minister to carry out such management.
