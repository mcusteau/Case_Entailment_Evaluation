  In any event, I am satisfied from the evidence that the Minister, in refusing to allow the utilization of both inshore and offshore licences at the same time by the plaintiff, was not exercising his discretion contrary to the single species or fleet separation policies as they have been interpreted in the past and as they are understood by those in the industry. Indeed, the evidence is that for Newfoundland, there are some 8,000 inshore licences and only about 15 offshore licences, that inshore licences are issued only to owner-operators and that no licensees (other than the plaintiff) hold both inshore and offshore licences.
