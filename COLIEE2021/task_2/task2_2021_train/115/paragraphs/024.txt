 [24] 
  The plaintiff's alternative argument is based on negligent misrepresentation. There are numerous problems with this cause of action. The plaintiff has not demonstrated a duty of care based on a special relationship between the Minister and the plaintiff. Nor has he shown that the Minister acted negligently in making the representation or that he relied to his detriment on anything the Minister said, in press releases, contracts, or in any other manner. The plaintiff simply wants the Minister to be bound to permit him to utilize both inshore and offshore licences at the same time because at some time in the past, in conjunction with the offshore developmental program, the Minister allowed this to occur. However, as indicated, the elements necessary to prove negligent misrepresentation are not present. In oral argument, plaintiff's counsel sought to characterize the cause of action as one of estoppel. Even if it is characterized in that manner, there is still no evidence of reliance by the plaintiff to his detriment on anything said or done by the Minister.
