  The plaintiff has been a fisherman all his working life. He has fished under inshore fishing licences (registered vessels up to 65 feet in length) and under offshore fishing licences (registered vessels of 65 feet or more in length). In the late 1980's and early 1990's, the plaintiff was issued inshore fishing licences and had utilized them with vessels under 65 feet in length. He fished for northern cod and crab, but due to a scarcity of fish, the cod fishery closed.
