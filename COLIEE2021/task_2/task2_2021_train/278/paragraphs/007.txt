"1. THAT I am owner of a retail tobacconist known as Jade's Smokers Corner doing business in the Eaton-Dominion Mall in the City of Regina.
"2. THAT Jade's Smokers Corner was until May 13th, 1981, known as the 'Smoke Shoppe'.
"3. THAT I have held my aforesaid position with Jade's Smokers Corner and the Smoke Shoppe since May, 1979.
