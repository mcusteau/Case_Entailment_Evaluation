Counsel for the appellant contends that evidence of sales after the date of the notice on July 13, 1980, was totally irrelevant. There are only passing references in the affidavits of Roland Bouchard and Dean Smith to the sale of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes after July 30, 1980 and the affidavit averments, as I see them, are primarily directed to the single sale occurring before that date in the context of its overall commercial attributes. It is now settled that the question whether a trademark is in use in Canada within the meaning of s. 44(1) must be decided upon the interpretation of its relevant statutory provisions, one of which is that evidence of use is not limited to use immediately prior to the notice date.
