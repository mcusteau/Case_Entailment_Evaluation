The appellant contends that the affidavit evidence of the respondent is defective in several respects with the result that the respondent failed to meet the onus of establishing on balance of probability that the trademark CAMBRIDGE was in use in Canada. Firstly, it is submitted that there is no evidence that the Smoke Shoppe ever ordered the four cartons of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes. In other words, there was no specific order for four cartons of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes from the retail shop to the owner of the trademark, Imperial Tobacco, and delivery by the latter pursuant to such order, thereby constituting a completed contract. This appears to have been the view of a normal commercial transaction taken by Gibson, J., in Molson Companies Ltd. v. Halter (1977), 28 C.P.R.(2d) 158. The decision in that case seems to have turned on the fact that the affidavit evidence of use in Canada was seen as unreliable. In my view, subsequent authorities have extended the meaning of the words "normal course of trade" in s. 4 of the Act beyond the narrow parameters of the Molson case.
