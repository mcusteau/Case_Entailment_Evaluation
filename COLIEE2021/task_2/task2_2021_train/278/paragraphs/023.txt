In my view the present case is distinguishable from Sim & McBurney in several important respects. As previously indicated, there was nothing in the supporting affidavit in Sim & McBurney to link the sales to normal course of trade transactions. In contrast, the first Bouchard affidavit deposes in paragraph 5 that Imperial Tobacco had continuously sold CAMBRIDGE cigarettes in Canada since December 31, 1971 "in the usual course of its business and trade". The case of Sim & McBurney, like Plough, is further distinguishable by the fact that the affidavit in response to the s. 44 notice makes nothing more than the bare statement that the trademark was in use in Canada and fails to show the facts establishing such use. Small wonder that such evidence was held to be inadequate. In contrast, the affidavit evidence in the case at bar, as I have found, adequately establishes a sale in the normal course of trade within the meaning of the statute.
