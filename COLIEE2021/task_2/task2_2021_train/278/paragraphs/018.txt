Counsel for the appellant also objects that the first affidavit of Mr. Bouchard is inadmissible by reason that the evidence of the Smoke Shoppe sale in Regina must be taken to have been based on hearsay, rather than firsthand knowledge. Counsel submits that this inference must be drawn from the fact that Mr. Bouchard resides in Montreal. How could the deponent relate the circumstances of a sale that took place in Regina, except on the basis of secondhand knowledge? Given that the first Bouchard affidavit may not present itself, at first sight, as an affidavit of belief, counsel contends that it must nevertheless be regarded as not being "confined to such facts as the witness is able of his own knowledge to prove" within the meaning of rule 332(1). Counsel for the respondent took the position that a court should not be too quick to dismiss affidavit evidence as hearsay on the mere speculation of counsel that the affidavit was not confined to facts based on firsthand, personal knowledge. He contended in the alternative that any evidentiary gaps in the Bouchard affidavit were outweighed by the Dean Smith affidavit and the evidence in its entirety.
