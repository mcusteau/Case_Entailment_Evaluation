The Bouchard affidavit is not replete with statements made on information and belief nor do the statements therein clearly manifest any flagrant lack of personal knowledge. Under the circumstances and from the fact that the alleged hearsay defect was not raised as a specific ground of appeal, it would be wrong, in my view, to treat the affidavit as being inadmissible. It seems to me on balance that Mr. Bouchard was manifestly in a position from the standpoint of his office and experience with the respondent "to know whereof he deposed": Union Electric Supply Co. Ltd. v. Registrar of Trademarks (1982), 63 C.P.R.(2d) 56, per Mahoney, J., at pp. 59-60. In my opinion, the evidence in its entirety is sufficient to establish the sale of the four cartons of cigarettes to the retail tobacco outlet in Regina.
