In the present case, the affidavit evidence furnished by the registrant is sufficient, in my view, to establish a sale in the normal course of trade. The commercial transaction in this instance involved delivery of the four cartons of CAMBRIDGE cigarettes by the owner to the customer on July 20, 1980 and the concurrent invoicing of the same by the owner to the wholesaler and the wholesaler to the customer. Moreover, the evidence does not indicate that the sale lacked bona fides in the sense of being deliberately manufactured or contrived in an attempt to protect the registration of the trademark rather than to establish its genuine use in the normal course of trade. The appellant's arguments on these points must therefore fail.
