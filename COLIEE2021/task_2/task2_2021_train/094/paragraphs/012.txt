  The standard of review for PRRA decisions has been the subject of a pragmatic and functional analysis in a number of decisions. For the purpose of these reasons, I adopt the conclusions reached in Kim v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2005), 272 F.T.R. 62, 2005 FC 437 [Kim] that the appropriate standard of review for questions of fact is patent unreasonableness, for questions of mixed fact and law, reasonableness, and for questions of law correctness. When a PRRA decision is considered "globally and as a whole," the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness: Figurado v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] 4 F.C.R. 387, 2005 FC 347.
