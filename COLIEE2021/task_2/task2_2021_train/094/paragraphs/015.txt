  The applicant cites Varga v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1280, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1570 (QL) [Varga] in support of the proposition that PRRA officers must consider the best interests of Canadian children whose parents are subject to removal. In Varga, the Court determined that a failure to do so amounted to reviewable error. In reaching this decision, the Court relied on prior decisions which had indicated that in exercising discretion concerning whether to enforce a removal order under s.48 of IRPA, a removals officer must be sensitive to the best interests of Canadian children, although such officials have no obligation to carry out a full H & C examination.
