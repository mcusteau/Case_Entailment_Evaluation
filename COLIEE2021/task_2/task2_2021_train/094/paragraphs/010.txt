 [10] 
  While I accept that there may be circumstances in which the interests of justice require that evidence that was not before the decision-maker be admitted and considered, I do not find that this is such a case. Having closely reviewed the contested evidence and the remainder of the record, I am satisfied the events they describe were within the applicant's knowledge prior to the filing of the February, 2005 PRRA application and do not reflect a change of circumstances that might justify its reception as an exception to the general principle. Accordingly, the evidence will be struck from the record together with the corresponding paragraphs of the applicant's affidavit.
