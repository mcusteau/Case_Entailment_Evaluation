  As stated by Justice Michel M.J. Shore in Sherzady v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2005), 273 F.T.R. 11 at para. 15, 2005 FC 516, there is nothing in the language of the statute or related regulations to suggest that a PRRA officer is meant to consider humanitarian and compassionate factors in the context of a risk inquiry. The risk contemplated by the enactment is that which is personal to the subject of the inquiry.
