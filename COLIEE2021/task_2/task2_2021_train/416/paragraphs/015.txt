The Canada Customs officer serving at the time as primary customs inspector, who was the first customs officer encountered by the plaintiff, was Mrs. Belinder West, a customs officer since 1981. Her task as primary inspection officer was to check passports and customs declarations of persons arriving from outside Canada and to decide whether each should be referred for a secondary examination or should be allowed to go without further examination. She is of East Indian origin or ancestry. She initiated her questioning in English but at one point she asked the plaintiff in Punjabi if she had acquired, received or purchased any jewelry while away. The plaintiff responded in English that the only jewelry acquired was a set of earrings given to her daughter. This was noted on the daughter's card. The plaintiff also said she was conversant in English and preferred to speak English. The officer asked again in English if any jewelry was acquired, purchased or received while away or if the plaintiff had had any jewelry redesigned while away to which the response was "no". Her card was then coded by the officer as having declared no jewelry, and also for a secondary examination for inspection for jewelry. The officer professed to having asked the plaintiff several times whether she understood her questions and to having given every opportunity for the plaintiff to report her jewelry, and that she found the plaintiff responsive to her questions whether in English or Punjabi. The plaintiff had made no request for an interpreter.
