The plaintiff's recollection of the first encounter with a customs officer was that the officer, a woman, was probably of Chinese origin, certainly not an East Indian, who spoke to her only in English and who asked, in relation to jewelry, whether she had received any gold jewelry while in India. To this the plaintiff had replied in English that her daughter, accompanying her, had received gold rings as a gift.
