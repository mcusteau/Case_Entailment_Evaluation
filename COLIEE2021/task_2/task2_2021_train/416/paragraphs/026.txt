It has been determined that the issue of good faith, or lack of intent to mislead, or even inadvertent error, in reporting of goods for Customs purposes is not a ground for holding seizure of goods to be invalid where they have been wrongly reported:
Gervais v. Canada
(1985), 9 C.E.R. 267 (F.C.T.D.);
Lanctôt (Raymond) Ltée v. Canada
(1990), 35 F.T.R. 96; 3 T.C.T. 5244 (F.C.T.D.). In
Gaji et al. v. Canada
(1986), 12 C.E.R. 197, at p. 198 (F.C.T.D.), Mr. Justice Dubé commented:
"An abundant and consistent line of authority has established beyond any question that goods through customs without being declared may be seized, and that the good faith of the person bringing in the goods, or the fact that they are the personal property of that person, is not a factor.
