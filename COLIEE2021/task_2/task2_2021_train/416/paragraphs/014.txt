The plaintiff had presented this officer with completed customs declaration cards of the sort required of all travellers entering Canada for herself and her three children who accompanied her. On these cards it was indicated that she and each of the children had a total value of goods purchased, received or acquired while outside Canada in amounts of $260, $240, $222, $256 in each case, a total of $978 for all four persons. Her evidence at trial was that these cards, printed in English and French, had been completed on the returning aircraft by a man, a stranger, East Indian in origin, who helped her because she did not understand them. She professed she had not advised him what to put on the forms and had not told him how much to claim as goods acquired outside the country. She did admit that her eldest child, a daughter, then some 10 or 11 years of age was educated in and reasonably conversant with English, but she apparently had not relied upon her for assistance in completing the forms.
