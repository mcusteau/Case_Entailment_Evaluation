The case law of this court has clearly established that collection jeopardy orders are justified where there is cogent evidence, objectively viewed, put forward by Revenue Canada, as to the dissipation of a taxpayer's assets or the movement of assets out of the jurisdiction. McNair, J., in
Danielson
, supra, said such evidence would be very persuasive and compelling in establishing, beyond mere suspicion or conjecture, that an action by a taxpayer or a reasonable apprehension of such action would likely jeopardize the Minister's position. (See also

, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1209; 101 F.T.R. 57 (T.D.),

, supra, and
Minshull v. Minister of National Revenue; R. & L. Investments Ltd. v. Minister of National Revenue
(1987), 58 Sask.R. 115; 87 D.T.C. 5385 (Q.B.). In my view, Rouleau, J.'s, decision in
1853-9049 Quebec Inc.
, supra, is to the same effect when he speaks of a collection jeopardy order being available "in short to meet any situation in which a taxpayer's assets may vanish into thin air because of the passage of time".
