[8]
The purpose of s. 225.2(8), under which this proceeding has been taken, is to enable a judge of this court to review the authorization previously given on an ex parte basis. The scope of that review, from which no appeal lies, is set out in s. 225.2(11) which reads:
"225.2(11) On an application under subs. (8), the judge shall determine the question summarily and may confirm, set aside or vary the authorization and make such other order as the judge considers appropriate."
