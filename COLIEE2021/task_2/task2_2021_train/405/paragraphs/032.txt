In addition to the reassessments for taxation years 1995, 1996 and 1997 and, notwithstanding that Services MLM was not required to file its income tax return for financial year 1998 before March 31, 1999, Revenue Canada issued an assessment for taxation year 1998 since the assessment was five times greater than the amounts assessed before and because Wellgate, for the benefit of Services MLM, was to soon receive from Richter and Associates the sum of $2,700,000. For 1998, Revenue Canada assessed Services MLM taxes of $1,147,689.67.
