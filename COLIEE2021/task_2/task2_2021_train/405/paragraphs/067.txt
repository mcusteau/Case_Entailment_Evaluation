In my view, the facts of this case are a classic illustration of the kind of situation contemplated by Parliament for which a jeopardy order would be granted; I say this without the necessity of making any finding or attributing any kind of purpose on the part of Services MLM or Mr. Mareng√®re. This case does not turn on intent or on tax planning; it calls to be determined looking at the matter objectively and realistically on the ground so to speak. In other words, it is the effect or result of the taxpayer's action in dealing with its assets that is important and relevant in the assessment of the appropriateness of a collection jeopardy order. Tax liability is not an issue in such proceedings.
