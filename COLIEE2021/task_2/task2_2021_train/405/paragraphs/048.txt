Revenue Canada counters stating all amounts it calculated as the taxpayer's income were earned by the taxpayer in 1998. Revenue Canada repeats its basic position that Services MLM must report not on a cash basis but on the basis of amounts earned. Specifically, Revenue Canada says the Settlement proceeds were earned during fiscal year 1998 and is to be received in fiscal year 1998. Revenue Canada asserts the same position with respect to the bonus. Revenue Canada adds that Services MLM, for fiscal year 1998, has only made one instalment payment represented by an $8,000 cheque dated April 15, 1999.
