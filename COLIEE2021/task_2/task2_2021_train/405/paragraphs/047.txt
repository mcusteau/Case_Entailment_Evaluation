This was the taxation year in which Revenue Canada issued an assessment notwithstanding that the taxpayer was only obligated to file its returns by March 31, 1999. Revenue Canada assessed income to the taxpayer of $4,121,242 made up of base compensation, bonus and settlement proceeds of $3,693,600 allowing deductible expenses of $200,000. Taxpayer says Revenue Canada has assumed all amounts payable under the Settlement were paid in 1998, that Services MLM was to be the recipient of all amounts and that the amounts represented income to the taxpayer. Services MLM says that none of these assumptions are correct for the following reasons:
(1) The bonus figure is wrong because the Executive under the Services Agreement did not receive 50% of U.S. $210,000 but instead received U.S. $90,000 as a bonus between October 1997 and April 1998.
(2) The base calculation will be reported by the taxpayer or would have been had Revenue Canada afforded the taxpayer the chance to file the return in the normal course.
(3) Relating to reporting income of the Settlement proceeds, Services MLM states these amounts were not reportable before its fiscal year 2000 because the promissory note (the Wellgate note), pursuant to which the proceeds are to be paid, matured in October, 1999. Moreover, a substantial portion of the amounts payable under the Settlement Agreement are payable in respect of damages which are to be received by Michel Mareng√®re personally and are not subject to tax.
