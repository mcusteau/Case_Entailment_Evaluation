The next series of documents relate to proceedings under the
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act
("
BIA
") by Cedar Canada and certain of its Canadian business units. On October 26, 1998, Wellgate, as a secured creditor, petitioned the Quebec Superior Court (Bankruptcy and Insolvency Division) in the matter of Cedar Canada's proposal under the
BIA
. The purpose of this Petition was to allow the sale of the McConnell shares "the most significant asset and value owned by Cedar Canada". Wellgate's Petition was signed by Mr. Mareng√®re as "duly authorized representative of Wellgate International Ltd.". Wellgate's Petition said Wellgate, under the Credit Agreement of April 6, 1998, made available to Cedar Canada a loan in the amount of U.S. $4,800,000 which was secured by a specific charge on the McConnell shares. The Petition also said "the debt due to Petitioner by the Debtor was born as a result of a comprehensive transaction whereby the economic interests of the former management of the Dominion Bridge Group was purchased by investors from the United States of American controlled by Deere Park Equities LLC of Chicago".
