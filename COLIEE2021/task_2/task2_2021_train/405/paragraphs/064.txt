I address a preliminary point and that is the correctness of the assessments. The issue of the correctness of the assessments is one which will be resolved in another forum. Sharlow, J., as she then was, made this clear in
Minister of National Revenue v. MacIver
(1999), 172 F.T.R. 273 (T.D.). My colleague said at paragraph 7 of her reasons for order:
"[7] The tax dispute will be resolved in another forum. It is beyond my jurisdiction to consider whether or not the assessments are correct. For present purposes, I am bound by s. 152(8), which deems the assessments to be valid unless and until they are varied on objection or appeal."
