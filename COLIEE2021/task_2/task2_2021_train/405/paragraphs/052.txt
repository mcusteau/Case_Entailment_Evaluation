The cross-examination of Michel Marengère revealed the circumstances which led to the formation of Wellgate on June 16, 1997. As I appreciate the evidence, Wellgate was the umbrella recommended by U.S. lawyers and accountants under which senior management of the Dominion Bridge Group would inject working capital in Cedar Canada by exercising share options which they held in DBC. This financial participation took place in tandem with the BNY financing already noted. Financing for the purchase of the option came from Deere Park Equities, ("Deere Park") of Chicago, Illinois, through Dominion Park, a limited liability partnership in which Wellgate was partnered with Deere Park. The transaction was a wrap around one with loans made by Deere Park to Dominion Park with the shares of management put up as collateral security for the loans. Michel Marengère participated in Wellgate as did a number of other executives including Nicolas Matossian and Mr. Amyot.
