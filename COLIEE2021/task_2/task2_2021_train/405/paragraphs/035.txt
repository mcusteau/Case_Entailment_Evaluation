Ms. Dazé summarized the grounds upon which Revenue Canada was seeking authority for immediate execution. She outlined two main grounds:
(1) First, Ms. Dazé cites the undeclared income of $1,483,074 for taxation years 1995, 1996 and 1997 and income in the order of $3,941,242 to be declared by Services MLM for fiscal year 1998;
(2) Second, Ms. Dazé mentions the amounts to be received imminently by Wellgate for the benefit of Services MLM. In this connection, Ms. Dazé said that $2,700,000, according to the Settlement Agreement, is payable to Services MLM but pursuant to that agreement, this amount is to be paid to Wellgate, an offshore corporation having no address and having no assets in Canada. Ms. Dazé said that Revenue Canada feared not being able to put its hands on the U.S. $2,700,000 once paid to Wellgate "alors que n'ayant aucune activité, actif ou lieu d'affaires au Canada, vraisemblablement la somme sera transférée aux Îles Vierges, un paradis fiscal et un lieu qui est hors d'atteinte du Ministère".
(3) Ms. Dazé, as a last point, said that Services MLM was already indebted to Revenue Canada in the amount of $21,668 for fiscal year 1997.
