The approach to be followed for the resolution of this matter was stated by Marceau, J.A., in
Minister of National Revenue v. Golbeck et al.
(1990), 90 D.T.C. 6575 (F.C.A.), in the following terms at page 6576:
"It is clear to us that the learned trial judge failed to put his mind to the only question that he had to consider ... . The question was whether, on the basis of the material put before the court, it appeared that the Minister had reasonable grounds for believing that the taxpayer would waste, liquidate or otherwise transfer his assets so as to become less able to pay the amount assessed and thereby jeopardizing the Minister's debt. On an affirmative answer to the question, the judge had no alternative but to grant the application (note the use of the word 'shall' in the provision)."
