I set out, in summary form, the evidence of Services MLM (the "taxpayer") and the response from Revenue Canada. I note here that Services MLM filed Notices of Objections with Revenue Canada on March 29, 1999 to each of the assessment or reassessments issued by Revenue Canada for taxation years 1995 through 1998. The basis for those objections were the following:
"The assessments are incorrect in that they unjustifiably accelerate the receipt of income, fail to take into account that some income was earned by other taxpayers, fail to reduce the gross receipts by consumption taxes and generally charge tax on income which has not been earned by the taxpayer.
"In addition, the assessments treat the taxpayer as a personal services business which is incorrect as the taxpayer was an independant contractor.
"Finally, penalties are levied although these are unjustified as the taxpayer declared all of its income in each of the years.
"The assessments are unfounded in fact and in law and should be cancelled."
