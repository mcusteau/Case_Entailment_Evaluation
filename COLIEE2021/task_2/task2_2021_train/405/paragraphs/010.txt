At the heart of the factual background are three corporate entities: Services M.L. Marengère Inc., a corporation controlled by Mr. Marengère; Wellgate International Inc., a British Virgin Island corporation with head offices there whose Chairman of the Board is Mr. Marengère ("Wellgate") and the Dominion Bridge Group of Companies (the Dominion Bridge Group), formerly the Cedar Group, which has several components including the parent Dominion Bridge Corporation (DBC), a Delaware holding corporation; Cedar Group Canada Inc. (Cedar Canada), a wholly owned subsidiary of DBC and itself a holding company with interests in four separate units: (1) Cedar Group Australia Pty Limited which owned 63.8% of an operating engineering firm known as McConnell Dowell (McConnell), (2) Dominion Bridge Inc., a Canadian operating company ("DBI"); (3) Steen Contractors Ltd. (Steen), a Canadian company with two subsidiaries, namely, Becker Contractors Ltd. and Les Entreprises Becker Inc.; (4) Davie Industries Inc., a shipyard operator in Quebec ("Davie") with a wholly owned subsidiary M.I.L. Intermodal Inc. Also key to the factual background are the terms of a Settlement and Release Agreement signed in April 1998 when the relationship between Mr. Marengère and companies controlled by him and the Dominion Bridge Group terminated.
