Taxpayer challenges Revenue Canada's adding $161,716 as undeclared income for this taxation year. Services MLM says that Revenue Canada's calculations are based on the assumption that it received all of the base compensation under the Services Agreement and that no GST or PST was paid. Taxpayer says it paid $60,318 of GST and PST with the remaining amount reported by the taxpayer's tax return as well as Fidutech who declared $101,176 of income.
