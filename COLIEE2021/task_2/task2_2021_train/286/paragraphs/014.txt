He, once again, wants the record corrected. He denies ever having attempted to escape from the OCRDC in 1992. He was never charged with such attempt and the allegation was never proven. He admits escaping from prison in Iran but says he did so because he was being tortured. Insofar as Warkworth is concerned, he says his planning an escape is a complete fabrication; he was never charged nor was it proven.
