The applicant's complaint of July 30, 1997 was dismissed by CMO Wheeler on October 16, 1997 in these terms:
"This complaint is denied in that there is no foundation to Mr. Tehrankari's request. It is documented that Mr. Tehrankari escaped from Iran, that he attempted during the commission of the indexed offence to evade capture from police, and there is ample reliable preventive security information implicating him in an attempt to escape from Warkworth Institution. Second, the information accusing Mr. Tehrankari of assault is sound. Officer observation reports clearly observe him assaulting ...
Accordingly, no correction can be made because they are not justified or supported by the evidence
." (emphasis mine)
