"I have reviewed your comments as well as those of the Outside Review Committee concerning allegations (ineligible) in your case management files. Your concerns related to the escape information has been discussed with you in an interview with the Security analyst on 98.02.20 (see attached summary). No further action is required. Your grievance is denied on this point. Your grievance related to the assault allegation was investigated. Staff observation reports related the series of events witnessed by them at the time of the incident.
The institutional offence report was dismissed for a technical reason of failure of a witness to appear for court. You provided your explanation of this incident and this has been placed on your file. We are unable to further evaluate your level of involvement in this incident with the information available to us
. No further action." (emphasis mine)
