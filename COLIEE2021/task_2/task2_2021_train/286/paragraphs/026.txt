On April 12, 1998, the Deputy Commissioner for the Ontario Region dismissed the applicant's second level grievance and did so by addressing each of the issues raised by the applicant:
(a) On the point of why the witnessing officers were absent from the institutional disciplinary hearing, the Deputy Commissioner said "[A]n officer's absence from work is information not normally shared. It may be that they were not scheduled to work or they were away for personal reasons".
(b) On the point of providing the O.P.P. with penitentiary officer observation reports, the Deputy Commissioner said "the institutional authorities cooperated with that investigation. Normally cooperation with such an investigation would include providing all pertinent information".
(c) On the point why the observation reports were not presented to the disciplinary hearing, the Deputy Commissioner said "[A]s there were witnesses unable to attend the hearing and the hearing was cut short, there would not have been any opportunity for all information to be presented as would be the case in a full hearing".
(d) The Deputy Commissioner denied the applicant's request for evidence about his alleged planned escape from Warkworth because of section 27(3) of the
Act
, i.e., information may be withheld if the release of that information may jeopardize the safety of any person, the security of the penitentiary or the conduct of a lawful investigation. The Deputy Commissioner also said the information could not be removed from his preventative security file but that his opposition to its inclusion had been noted per section 24 of the
Act
.
