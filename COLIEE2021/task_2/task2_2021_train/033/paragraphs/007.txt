  At the end of 1989, Nor-Equip was in fairly serious financial trouble. In March of 1990, the company obtained a third loan for $500,000 from the FBDB to finance the purchase of equipment. This security agreement contained the same terms concerning patents as the first FBDB security agreement. According to the financial statements as of March 30, 1990, the "patent" was listed as having a value of $4,158.00 and was considered to be an asset of some value to the company.
