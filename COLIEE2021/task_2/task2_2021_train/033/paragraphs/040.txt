 [40] 
  In my opinion, the decision of this Court in  
 Love v. Claveau 
 , supra, is not determinative of this application. In that case, the Court was addressing the issue of whether section 52 is limited to the patent which has been issued or whether it is broad enough to include any entry relating to a pending application for a patent.
