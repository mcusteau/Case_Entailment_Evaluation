  The financial situation did not improve for Nor-Equip. In 1993 the FBDB took steps to collect the monies owed to it. By an agreement dated January 14, 1994, Columbia acquired all of the security agreements, security interests and indebtedness held by the FBDB in respect of Nor-Equip. When Columbia purchased the security agreements from the FBDB, Nor-Equip had been in default for at least four years under its loans to the FBDB. The loans total $1,200,000.00. Acting under the terms of the FBDB security agreements, Columbia began selling the assets of Nor-Equip to third parties. In return for a waiver for the need to present a demand for payment and the requirement for notice to be given of a sale of the collateral under the FBDB security agreements, the FBDB released Mr. DiTullio and his wife from personal guarantees they had given to the FBDB.
