  The Applicant submits that this Court is authorized to look at the various contracts which were made, particularly the contracts by which the FBDB sold its security interests to Columbia Chrome and the subsequent contracts by which Columbia Chrome sold the 469 Patent to the Applicant. The Applicant urges the Court to follow the decisions in  
 Love v. Claveau and Numor Coolant Technologies Ltd. 
 , [1990] 1 F.C. 64; 29 F.T.R. 188 (T.D.) and  
 Saskatchewan Economic Development Corp. v. Westfalia DME Inc. 
  (1993), 46 C.P.R.(3d) 322 (F.C.T.D.). The Applicant submits that the decision in  
 Engineering Dynamics Ltd. v. Joannou 
  (1996), 122 F.T.R. 174 (T.D. Protho.), is not binding because it is a decision of a prothonotary.
