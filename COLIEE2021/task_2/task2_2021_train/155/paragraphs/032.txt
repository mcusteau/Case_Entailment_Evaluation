  With respect to the applicant's personal involvement, the evidence is much less clear. The applicant acknowledged carrying a weapon a few times when acting as a lookout while other militants dynamited utility poles and when he was conducting surveillance of safe houses, but he maintained that he never used it. At most, he used dynamite to blow up utility poles in neighbourhoods in order to trigger demonstrations against the regime, and he made roadside bombs. Based on this evidence, I am not convinced that the officer could reasonably conclude that the applicant himself committed acts of terrorism. Moreover, I note that she did not go into detail on this issue, and the applicant did not spend much time on it either in his written and oral representations. It is true that the applicant attempted to minimize his role at his interview with the immigration officer in March 2012. Although he had told the CSIS officer that he had shot in the direction of a police officer on a mission that went badly, he subsequently denied this, saying that he did not carry weapons except when taking courses to learn how to handle them.
