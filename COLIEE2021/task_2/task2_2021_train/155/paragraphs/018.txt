  The issues raised by the applicant may be summarized as follows: 
 
 
 
 (1) Are the reasons for the decision adequate or is it based on arbitrary speculation? 
 
 
 
 (2) Did the officer err by not considering that the applicant had been granted refugee status in Belgium? 
 
 
 
 (3) Did the officer err in her consideration of the best interests of the child or breach procedural fairness by not informing the applicant that he could raise the best interests of his child? 
 
 
 
 (4) Did the officer breach procedural fairness by not informing the applicant that he could obtain an exemption because of his age? 
 
 
 
 (5) Did the officer breach procedural fairness by not disclosing to the applicant the documents she was relying on to make her decision, thereby depriving him of the opportunity to respond to that evidence?
