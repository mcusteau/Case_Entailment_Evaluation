  The applicant claims that the officer did not give adequate reasons for her decision and relied on speculation rather than reasonable grounds, as section 33 of the  
 IRPA 
  requires; in support of his argument, he relies on the wording of the letter advising him that his application for permanent residence had been denied, and specifically on the following sentence (reproduced at paragraph 10 of these reasons): "It appears that you are a person described in subparagraphs (1)(c) and (f) of section 34 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  ( 
 IRPA 
 )." He also states, but without really explaining his thought, that the immigration officer did not clearly indicate what she meant by "terrorism" and how it applied to his specific case.
