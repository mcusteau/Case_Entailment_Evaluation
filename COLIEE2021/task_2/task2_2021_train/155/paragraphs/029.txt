  In this case, the officer chose to apply the definition of "terrorism" in section 83.01 of the  
 Criminal Code 
 . She certainly cannot be faulted for that, and the applicant did not present any arguments to that effect. It is possible that this definition is a little broader than the description of terrorism that the Supreme Court gave in  
 Suresh, 
  above. However, that is not sufficient to make her decision unreasonable. On the one hand, it must be noted that the Supreme Court indicated that the notion of terrorism in section 19 of the  
 Immigration Act 
 , RSC 1985, c I-2 "includes" the description set out at paragraph 27 of these reasons. On the other hand, it was certainly open to the officer to refer to the definition of terrorism inserted into the  
 Criminal Code 
  through the  
 Anti-Terrorist Act, 
  SC 2001, c 41, to the extent that the  
 IRPA 
  states in its preamble (s 3(1)( 
 i 
 )) that one of its objectives is to "promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and by denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or security risks". Last, no one could argue that the acts of violence identified by the officer and committed by the MIR, the FPMR and the Milices rodriguistes are not acts of terrorism, even by adopting a narrower definition of terrorism than the one adopted by Parliament in the  
 Criminal Code 
 .
