  "Terrorism" is not defined as such in the  
 IRPA 
 . It is true that on numerous occasions, this Court has relied on the definition given by the Supreme Court in  
 Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2002 SCC 1 at para 98, [2002] 1 SCR 3 [ 
 Suresh 
 ]: 
 
 
 
 . . . any 'act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act'.
