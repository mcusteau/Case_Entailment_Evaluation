  The refusal letter sent to the applicant is very short and is essentially in the following lines: 
 
 
 
 [translation] 
 
 
 
 It appears that you are a person described in subparagraphs (1)(c) and (f) of section 34 of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  ( 
 IRPA 
 ). I have determined that you are inadmissible to Canada because of your activities in the Milices rodriguistes and the Manuel Rodriguez Patriotic Front, and your membership in the Movement of the Revolutionary Left. The period of your successive affiliation with these three organizations was, according to your statements, from 1987 to 1991. 
 
 
 
 Consequently, your application for permanent residence in Canada is denied.
