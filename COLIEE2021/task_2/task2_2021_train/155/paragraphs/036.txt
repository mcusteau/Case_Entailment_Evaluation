  But, more importantly, the fact that an applicant has been granted refugee status in another country or even in Canada does not relieve an applicant from the burden of demonstrating to the officer dealing with an application for permanent residence that he or she is not inadmissible under the  
 IRPA 
 . In fact, the principles governing inadmissibility on security grounds are completely different from those that regulate refugee status, including the exception provided in Article 1F of the  
 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees 
  [Convention]. In other words, the task of an officer responsible for making a decision on an application for permanent residence consists in determining whether the applicant is inadmissible to Canada under the  
 IRPA 
  and the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations 
  SOR/2002-227 [Regulations], not to analyze his or her application in the context of the Convention 
 . 
  Subsection 21(1) of the  
 IRPA 
  and subparagraph 72(1)( 
 e 
 )(i) of the Regulations are clear and state that a foreign national can obtain permanent residence only if he or she has complied with the  
 IRPA 
  and is not inadmissible. These provisions refer explicitly to section 4 of the  
 IRPA 
  dealing with inadmissibility, which includes section 34 with respect to inadmissibility on security grounds.
