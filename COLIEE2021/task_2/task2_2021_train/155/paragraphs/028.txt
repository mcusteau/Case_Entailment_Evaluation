  The fact remains that this is not the only possible definition of terrorism, as shown by the variety of wording in international instruments and various national statutes. The Supreme Court, moreover, recognized in  
 Suresh, 
  above, at para 95, that one searches in vain for an authoritative definition of terrorism. In choosing not to define terrorism in the  
 IRPA 
 , the Canadian Parliament refused to restrict itself to a narrow, rigid view of the term and left it to administrative decision-makers and ultimately to the courts to develop the concept flexibly, taking the circumstances into account. Consequently, the reasonableness of an inadmissibility finding related to terrorism will depend not on the decision-maker's application of a precise definition of this concept to the facts of the case but on the fit between the definition chosen (as long as it is reasonable and can be justified in principle) and the evidence on file. See, to the same effect,  
 Daud 
  at para 11;  
 Jalil 
  at para 32.
