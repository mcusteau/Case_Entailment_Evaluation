  The officer then analyzed the applicant's involvement in these different organizations and,  
 inter alia 
 , made the following findings from the documentary evidence and the applicant's oral and written statements: 
 
 
 
 • The applicant admitted that he had been a member of the FPMR and had been [translation] "an internal public leader". In addition, he demonstrated extensive knowledge of the FPMR's structure, its cells and their operation. The documents corroborated the information he gave in this regard; 
 
 
 
 • The officer found that such knowledge of an environment where compartmentalization was a question of life or death and where the members lived and acted in secret and in hiding could only be proportionate to the applicant's degree of involvement and responsibility within the organization; 
 
 
 
 • The applicant's statements in the interview with CIC were inconsistent with the documentary evidence regarding the termination of the FPMR's activities. Contrary to what the applicant maintained, the FPMR continued to exist and to carry out attacks and other acts of violence after 1987 and until 1991. This period corresponds to the time when the applicant was active in the FPMR, according to the first statements made to the CSIS; 
 
 
 
 • The activities and acts admitted by the applicant correspond in all respects to those reported in open source documents and characterize the techniques of both the Milices rodriguistes and the FPMR in their goal to incite the population to what the Chilean Communist Party called [translation] "national insurrection": triggering local and national power outages, systematic use of various explosives for acts of sabotage on a small and large scale, and the operating techniques during operations: surveillance of "safe houses", surveillance during acts of sabotage, logistical support, handling weapons, the role of training, close ties and trust between the FPMR and the Milices, compartmentalization, etc.; 
 
 
 
 • Even though the applicant said he did not play an active role in the acts of violence committed by one or more MIR factions, the officer gave weight to the timelessness factor in section 33 of the  
 IRPA 
  given the knowledge that the applicant had to have had of the nature of the organization because of his involvement in the Chilean Communist Party, the Milices and the FPMR; 
 
 
 
 • The applicant's reasons for leaving Chile remain vague as do the reasons why he is reluctant to return to Chile; 
 
 
 
 • Although the applicant belonged to the Chilean Communist Party at the age of 14, he became active in the Milices rodriguistes at 16 and participated in FPMR operations beginning at the age of 17. In light of the decision in  
 Poshteh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 FCA 85, [2005] 3 FCR 487 [ 
 Poshteh 
 ], she noted that one of the factors to be considered in determining the impact of the status as a minor on inadmissibility is whether the minor has the requisite knowledge or mental capacity to understand the nature and effect of his or her actions, and that the closer the minor is to 18 years of age, the greater will be the likelihood that he or she possesses this knowledge or capacity.
