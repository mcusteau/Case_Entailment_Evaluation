  In reaching its determination that the Applicants had not demonstrated that they had taken all reasonable steps in the circumstances to seek state protection with respect to the incident that occurred in December 2008, the RPD twice noted that they did not ask to speak to a police supervisor, did not go to a different police station, did not complain to the local Roma self-government about the lack of police assistance and did not complain to any other authority in Hungary. In short, the Applicants only made one attempt to report the incident and then failed to pursue the matter further.
