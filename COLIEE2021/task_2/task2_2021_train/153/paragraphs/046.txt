  In this context, I am satisfied that the RPD's conclusion falls "within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" ( 
 Dunsmuir, above, 
  at para 47). The conclusion was also appropriately justified, intelligible and transparent. On the facts of this case, the RPD's decision was "reasonable in light of the outcome and the reasons" that were given ( 
 Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board) 
 , 2011 SCC 62, [2011] 3 SCR 708, at para 15).
