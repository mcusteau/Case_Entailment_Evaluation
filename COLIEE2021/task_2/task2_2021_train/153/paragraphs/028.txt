  Nevertheless, the RPD's misunderstanding or misapplication of the "adequate state protection" test is not necessarily fatal in cases where, as here, the RPD also reasonably concluded on other grounds that the Applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection with "clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect [them]." In this case, those grounds were the failure of the Applicants to demonstrate that they had taken all objectively reasonable steps to avail themselves of state protection, and to provide compelling or persuasive evidence to explain their failure to do more than make a single attempt to seek protection from the police. As discussed below, it is clear from various parts of the decision that these were very important considerations for the RPD, and, indeed, provided an alternate basis for the RPD's decision. Having regard to the RPD's determinations on these points, its decision was not unreasonable.
