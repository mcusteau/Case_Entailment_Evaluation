  Relying upon  
 Pinter v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2012 FC 1119, at para 14, the Applicants also asserted that the police had an obligation to investigate the complaint, even if their assailants were unknown. I do not read that case as standing for such a stark proposition. The failure of the police in that case to further investigate the applicants' complaints in relation to attackers who could not be identified was simply a matter that the Court described as "troubling" at the end of its decision, and after identifying other grounds for setting aside the RPD's decision. However, if I am wrong in this regard, then I respectfully disagree. I am not aware of any obligation on the police in Canada to take further steps to investigate in these types of situations, and it is settled law that claimants for refugee protection are not entitled to greater protection in their home country than is available in Canada (
