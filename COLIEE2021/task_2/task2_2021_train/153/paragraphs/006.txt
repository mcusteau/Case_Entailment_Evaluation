  Mr. Ruszo alleges that his two youngest children were segregated together with other Roma children and apart from other children at their primary school, and that his eldest son was constantly harassed at his school. This harassment included being spat at and yelled at, and having their coats, bags and other things taken from them. The number of complaints from Roma parents regarding similar harassment of their children was such that the local government hired guards to work at the school.
