  Despite the difficulties that have arisen in this case, it appears that the parties have endeavored to work together in order to try to find the best way to address the challenges presented by Mr. Romans' case. The parties are encouraged to continue to consult with each other, and, to the extent possible, with Mr. Romans' health care providers, in order to identify potential options for conditions for Mr. Romans' release in order to assist the Board in its task.
