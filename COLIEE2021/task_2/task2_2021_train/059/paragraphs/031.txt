 [31] 
  The Minister raises three issues on this application. These are: 
 
 
 
 1. Whether the Board provided compelling reasons for departing from decisions rendered in previous detention reviews; 
 
 
 
 2. Whether the Board erred in finding that Mr. Romans' detention had become indefinite; and 
 
 
 
 3. Whether the Board erred in refusing to attach any conditions to Mr. Romans' release.
