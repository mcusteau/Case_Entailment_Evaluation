 [74] 
  Section 58(3) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  empowers the Board to impose any conditions that it deems appropriate in releasing an individual from detention. While it would clearly have been beyond the jurisdiction of the Board to order that Mr. Romans be detained under the provisions of provincial mental health legislation, it would have been entirely open to it to order, at a minimum, that Mr. Romans' release be made conditional upon his designated representative providing the Board with satisfactory evidence that he was receiving appropriate medical care as an involuntary patient in a secure facility, so that the safety of the public could be protected.
