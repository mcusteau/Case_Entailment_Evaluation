The plaintiffs' counsel avers that his clients' "hard case" against the defendant resides in an episode reported in the affidavit of one, Gordon McDermid, a product buyer for Brathwaites Ltd., of Winnipeg, whose business includes the wholesale of prescription drugs to pharmacists and hospitals. Counsel is correct in that regard, but the plaintiffs' "hard case" still does not amount to a prima facie case because of its deficiencies which raise more questions than are answered in terms of furnishing reasonable and probable grounds to induce the court to issue a show cause order to the defendant.
