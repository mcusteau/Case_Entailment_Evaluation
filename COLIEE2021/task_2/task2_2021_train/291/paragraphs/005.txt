Among the depositions tendered by the plaintiff in support of this application is the affidavit of Keltie Sim, sworn in Toronto on February 6, 1989. Attached to Ms. Sim's affidavit, as Exhibit J, are copies of two letters from Apotex' solicitors both dated January 30, 1989, addressed to the plaintiffs' solicitors. The pertinent passages of those exhibited letters run as follow:
"Your letter of January 27, 1989 has come to my attention this morning.
. . . . .
"I am instructed that the atenolol that my client is currently offering for sale is Canadian made. Consequently there is no breach nor contempt of the Order of Rouleau, J.
. . . . .
"Further to my earlier letter of even date, my client advises me that the first quantities of Canadian atenolol were received by it on January 13, 1989.
"These materials were subjected to quality control and commercially available quantities were not finally assured until later.
"In compliance with His Lordship's order, no atenolol was shipped between the 12th and 24th of January. Atenolol shipped since January 24th was from Canadian sources.
"I draw your attention to the fact that when Dr. Sherman was originally cross-examined in these proceedings he advised that Apotex was searching for a Canadian source.
"Further, if I recall correctly, he also advised that Apotex had no intention of importing further atenolol for sale in Canada."
