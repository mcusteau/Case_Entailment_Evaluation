An important issue was raised concerning the admissibility of certain documents obtained indirectly as the result of the Anton Piller order. The Anton Piller order required inter alia that the respondents Lam, Liu and Wu in action T-664-87 advise the applicant's solicitors, if requested, of the location of documentary evidence relevant to the business affairs of them and their companies. According to the evidence, on the occasion of the raid one of the solicitors for the applicant asked about certain invoices which appeared to be missing from the files at the premises raided, and was told by Mr. Wu that customs officers had seized a number of such documents. This was on March 31, 1987. It appears that counsel for the applicant then tried to get access to these documents. Revenue Canada refused to give such access without the consent of counsel for the respondents herein. Respondents' counsel refused consent. Ultimately counsel for the applicant applied to the County Court of British Columbia, pursuant to provisions in the Criminal Code, for access to these documents and this was granted on October 23, 1987. These documents were then produced in court by Inspector Galbraith, a senior investigator with Revenue Canada. Counsel for the respondents argued that such evidence should not be admitted because its submission would be contrary to ss. 8, 11(c), 13, and 24 of the Charter. Reliance was also placed on s. 2(d) of the Canadian Bill of Rights. It was further argued that production of documents or discovery ought not to be ordered in penal matters. It was argued that the documentary evidence in question was the "fruit of the forbidden tree": it had been obtained on the basis of information gained in contravention of the Charter of Rights and should therefore not be admitted.
