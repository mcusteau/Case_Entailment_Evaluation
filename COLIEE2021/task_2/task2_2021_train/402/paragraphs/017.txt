While the sale of these Apple-compatible computers which had commenced before the issue of the injunction continued thereafter, important questions remain as to whether the computers in question were such as to be covered by the original injunction issued by Walsh, J., and continued by Giles, A.S.P. The respondents contend that the computers they imported and sold were not covered by the injunction, because: they did not contain the prohibited program described in the injunctions; the cases of the computers sold were not proven to be copies of the "applicant's two-dimensional drawings" as referred to in the injunctions; and there was no infringement of the trademark "Apple Logo and Design" of the plaintiff because the symbols used by the respondents on their machines were dissimilar to that logo and, in any event, were not used as trade marks. These contentions must be examined in turn.
