Counsel for the respondents argued that these proceedings involve the possibility of committal to prison of the individual respondents. Therefore by rules 1903 and 1905 there must be proof that such respondents were served personally with a copy of the orders allegedly violated, and that on such orders there should have been an endorsement that if the person served disobeyed the order he would be liable to "process of execution to compel him to obey it" as specified in rule 1905(4). I do not accept this argument. The present proceedings are under rule 355 dealing with contempt of court generally. Rule 355(5) states that the procedure set out in rule 355 is an alternative to committal under rule 2500. Rules 1903 and 1905 are included in Part VII of the Federal Court Rules as is rule 2500 and it appears to me that the requirements of rule 1905 with respect to notice relate to a proceeding for committal under rule 2500. (Beloit Canada Limitee/Limited et al v. Valmet Oy (1986), 6 F.T.R. 241; 11 C.P.R.(3d) 470, at 476 (F.C.T.D.). It has been held in this court that rule 2500 cannot be used in cases such as the present where a finding of contempt has not yet been made: Selection Testing Consultations International Ltd. v. Humanex International Inc. et al. (1987), 9 F.T.R. 72 (F.C.T.D.).) In my view this is so even where the alleged contempt consists of breach of an injunction and clearly it is so where the alleged contempt is that of acting so as to interfere with the orderly administration of justice and to impair the authority of the Court and to render nugatory the injunction or order. (See Baxter Travenol Laboratories of Canada Ltd. et al. v. Cutter (Canada) Ltd. (1984), 1 C.P.R.(3d) 433, where persons were held liable for contempt of court where they had merely been informed of the existence of reasons for the issuance of an injunction, with respect to acts committed even before the injunction was issued: clearly there was neither service of an order nor notice under rule 1905 prior to the issue of the order, yet there was liability for contempt.) Courts operating under other rules have indicated that there can be contempt for breach of an order of the Court where the contemnor has been made aware of the order even if not served with a copy of it (see, e.g., Moose Mountain Lumber and Hardware Co. v. Paradis (1910), 14 W.L.R. 20 at 22, 23 (Sask. S.C.); Churchman et al v. Joint Shop Stewards' Committee, [1972] 3 All E.R. 603, at 606 (C.A.); Glazier v. Union Contractors Ltd. et al. (1960), 129 C.C.C. 150 (B.C.C.A.); Canada Metal Co. Ltd. et al. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. et al. (1975), 48 D.L.R.(3d) 641 (Ont. H.C.), affd. 11 O.R.(2d) 167 (Ont. C.A.)) and I believe that is the proper approach to the interpretation of rule 355.
