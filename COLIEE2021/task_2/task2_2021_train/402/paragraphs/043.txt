Strayer, J.
: On March 15, 1988 in Vancouver I sentenced the respondents Minitronics of Canada Limited, Angel Li Lam, O.S. Micro Systems Inc., Comtex Micro System Inc., Lami Yee Lam, Jack Liu, and Jack Wu for contempt of court in respect of their violations of interim and interlocutory injunctions issued in this matter. I gave brief reasons orally for the sentences and will set out those reasons more precisely here.
