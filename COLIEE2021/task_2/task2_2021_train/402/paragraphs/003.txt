A statement of claim was filed in this action on September 25, 1985. In it the plaintiff (the applicant in this motion) alleged that the various defendants were engaged in importing, assembling, distributing, selling, etc., and - in the case of one defendant - purchasing, certain computers. They were alleged to infringe the plaintiff's rights because, inter alia: the said computers allegedly incorporated programs of the plaintiff which are the subject of copyright; such computers use the design of the case of the plaintiff's computer and thus infringe an unregistered copyright of the plaintiff in the drawings thereof; and such computers bear symbols which are confusing with the plaintiff's logo, thus infringing the plaintiff's trademark.
