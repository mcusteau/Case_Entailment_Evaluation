On the question of whether the respondents' symbol is confusing, I have applied the accepted test of the "first impression" (see e.g., Oshawa Group Ltd. v. Creative Resources Co. Ltd. (1982), 46 N.R. 426; 61 C.P.R.(2d) 29, at 36-37 (F.C.A.); Leaf Confection Ltd. v. Maple Leaf Gardens Ltd. (1986), 7 F.T.R. 72; 12 C.P.R.(3d) 511, at 521 (F.C.T.D.).) and I have concluded that it is confusing. While the respondents contend that their symbols, being circular, would not be confused with the natural apple-shape with a bite out of the side as used in the applicant's logo, I believe that the average person, seeing the respondents' computer separate from the computer of the applicant, could easily be misled into thinking that the respondents were using the Apple logo. This could in turn lead them to think that such a computer was also made by Apple. At page 6 of his reasons for the injunction, Walsh, J., concluded that the use of "some circular device with or without a stem" on such keys of the keyboard "would most likely be an infringement" of the applicant's trademark, and the injunction was issued to implement that decision. I have equally concluded that the respondents' symbol is confusing.
