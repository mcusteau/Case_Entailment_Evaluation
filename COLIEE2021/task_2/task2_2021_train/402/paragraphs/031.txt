As noted above, the respondents further contend that even if their symbol is confusing with the applicant's trademark it is not being used as a trademark within the meaning of ss. 2 and 4 of the Trade Marks Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. T-10, and therefore there cannot be confusion as described in s. 6 of that Act. To support this argument, counsel relied on two cases (Clairol International Corporation et al. v. Thomas Supply & Equipment Co. Ltd. et al. (1968), 38 Fox's P.C. 176 (Ex. Ct.); Bombardier Ltd. v. British Petroleum Co. Ltd. et al. (1973), 10 C.P.R.(2d) 21 (F.C.A.).) in which marks, when used on material or packages of someone other than the owner of the mark, were held not to be used as trademarks. In my view those cases are irrelevant as they clearly dealt with situations where the trademark of another was reproduced on a package for purposes of showing how the packager's product might be used in connection with the product of the owner of that trademark. In each case it was obvious from the context that the other's trademark was not being applied to a package to indicate the source of that package. In the present case these circumstances do not exist. The respondents' symbol, which I find to be confusing with the logo of the applicant, is used on two keys of the keyboard of their computers in exactly the same way that Apple uses its logo on its keyboards, and the natural inference which a member of the public would draw is that the respondents' computers are somehow from the same source as those of Apple.
