Section 15 was interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case of
Grillas v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1972] S.C.R. 577, at 590 to confer upon Immigration Appeal Board a continuous "equitable jurisdiction" to reopen hearings whenever new evidence that would justify granting the humanitarian remedy contained in s. 15 came to light. The C.R.D.D. is no longer vested with this ongoing jurisdiction, although s. 114(2) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, as amended (the "
Act
") allows the Governor-in-Council, by regulation, to authorize the Minister to exempt any person from any regulation made under s. 114(1) and to facilitate the admission of any person where, in the Minister's opinion, that person should be exempted or where humanitarian and compassionate considerations exist.
