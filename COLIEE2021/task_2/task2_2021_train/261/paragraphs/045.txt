Under the post 1993
Guidelines
, the nature of the determination by post-claim determination officers is twofold: an assessment is first made whether the claimant is within any of the traditional categories of exclusion and then whether the claimant:
"... will be subject to recognizable risks if forced to leave Canada. The risk must be personal, objectively identifiable and compelling. The risk must consist of a threat to life, excessive sanctions or inhumane treatment, in all parts of country to which they would be removed. This is the case whether the claimant is removed directly to that country or indirectly through a (sic) intermediate country."
