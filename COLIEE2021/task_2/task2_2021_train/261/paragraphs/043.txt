In my opinion, s. 114(2) and the Minister's practice in connection with that provision ensures that claimants have a "meaningful opportunity" to have new evidence of changed country conditions heard by an "authoritative body", in the spirit of the Federal Court of Appeal's decisions in
Chiarelli
and
Grewal
, and therefore does not violate s. 7. It is clear from Employment and Immigration Canada's
Examination and Enforcement Guidelines
for s. 114(2) that existed both prior to 1993 (Document IE-9, February 1991) (the "pre-1993
Guidelines
") and subsequent to 1993 (Document OM IS-19 93, June 1993) (the "post 1993
Guidelines
") that humanitarian and compassionate review has been and continues to be available to refused refugee claimants who are in the position of the applicants. In fact, since 1993, the process of humanitarian and compassionate review is automatic.
