Although the goal of upholding Canada's humanitarian tradition with respect to the displaced and the persecuted is an important factor in determining the procedural safeguards required pursuant to s. 7 in the context of Convention refugee claims, it does not stand alone. In the context of refugee claims such as those in the present case, where the merits of a claim have already been finally determined once in a full oral hearing, adherence to s. 7 of the
Charter
is not and cannot be dictated by a requirement that, every time the rights of a party are affected, a full, oral, quasi-judicial hearing must be held. What would stop a claimant from applying for a new C.R.D.D. hearing, each and every time a new piece of trivial evidence arose? As Dussault and Borgeat warn, if fundamental justice were to be applied mechanically so as to impose a court-like paradigm on such administrative structures:
"... it would make it virtually impossible for the courts to take into account the immense difficulties that an imposition of overly strict procedural requirements would mean for various agencies working in fields of mass adjudication as is the case, for example, of the Immigration Appeal Board or of federal and provincial Parole boards."
