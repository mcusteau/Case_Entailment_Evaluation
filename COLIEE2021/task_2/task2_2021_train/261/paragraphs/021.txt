It is clear that Mr. Justice Sopinka, writing for the majority of the Supreme Court, was of the view that "functus officio", a principle developed with a view to creating a workable division of jurisdiction between trial courts and courts of appeal, should not be as rigidly applied in the context of administrative tribunals, where there is evidence of legislative intent against a strict approach. According to Mr. Justice Sopinka, the doctrine (at page 142):
"... is based, however, on the policy ground which favours finality of proceedings rather than the rule which was developed with respect to formal judgments of a court whose decision was subject to a full appeal. For this reason, I am of the opinion that its application must be more flexible and less formalistic in respect to the decisions of administrative tribunals which are subject to appeal only on a point of law. Justice may require the reopening of administrative proceedings in order to provide relief which would otherwise be available on appeal.
"
Accordingly, the principle should not be strictly applied where there are indications in the enabling statute that a decision can be reopened in order to enable the tribunal to discharge the function committed to it by enabling legislation
