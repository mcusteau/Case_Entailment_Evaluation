The first observation to be made is that rule 30 refers only to applications for reinstatement of withdrawn claims and applications for
rehearing
but not to applications for
reopening proceedings
. While counsel for the applicants was quick to point out that
Nabiye, Singh
and
Longia
were decided in the era of the Immigration Appeal Board, which did not have jurisdiction conferred upon it by the legislation and rules to reopen, at least one case, that of
Salinas v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1992), 142 N.R. 211; 93 D.L.R.(4th) 631 (F.C.A.), has been decided in the era of rule 30. The Federal Court of Appeal, in
Salinas
, emphasized the distinction between "hearings" and "proceedings". In the words of Mr. Justice Stone:
"In general, the provisions of s. 68 endow the refugee division with powers and duties in relation to any 'proceedings' before it. It is apparent that a distinction has thus been drawn by Parliament between 'proceedings' and a 'hearing' before the refugee division which is to be conducted in the manner required by s. 69.1 of the
Act
. A 'hearing' is but a step, albeit an important step, in any 'proceedings' which is a wider term encompassing the entire matter before the refugee division including the hearing of the claim itself."
