Does rule 30 provide a mechanism to allow the reassessment of claims where a failed refugee claimant becomes at risk subsequent to a negative C.R.D.D. decision? According to the applicants, the power to create rules, contained under s. 65 of the
Act
is broad in scope and contains no prohibition against creating a rule which allows the Board to consider an application to reopen. Given that the issue of rehearing on successful appeals is already dealt with under rule 31 and given that rule 9 vests the Minister with the reciprocal power to request a reopening where potential fraud exists or where a change of circumstances occurs in the refugee's country of nationality, the applicants submit that the only meaningful interpretation for rule 30 is that it would contemplate circumstances when the C.R.D.D. has already rendered a decision and when new evidence has arisen to warrant a reopening of the refugee claim. With due respect, I cannot agree with this proposition.
