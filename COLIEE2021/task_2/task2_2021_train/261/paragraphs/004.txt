Although the applicant lists six matters in issue, this application, in essence, raises two issues:
1. Whether, notwithstanding the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[see Footnote 1] (the "
Charter
"), the C.R.D.D. erred in law in holding that it could not reopen a matter; and
2. Whether the Board erred in law by failing to read into the
Immigration Act
and the
Rules
such powers as are necessary and within the jurisdiction of the C.R.D.D. so as to comply with the principles of fundamental justice.
