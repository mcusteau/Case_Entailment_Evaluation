Mr. Justice Stone went on to hold that, while the proceedings were still pending (and, thus, finality had not been reached), the doctrine of "functus officio" did not apply and the C.R.D.D. should be free to exercise its legislative mandate - which included the power to consider evidence of changed country conditions that arose subsequent to the applicant's hearing but prior to the C.R.D.D.'s decision being rendered. In taking this approach, instead of allowing the new evidence to be considered regardless of whether a decision had been rendered as of yet by the C.R.D.D., it is clear that Mr. Justice Stone felt constrained by the doctrine of "functus officio".
