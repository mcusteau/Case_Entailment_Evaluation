  In  
 Mugesera v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2005 SCC 40, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 100 at para. 114, the Supreme Court of Canada described the "reasonable grounds to believe" evidentiary standard as requiring "something more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities". The Supreme Court went on to hold that reasonable grounds to believe will exist "where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information": at para. 114.
