The Board noted that while the applicant was granted admission as a visitor for the first six months and may not have felt a pressing need to make a claim during this time, he was unable to explain his later delays. The Board found this delay to be all the more unexplainable given that according to the applicant's Personal Information Form (PIF), he spoke with a lawyer who advised him to make a refugee claim "a few months" after arriving in Canada:
"At one point, he said he was focused upon earning money. At another point, he said that the peace and tranquility he found in Canada had lulled his sense of danger. He had apparently lost all sense of time. Asked what would have happened if his illegal status had been discovered, the claimant had no reply to give. Asked if he had gone into the Internet to find out information on how to make a claim, he replied that he had not. All this is extremely surprising in that the claimant had four years study of law in Mexico and was on the verge of graduating with a degree in law. If any claimant was equipped to inform himself on the Canadian refugee system, this was the claimant. Yet he did nothing."
