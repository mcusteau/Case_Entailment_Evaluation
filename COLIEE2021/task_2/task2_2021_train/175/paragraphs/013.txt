  In  
 Martin v. Canada (Minister of Human Resources Development) 
  [see footnote 10] the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal from the decision [see footnote 11] of Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer who had dismissed an application for judicial review in relation to a decision by the Vice-Chairman of the PAB denying leave to appeal from a decision of the Review Tribunal. She had identified the appropriate test for the reviewing court as one requiring deference, unless the decision maker considered irrelevant factors or acted contrary to the law. The Court of Appeal, reviewing the Vice-Chairman's decision and referring to Madam Justice Reed's decision in  
 Kerth 
  and her identification of the appropriate test for a Court reviewing a decision concerning an application for leave to appeal, found that in  
 Martin 
  the leave decision maker went further than merely considering whether an arguable case or question of law or jurisdiction had been raised. In its view, in that case the Vice-Chairman had erred by considering whether the applicant for leave could succeed on the merits of the application. There the Court of Appeal found there was an arguable case concerning the proper interpretation of subparagraph 42(2)(a)(ii) of the  
 Canada Pension Plan 
 , which requires, for a disability to be severe, that the claimant be "incapable regularly of pursuing any substantially gainful employment". The Court of Appeal found the Review Tribunal, and the decision maker considering the leave application assumed the appellant had to show that he is "incapable of doing any type of work". Thus in the view of the Court of Appeal the application for leave raised an arguable issue.
