  In review of these concerns in relation to the decision of the Tribunal, without considering the merits of the leave application except to assess whether it raises an arguable case, it is my opinion that: 
 
 
 
 1. Even if one member of the Tribunal demonstrated little or no knowledge of one of the conditions claimed to affect the applicant, that in itself raises no grounds for finding bias or a lack of impartiality on the part of that one member or of the three person tribunal. There is no requirement that a member of the tribunal have knowledge of each of the many conditions that underlie a claim for disability benefits. A member's decision is not based on his or her own understanding of medical conditions, but upon his or her assessment of the reports of medical examiners, reports which are provided in the main by the applicant for benefits. 
 
 
 
 2. The concern that insufficient attention was paid to the later and to certain medical reports is in essence a concern about the weight given by the Tribunal to particular aspects of the evidence before it. Insofar as the concern relates to particular factual references in the Tribunal's decision, in my opinion any such factual errors by the Tribunal are not basic to its ultimate decision, which is dependent upon the medical evidence in the record. 
 
 
 
 3. Finally, the Tribunal relied upon and applied the definition of "disabled" as provided under the Plan by subs. 42(2), as it is required to do, whatever other definitions there may be by dictionaries or even by other statutes, for example the Alberta legislation.
