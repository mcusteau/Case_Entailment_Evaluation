  In the case at bar the applicant raises one additional item of "evidence" that was not before the Review Tribunal when it reached its decision in September 1997, but was submitted subsequent to his application for leave to appeal by a letter, sent by fax, undated but received by the PAB on July 17, 1998. The letter briefly advised that as of July 1, 1998 the applicant was awarded "AISH disability", and asked that this be considered when decisions are made in regard to his file. The decision to deny leave makes no reference to this information, and the applicant urges that the decision was in error in ignoring this. Particularly, it was urged when this application for judicial review was heard, that the error is obvious when the requirement of severe disability under the province of Alberta AISH program is said to be the same as that under the Canada Pension Plan. Indeed, Mr. Callihoo bases his application for judicial review upon the following grounds: 
 
 
 
 "1. The applicant has satisfied the criteria of disability as defined by the Alberta Insured for the Severely Handicapped. [see footnote 13] 
 
 
 
 "2. The definition of disabled as employed by AISH is similar to the definition and criteria contemplated by Canada Pension Plan."
