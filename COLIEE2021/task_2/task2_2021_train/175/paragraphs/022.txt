 [22] 
  In the absence of significant new or additional evidence not considered by the Review Tribunal, an application for leave may raise an arguable case where the leave decision maker finds the application raises a question of an error of law, measured by a standard of correctness, or an error of significant fact that is unreasonable or perverse in light of the evidence. The decision maker here found no such error is raised by the application for leave. That decision on the leave application does not contain an error that would be a basis for the Court to intervene.
