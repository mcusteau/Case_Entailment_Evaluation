  In  
 Kerth 
 , relying upon an earlier decision of the Court of Appeal [see footnote 7] in relation to the appropriate test for assessing leave to appeal, Madam Justice Reed concluded that in the case before her the decision maker erred by considering the wrong test, i.e., by considering the merits of the leave application and not, as should have been considered, whether the application raised an arguable case. In  
 Kerth 
  the application for leave raised new or additional evidence not considered by the Review Tribunal, and open for consideration in de novo proceedings before the Appeal Board. In Reed, J.'s, view where the ground for leave is primarily the existence of additional evidence, the issue to be considered in relation to the leave application is whether it raises a genuine doubt as to whether the Tribunal would have reached the decision it did if the additional evidence had been before it.
