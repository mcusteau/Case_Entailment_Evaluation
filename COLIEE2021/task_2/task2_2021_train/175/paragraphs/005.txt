  The applicant then asked for further review of his situation and the request was treated as an application for leave to appeal to the Pension Appeal Board under the  
 Act 
 . That application was considered by a designated member of the Board who denied leave to appeal, dismissing the application in the following terms: 
 
 
 
 "The Review Tribunal, upon hearing all the evidence adduced before it, concluded that the appellant's back problems or his Seasonal Affective Disorder either alone, or collectively fail to meet the strict criteria that would bring Mr. Callihoo, within the definition of severely disabled as set out in the Canada Pension Plan. I have reviewed the medical reports and beleive (sic) that they do not only make the Tribunal finding a reasonable one, the preponderance of the medical opinion supports the Tribunal's conclusion. I see no error in principle on the part of the Tribunal. I do not see a proper foundation for granting leave to appeal. 
 
 
 
 "Accordingly leave to appeal is dismissed."
