  In at least four previous cases before this Court, the standard of review for assessing an administrative decision to cancel or withhold an airport security clearance has been found to be patent unreasonableness: see  
 Fontaine v Canada (Transport), 
  2007 FC 1160, 313 FTR 309;  
 Rivet v Canada (Attorney General), 
  2007 FC 1175, 325 FTR 178;  
 Lavoie v Canada (Attorney General), 
   
 2007 FC 435 
  and  
 Singh v Canada (Attorney General), 
  2006 FC 802. In each of those decisions, the Court recognized the discretionary and specialized nature of the decision under review and the legislative purpose served [see footnote 1]. Of course, since  
 Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 
  2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 SCR 190 the patent unreasonableness standard has been subsumed into a single standard of reasonableness and this is the standard to be applied here. On this issue of procedural fairness the standard of review is, of course, correctness: see  
 Sketchley v Canada (Attorney General), 
  2005 FCA 404, [2006] 3 FCR 392.
