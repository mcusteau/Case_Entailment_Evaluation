  Mr. Clue was issued a TSC by the Minister of Transport on October 20, 2003 and that clearance was renewed on October 10, 2007. In October 2009 Mr. Clue purchased a stolen Air Canada parking pass and, in the result, he was charged with possession of stolen property by the Peel Regional Police. On November 26, 2009 Mr. Clue's TSC was suspended subject to a review of two matters of concern: 
 
 
 
 (a) the then pending criminal prosecution; and 
 
 
 
 (b) an incident on June 6, 2009 involving Mr. Clue's alleged placing of a gym bag containing a loaded handgun onboard an aircraft bound for Jamaica.
