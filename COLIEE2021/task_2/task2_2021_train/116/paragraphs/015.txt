  The decision taken by the Director to cancel Mr. Clue's TSC was made in accordance with the provisions of s 4.8 of the  
 Aeronautics Act 
 , RS, 1985, c A-2, and the Transportation Security Clearance Program (Clearance Program). Ultimately, the decision was made under Article I.4 of the Program which prevents access to a restricted area of a listed airport (e.g. Pearson) where the Minister, represented by the Director, reasonably believes, on a balance of probabilities, that an individual may be prone or induced to commit an act that may unlawfully interfere with civil aviation.
