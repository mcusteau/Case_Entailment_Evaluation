  The respondent submitted that the officer's decision to refuse the applicant on the basis of the non-compliance with the previous TRV was reasonable. The respondent noted that contrary to what was sworn in her affidavit, the applicant did not ensure that throughout her stay in Canada she had observed and respected Canadian immigration laws, nor did she leave immediately upon having her visa refused. Given that in the past the applicant had not followed her stated intention for coming to Canada, the officer had justification for questioning the applicant's present intentions in seeking a work permit.
