  The proper standard of review pre- 
 Dunsmuir 
  of a visa officer's decision was reasonableness simpliciter ( 
 Yin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2001] F.C.J. No. 985 (T.D.);  
 Jhattu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2005), F.C.J. No. 1058). In my opinion, the question of whether the officer failed to meet the conditions of her previous TRV and failed to properly assess her eligibility for the live-in caregiver program is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness in light of  
 Dunsmuir 
  above.
