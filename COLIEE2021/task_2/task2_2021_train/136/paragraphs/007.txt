  The officer's notes concerning the June 21, 2007 interview provide more insight into the reasons provided by the officer in denying the application: 
 
 
 
 PA informs me that she went to CDA as a visitor (V040800781) on 13NOV2004. FOSS record shows PA was denied VR on 17MAY2005. PA left CDA for the US on 01JUN2005, at which time after overstaying her initial TRV and being denied VR, the PA was out of status. 
 
 
 
 PA states she did not go to CDA with her parents as she stated at intv. At Intv PA confirms she stated she would only be in CDA a month. 
 
 
 
 PA states she stayed at her sister's house (now her employer) during the time she was in CDA for 8 mths. 
 
 
 
 PA has clearly previously misrepresented at the very least her intentions on her TRV. Furthermore she then overstayed said visa. 
 
 
 
 PA has a history of not respecting T&Cs of a TRV. 
 
 
 
 I have examined the contents of the file and not withstanding the submissions of the PA, based on her past history, of not respecting the T&Cs of her previous TRV, I am not satisfied he [ 
 sic 
 ] is a BF Temp Resident as mentioned in A20(1)(b).
