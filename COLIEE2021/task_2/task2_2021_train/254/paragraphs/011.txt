In the case of Bachoo, she is a citizen of Tanzania, married with two children and is a dressmaker. She filed her I.M.M.8 with supporting documents and the prescribed filing fee in Nairobi on May 29, 1989, indicating she had relatives in Canada willing to assist her. She was notified by letter dated June 22, 1989 that her assessment did not indicate that she met selection criteria, but as she had a relative in Canada willing to assist, she could contact her relative and have her obtain an undertaking of assistance. She had been assessed as a "seamstress" as opposed to "dressmaker" but at the time she filed her application, the occupational demand for both was fixed at one point. Form 1344, the undertaking of assistance, was obtained and submitted on November 20, 1989.
