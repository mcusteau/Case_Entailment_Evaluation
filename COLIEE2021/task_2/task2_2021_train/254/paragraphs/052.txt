I conclude however, that even if this were an administrative decision it would be a breach of fairness not to make the assessment on the basis of the date of the original application and payment of fee whether it be an independent application, or an assisted relative application, and that certiorari should be issued to quash the adverse decisions in these three cases, together with a mandamus directing that they be assessed on this basis.
Applications allowed.
