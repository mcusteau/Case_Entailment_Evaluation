The Department controls the flow of immigrants into Canada to a large extent, at least in the case of independent or assisted relative categories, by varying the points awarded for occupational demand from time to time, not only by reducing them as conditions vary, but even by reducing them to zero, thus effectively cutting off all immigration in these categories by operation of s. 11, unless the applicant has arranged employment in Canada or is prepared to engage in employment in a designated occupation, or unless the visa officer avails himself of the comparatively rare exception in s. 11 that the units of assessment do not reflect the chances of the applicant and his dependents of becoming successfully established in Canada.
