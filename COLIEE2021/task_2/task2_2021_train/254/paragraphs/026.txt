It should be noted that this "locking in" policy only applied when the occupational units for the applicant's occupation were reduced to zero and not merely to one as in this case. It is also of importance to note that the Department is no longer willing to "lock in" these points as of the date of the initial application, now that occupational demand has been reduced for all occupations to zero, insisting that for assisted relative applications it is the date of receipt of the Undertaking of Assistance which governs, notwithstanding that no additional fee is payable at that time. As a result, applicants argue that this is merely a procedural formality necessary before finally assessing the initial application at which date the points allocated for occupational demand must be applied.
