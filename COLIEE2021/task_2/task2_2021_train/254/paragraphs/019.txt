The only differences in the three applications appear to be that in the
Yeung
case the Undertaking of Assistance had not yet been provided by January 30, 1991 whereas in the
Bachoo
and
Kwon
cases it had been. In
Kwon's
case it was submitted on December 5, 1990, at which time the occupational demand for "manager, sales" had been reduced to one point from the eight points allowed at the time of his application on September 14, 1988. Nevertheless he was still entitled to the critical one point. In the
Yeung
case there was no prescreening before the application was filed. This was a procedure, no doubt useful in weeding out applicants who had no hope of obtaining the necessary points before they filed a formal application, saving both them and the department time and money. Bachoo and Kwon both by-passed this and their applications were dealt with as assisted relative applications. Most applications at the time were subject to the prescreening process and department policy was to discourage the issuing of an R-2 letter without which, at the time, the Undertaking of Assistance form would not be given to the relative in Canada, until the prescreening had taken place. In the prescreening, no points are allotted for "personal suitability" for which up to ten points may be allowed, as this can only be assessed after a personal interview with the applicant. The prescreening arises from a Preliminary Application Questionnaire (PAQ) form given prospective applicants by the visa officers abroad. Neither the
Act
nor
Regulations
make any provision for it, however, nor is an independent applicant prohibited from filing an application directly, as Yeung and the other applicants here did.
