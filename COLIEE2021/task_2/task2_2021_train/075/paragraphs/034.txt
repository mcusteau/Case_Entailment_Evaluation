  I note that it is well-established in Canadian law that rape, and other forms of sexual assault, are crimes grounded in the status of women in society. In  
 R. v. Osolin 
 , [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595; 162 N.R. 1; 38 B.C.A.C. 81; 62 W.A.C. 81, Justice Cory writing for the majority held at page 669: 
 
 
 
 "... It cannot be forgotten that a sexual assault is very different from other assaults. It is true that it, like all the other forms of assault, is an act of violence. Yet it is something more than a simple act of violence. Sexual assault is in the vast majority of cases gender based. It is an assault upon human dignity and constitutes a denial of any concept of equality for women." 
 
 
 
 Also in  
 R. v. Seaboyer and Gayme 
 , [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577; 128 N.R. 81; 48 O.A.C. 81, L'Heureux-Dub√©, J., (dissenting in part) framed her legal analysis of the constitutionality of the "rape-shield" provisions in the  
 Criminal Code 
  around the fact that "[s]exual assault is not like any other crime".
