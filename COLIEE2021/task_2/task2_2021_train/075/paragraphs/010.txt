  Notably, the Board highlighted the following information as relevant to its assessment of the objective quality of the applicant's fear: 1) the Prime Minister of Haiti is a woman; and 2) half of Haiti's population of 8 million are women. Directly following these facts, the Board found that the risk the applicant fears is one rooted in a general problem of criminality in that country. And, that fearing the risk of rape is not from gender, but "rather [it is] a risk that is faced by all Haitian citizens as a result of the violence in their country". In conclusion, the Board stated: "[t]he jurisprudence has held that victims of generalized violence or potential victims of generalized violence such as the claimants are not afforded refugee protection."
