  In this case, the Applicant holds no unqualified right to enter and to remain in Canada:  
 Chiarelli, ibid, 
  at pages 733-34. He applied for permanent residence under the federal skilled worker class and the process under the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
  and the Regulations provides for an assessment of clear and specific criteria under a points system leaving little discretion to visa officers and which does not normally require an interview or other hearing with applicants. The nature of the regulatory scheme, the role of the decision of the visa officer in the overall scheme, and the choice of procedure made do not therefore suggest the need for strong procedural safeguards beyond what is already provided for in the legislation, save the procedural safeguard concerning proper information to applicants as to the criteria used and the documentation required to properly assess their applications. Though the decision to grant or not an application for permanent residence under the federal skilled worker class is obviously important to the individual affected, it is not such as to affect the fundamental freedoms or other fundamental rights of an applicant, such as a criminal proceeding or, in the immigration context, a deportation proceeding might have. In addition, no undertakings are made to applicants as to an interview or as to additional notification if documentation is missing or insufficient, thus considerably limiting expectations of applicants in such matters.
