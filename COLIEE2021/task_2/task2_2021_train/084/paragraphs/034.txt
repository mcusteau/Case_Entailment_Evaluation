 [34] 
  In this case, the Applicant argues that the terms of the May 15, 2008 letter of instruction fettered the visa officer's discretion to consider affidavits and statutory declarations. The letter stated the following: 
 
 
 
 3. Please provide copies of documents which show that your (or your accompanying spouse's) relative is residing in Canada. These can include documents such as income tax information, latest pay slips, credit card statements etc. Affidavits and statutory declarations are  
 not 
  satisfactory proof of residence in Canada.
