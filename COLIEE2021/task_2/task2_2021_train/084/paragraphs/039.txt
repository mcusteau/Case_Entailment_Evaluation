  The Respondent's position on this argument is that the immigration officer was functus officio and consequently could not reconsider the decision once it has been issued. This position is at odds with the recent decision of  
 Kurukkal v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2009 FC 695, [2009] F.C.J. No. 866, in which Justice Mactavish found that the doctrine of functus officio does not apply to the informal non-adjudicative decision-making process involved in the determination of applications for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The reasoning of Justice Mactavish in  
 Kurukkal 
  extends as well to decisions of immigration officers under the federal skilled worker class as noted by Justice Snider in  
 Sharma v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2009 FC 789, [2009] F.C.J. No. 910.
