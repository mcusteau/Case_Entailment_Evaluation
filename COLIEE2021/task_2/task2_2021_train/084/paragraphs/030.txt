  One of the arguments raised by the Applicant is that if the immigration officer was of the mind to refuse the statutory declaration of the Applicant's brother, he was then under a duty of fairness to inform the Applicant of the matter and give him an opportunity to respond. This argument fails both on the facts and on the applicable legal principles. Indeed, from a factual perspective, the Applicant was clearly notified in writing that affidavits and statutory declarations would not be considered in these circumstances. He was further notified in writing that the immigration officials would not send him any further request for documentation. Consequently the Applicant was properly notified, and he disregarded that notice. In such circumstances, a second notice was not required to be sent to the Applicant.
