  Moreover, the fettering of discretion argument has no application in the particular circumstances of the Applicant. Indeed, had this been a case where the Applicant had no other means of establishing his brother's residence in Canada than through an affidavit or statutory declaration and had made representations to the visa officer on this basis, there could have possibly been an argument for sustaining that the visa officer acted improperly by not considering the particular personal circumstances. However, this is not the situation here. Indeed the Applicant could easily have accessed the required documentation to establish that his brother was living in Canada and in fact did access additional information shortly after the decision was communicated to him. In such circumstances, the Applicant cannot now raise a fettering of discretion argument.
