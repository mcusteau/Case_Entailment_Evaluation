  Support for the Applicant's position cannot be found in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in  
 Muliadi v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , supra, since this decision concerned the duty to provide a fair opportunity to a visa applicant in order to contradict a third party negative assessment which had not been provided to the applicant prior to the decision being made. This is not the factual situation here, and consequently  
 Muliadi 
  has no application to this case. Moreover, the Federal Court of Canada decision of  
 Yang v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , supra, raised by the Applicant is neither of assistance to the Applicant's case since this decision was based on issues other than procedural fairness. In any event, Justice Jerome in  
 Yang 
  did note that the visa officer had provided the applicant in that case with a notice to provide additional documentation, but then proceeded to decide the application prior to receiving the requested documentation. This again is not the factual circumstance of this case. The other judicial decisions submitted by the Applicant concern the duties of fairness where visa officers carry out interviews with applicants, and are therefore of little assistance here.
