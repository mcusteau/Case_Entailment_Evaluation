  First, under the Regulations, the Applicant can benefit from 5 additional points if he establishes that his brother is a Canadian citizen living in Canada. Neither the Act nor the Regulations stipulate the method by which such a fact may be established. Consequently, the visa officers must decide these facts based on the documentation submitted to them by applicants. In this case, the Applicant argued that he submitted pertinent documentation, including a declaration from his brother received before a commissioner in Toronto, as well as Canadian and Indian passport documentation. The Applicant argued that such documentation must be presumed to be true. Yet the visa officer reviewing the matter declined to consider the brother's declaration on the basis that such a declaration was not sufficient proof of the brother actually living in Canada as per the May 15, 2008 notice sent to the Applicant indicating the type of information to supply with his application. This, it was argued, constitutes an unreasonable fettering of discretion.
