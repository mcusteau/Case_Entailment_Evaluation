  It should first be noted that this concerns a matter related to the weight to be given to evidence, and consequently legal principles related to the fettering of discretion may not apply at all. Presuming, without deciding, that even on evidentiary matters the visa officers may not fetter their discretion, the letter simply notifies applicants that they need to provide objective third party evidence of residence in Canada, and that self-serving affidavit evidence is not satisfactory for such purposes. The letter does not state that affidavits and statutory declarations will  
 never 
  be considered, simply that they are not deemed satisfactory proof. The letter does not close the possibility for an applicant to establish through other means the Canadian residency of a relative, nor does it necessarily imply that in special and unusual circumstances, an affidavit will not be considered sufficient.
