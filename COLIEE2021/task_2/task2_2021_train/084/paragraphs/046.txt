  The Applicant did file an affidavit with this Court submitted with the consent of the Respondent. This affidavit adds two documents which had not been previously submitted to the visa officer, specifically one page from a notice of assessment for the 2006 taxation year issued by the Canada Revenue Agency and bearing the name of his brother Deepak Malik, and a 2009 tax bill addressed to Deepak Malik by the Town of Richmond Hill. In this case, the notice of assessment document contains no address information and the municipal tax bill concerns a property which does not correspond to the address provided by the brother in his affidavit, but which does correspond to the address of his non-Canadian citizen mother as set out in the Certificate of registration as an overseas resident of India supplied for the brother.
