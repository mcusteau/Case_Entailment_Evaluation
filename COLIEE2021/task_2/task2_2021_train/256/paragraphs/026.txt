[26]
Subsection 9(1.2) of the
Act
requires that any person who makes an application for a visitor's visa shall satisfy a visa officer that the person is not an immigrant. This is a statutory presumption that a person making an application for a visitor's visa is an immigrant, and, of course would need an immigration visa.
