The applicant submits that subsection 9(1.2) of the
Immigration Act
does not entail that an intention to immigrate to Canada is a valid reason for refusing an application for a temporary visa, but rather, that an intention to remain in Canada illegally, after the expiration of a temporary visa, may be considered as a reason to refuse such an application. The applicant submits that, in considering the applicant's intent, a visa officer should only consider if the applicant has a valid temporary purpose in seeking to travel to Canada. [see footnote 2] Subsection 9(1.2) is valid legislation enacted by Parliament : it is
law
