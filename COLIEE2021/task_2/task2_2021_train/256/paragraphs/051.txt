The respondent submits that the Federal Appeal Court's decision in
Shah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1994), 170 N.R. 238 (F.C.A.) [see footnote 8] was not disturbed by
Baker
. In
Shah
, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the duty of fairness in such circumstances was minimal, and that an immigration officer was not required to put before an applicant any tentative conclusions she draws from the material before her, not even as to apparent contradictions which concern her. In
Baker
, (para. 32) the Supreme Court of Canada expressly disagreed with this minimal fairness assessment, and therefore the
Shah
decision is of limited utility here, but in
Baker
(para. 33) the Supreme Court held that procedural fairness does not necessarily require an oral hearing, for example
Said
[see footnote 9] at p. 30.
