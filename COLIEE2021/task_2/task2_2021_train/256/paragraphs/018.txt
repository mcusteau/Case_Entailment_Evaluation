The visa officer held that the applicant would not have access to the required funds because the applicant had not established that she was related to her sponsor. The visa officer stated in her affidavit that the certificate of relationship which was included in the application package did not give proof of how Mr. Chen was related to the applicant. This assertion is correct. The certificate included in the package states that Mr. Chen was related to her by way of being her "cousin", as is mentioned in paragraph 8 of Carole Courchesne's affidavit.
