A visa officer who considers an application for a student authorization is entitled to assess the applicant's long-term goals and may consider all relevant factors. In
Wong v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 246 N.R. 377; (F.C.A.) [see footnote 6], Mr. Justice LÃ©tourneau stated:
"[13] We firmly believe the visa officer is entitled, even at the moment of the first application for such visa, to examine the totality of the circumstances, including the long term goal of the applicant. Such goal is a relevant consideration, but not necessarily determinative, to be weighed with all the other facts and factors in determining whether or not an applicant is a visitor within the terms of the definition provided in the Act."
