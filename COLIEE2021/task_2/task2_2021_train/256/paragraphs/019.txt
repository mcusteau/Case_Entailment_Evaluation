Mr. Chen's ability to sponsor the applicant was well documented in her package, which included many documents which attested to his financial status. Therefore, the applicant submits that the documents pertaining to her parents' financial status were not included in the application package because they were not relevant to it. Moreover, such documents are not required of applications for student authorizations where the sponsors are relatives other than the applicant's parents.
