Subsection 9(1.2) of the
Immigration Act
provides that a person who makes an application for a visitor's visa shall satisfy a visa officer that the person is not an immigrant. This is a rebuttable presumption of law. In the absence of evidence to rebut the presumption that the visitor does not intend to establish permanent residence in Canada, a visitor is presumed to be an immigrant.
