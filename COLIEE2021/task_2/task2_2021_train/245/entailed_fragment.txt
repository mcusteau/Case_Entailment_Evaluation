The respondent's submission that the alleged breach of procedural fairness does not constitute an independent decision under review and that applicants should not be able to single out procedural violations when the final decision is reviewable on a reasonableness standard is without merit; it is irreconcilable with the fundamental principles of administrative law. The application of the reasonableness standard applies as a matter of substantive review, not when evaluating whether the decision-making process was fair.
