I find an analogy here with cases where failure to provide translation services at a hearing were raised in judicial review proceedings. If a litigant participates in a hearing without complaining that he or she cannot understand the language of the proceedings, that litigant cannot subsequently claim in judicial review proceedings a breach of procedural fairness resulting from a failure to provide translation services which were never requested:
