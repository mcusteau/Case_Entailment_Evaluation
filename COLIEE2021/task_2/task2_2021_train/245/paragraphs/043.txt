I need not decide between the different versions of events offered by the Applicant and the Respondent, since it is undisputed that the Applicant only complained once at the beginning of the hearing about her inability to follow the argument of opposing counsel, and that corrective measures were taken in response. If these measures were insufficient to allow the Applicant to adequately hear opposing counsel, it was incumbent on her to inform the adjudicator so as to allow him an opportunity to adequately address the concern. Having failed to do so, she cannot now raise the issue ex post facto in judicial review proceedings.
