[65]
For the reasons set out below, I conclude that the adjudicator was correct in staying the hearing of the complaint on the merits, but that he was wrong to decline jurisdiction in such a manner as to preclude the Canadian Human Rights Commission from referring the matter back to him under paragraph 41(1)(b) or paragraph 44(2)(b) of the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
