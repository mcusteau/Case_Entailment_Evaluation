The Applicant disputed this jurisdictional challenge on the basis that there was no allegation of discrimination in her
Canada Labour
Code
complaint and that this complaint "
can
be decided without determining whether discrimination took place" (Exhibit 6 of the affidavit of Wanda MacFarlane at page 50 of the Application record). The Applicant also submitted to the adjudicator the following particulars with respect to her
Canada Labour
Code
complaint (Exhibit 7 of the affidavit of Wanda MacFarlane at page 54 of the Application record):
"With regard to the particulars of my unjust dismissal claim, they are as follows:
My letter of dismissal stated four separate and distinct reasons for terminating my employment. [...]
It is my position that each an every one of these allegations is unfounded. Further, it is my position that, even if any and all of these allegations were judged on a balance of probabilities to be true, my dismissal would still be found to be unjust because Day & Ross failed to apply progressive discipline."
