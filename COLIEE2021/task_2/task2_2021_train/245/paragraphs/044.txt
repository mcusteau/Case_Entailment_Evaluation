The key fact here is that the Applicant did not follow up on her complaint by informing the adjudicator that the corrective measures taken were insufficient or by requesting that the hearing be moved to another more adequate location. Rather, the Applicant remained silent on the issue throughout the remainder of the hearing, and in fact actively participated in the hearing. She only raised this issue anew in these judicial review proceedings, long after the hearing had ended and after she had received the decision of the adjudicator.
