[73]
Consequently, an adjudicator appointed under subsection 242(1) of the
Canada Labour
Code
must decline to hear a complaint filed under subsection 240(1) of that
Code
if another substantially similar complaint has been filed under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
or, in the event that no complaint has been submitted under that
Act
, if the
Canada Labour
Code
complaint raises human rights issues which could reasonably constitute a basis for a substantially similar complaint under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
.
