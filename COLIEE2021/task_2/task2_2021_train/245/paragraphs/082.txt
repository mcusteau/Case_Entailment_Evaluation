In my view, the absence of a statutory provision in the
Canada Labour
Code
explicitly conferring on an adjudicator the power to interpret and apply human rights statutes or any other statute does not negate the adjudicator's authority to do so. This power is rather implicitly provided for in paragraph 242(3)(a) of the
Canada Labour Code
: it gives the adjudicator the authority to consider whether the dismissal was "unjust", and empowers the adjudicator to render a binding decision on this matter.
