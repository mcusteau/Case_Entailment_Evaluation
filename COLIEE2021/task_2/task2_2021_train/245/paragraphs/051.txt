[51]
Pursuant to paragraph 242(2)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
reproduced above, the adjudicator had the authority to determine the procedure to be followed in this case, including the authority to order a bifurcation of the proceedings. Though the Respondent would have preferred to have their jurisdictional objection decided on a written record rather than at a hearing, the adjudicator decided otherwise. The hearing which was held was to deal first with the jurisdictional issues raised by the Respondent and the resulting potential bifurcation of the proceedings. The Applicant was notified in writing prior to the hearing that these issues would be dealt with at the hearing. The Applicant was also provided with an opportunity to offer evidence and to make representations on the preliminary issues, and she availed herself of this opportunity. Consequently, the Applicant's contention that her right to a fair hearing was denied cannot be accepted.
