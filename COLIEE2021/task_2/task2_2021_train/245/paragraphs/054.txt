[54]
In this case, the adjudicator identified the issue to be decided, namely whether the complaint submitted under the
Canadian Human Rights
Act
deprived him of the jurisdiction to hear the complaint pursuant to paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
. The adjudicator also determined that the intent of paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
is to avoid the multiplicity of proceedings arising from the same set of facts; consequently, he identified the principal issue of fact raised by the proceedings, namely whether both complaints were essentially similar. The adjudicator took into consideration the submission of the Applicant that each complaint related to different matters, but he ruled otherwise. The adjudicator cogently explained in his decision why he so ruled. The adjudicator then examined the case law and, on the basis of his analysis, ruled that he did not have jurisdiction to hear the matter.
