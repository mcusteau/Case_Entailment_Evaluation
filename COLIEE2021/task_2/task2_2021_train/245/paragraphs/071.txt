Indeed, in adopting paragraph 242(3.1)(b) of the
Canada Labour
Code
, Parliament intended to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings in the context of an unfair dismissal. The use of the imperative "shall" in paragraph 242(3.1)(b) is a clear indication that an adjudicator appointed under subsection 241(1) of the
Canada Labour
Code
must refuse to hear the complaint where another procedure for redress has been provided for elsewhere in that
Code
or in another Act of Parliament.
