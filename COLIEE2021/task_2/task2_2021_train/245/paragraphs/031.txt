As a general rule, issues involving principles of natural justice or turning on procedural fairness are to be reviewed on the basis of a correctness standard:
Khosa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 339; 385 N.R. 206; 2009 SCC 12 at para. 43. As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Sketchley v. Canada (Attorney General)

CUPE
[
C.U.P.E. v. Ontario (Minister of Labour)
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 539, 2003 SCC 29] directs a court, when reviewing a decision challenged on the grounds of procedural fairness, to isolate any act or omission relevant to procedural fairness (at para. 100). This procedural fairness element is reviewed as a question of law. No deference is due. The decision-maker has either complied with the content of the duty of fairness appropriate for the particular circumstances, or has breached this duty."
