He answered these questions as follows at paragraphs 19 to 21 of his decision:
"19. In the matter before me, despite the contention of the complainant, I have no hesitation concluding that the complaint before me is essentially the same as the complaint she filed with the CHRC. In my view, although the complaint she filed with the CHRC is more detailed, one need look no farther than her own words found in the second last paragraph. These words are set forth above in paragraph 8. She clearly and without equivocation claims that her termination amounted to discrimination on the basis of disability. Therefore, I have no alternative but to conclude that complaint (sic) before the CHRC is essentially the same as that before me. This is especially so when one considers the fact the complainant submits that the 'errors' that lead to her dismissal were as a result of her disability.
"20. With respect to the remedial power under the
CHRA
, I agree with [t]he analysis of adjudicator Cooper in
Duncan
, [[2000] C.L.A.D. No. 588]. In that case, at paragraph 17, the learned adjudicator identifies some of the broad remedies available under the
CHRA
. Although they are not necessarily the same as those available under the
Code
, one would be hard pressed to categorize them as other than 'real redress which could be of personal benefit to the same complainant.'
"21. For all of the reasons above I have no hesitation in concluding that I am statute barred from hearing this matter."
