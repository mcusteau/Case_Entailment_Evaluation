[49]
The Applicant was clearly provided with an opportunity to respond to, and submit arguments on, the jurisdictional issues raised by the Respondent and the request for bifurcation that ensued: affidavit of Wanda MacFarlane at paragraphs 35 to 39; affidavit of Eric Rowley at paragraphs 51 to 61. Moreover, the Applicant has failed to identify in her written and oral submissions a single argument that she has not been able to plead with respect to the request for bifurcation; she merely proffered generalities concerning the process.
