The hearing of this case occurred in Toronto on October 30, 1989. The Court called upon the counsel on each side to provide further argument in writing, on a schedule terminating on or about December 5, 1989, with which counsel faithfully complied. But, by that time it appeared that the Appeal Division's adjudication of the Crown's appeal in The Queen and the M.E.I. v. The Canadian Council of Churches, A-223-89, would probably shed light on the question of standing faced by the applicant herein, and that the Appeal Division ought to be tracked if its decision appeared to be reasonably imminent. The Appeal Division heard the case in January, 1989, and its unanimous judgment was rendered by Mr. Justice MacGuigan on March 12, 1990, the beginning of a long, inopportune period for the formulation of this Court's reasons in this case at bar.
