Exhibit "C" to Janet Rowsell's affidavit filed for the applicant, is a "copy of an excerpt from the Canadian House of Commons, Parliamentary Debates of June 10th, 1952, including the statement of the Honourable W.E. Harris, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration upon moving a [sic] second reading of Bill No. 305, an Act Respecting Immigration". In Elmer A. Driedger's well respected work, The Construction of Statutes, Butterworths, Toronto, Chapter 8, "External Context", it is stated at page 130: "It is well established that parliamentary debates are not admissible to show Parliamentary intent", followed by a footnote of weighty authorities. The statement of the Hon. Walter E. Harris recorded in the Commons' Hansard, even if admissible to record his understanding and intent on that day, does not, and nor does the applicant, say anything of the debates in the Senate, that other multi-member organ of Canada's bicameral legislature, nor whether Bill No. 305 was ever amended before being enacted.
