Alas, the applicant cannot have the remedies which he so justly seeks. In Singh et al. v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 177; 58 N.R. 1; 17 D.L.R.(4th) 422; 14 C.R.R. 13; 12 Admin. L.R. 137, at pp. 201-202 S.C.R., Madam Justice Wilson, writing for one of the two equal divisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in that case, considered the application of the Charter, and came to this conclusion:
"Counsel for the Minister concedes that 'everyone' is sufficiently broad to include the appellants in its compass and I am prepared to accept that the term
includes every human being who is physically present in Canada
and by virtue of such presence amenable to Canadian law." (emphasis not in original text)
Here is the point of guidance taken up, no doubt, by MacGuigan, J.A., in the Council of Churches case wherein, in regard to certain matters pleaded in the statement of claim, he is reported (N.R. p. 77) as holding:
"... This [pleading] could found a right of standing, but cannot constitute a reasonable cause of action since the claimants affected would all be non-citizens outside Canada with no claim to admission, and therefore beyond the scope of the Charter."
