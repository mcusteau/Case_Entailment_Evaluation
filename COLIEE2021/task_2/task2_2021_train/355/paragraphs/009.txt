Another notable aspect of s. 19(2) (a), at least in regard to the applicant's obviously earnest submissions, is that it does not mention a "crime" or "moral turpitude" at all, despite its exceptional reference to "persons who have satisfied the Minister that they have rehabilitated themselves". It ought to be mighty easy to give such satisfaction after a once-in-a-lifetime conviction of driving with excessively alcoholic breath, blood or urine. Nevertheless, instead of "crime" or "moral turpitude", the Act refers only to "an offence ... under another Act of Parliament", which expression covers a great multitude of not only mala prohibita, but also of course mala in se, the "real" crimes. All crimes are offences, but not all offences are crimes; and Parliament simply avoided any distinction by adopting the broader expression "offence" in s. 19(2)(a) of the Act.
