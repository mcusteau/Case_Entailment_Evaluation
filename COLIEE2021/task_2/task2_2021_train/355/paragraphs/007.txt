The applicant had to pay the fine and undergo the year's disqualification from driving, both comprising his sentence, upon conviction for the following offence:
"... you did drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place after consuming so much alcohol that the proportion thereof in your breath exceeded the prescribed limit.
"Contrary to s. 6 and Schedule 4 to the Road Traffic Act, 1972 as substituted by s. 25 and Schedule 8 to the Transport Act, 1981." (applicant's exhibit "D")
The second above-cited statute provides in its s. 25(3):
"(3) For sections 6 to 12 of the 1972 Act there are substituted the sections set out in Schedule 8."
The new s. 6 refers to the proportion of alcohol in a person's "breath, blood, or urine" as did the former section. It is provided in the Transportation Act, 1981 mentioned in the charge above recited. The "prescribed limit" is set out in Schedule 8, subs. 12(1), to mean:
"... as the case may require
(a) 35 microgrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath;
(b) 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood; or
(c) 107 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of urine;
or such other proportion as may be prescribed by regulations made by the Secretary of State."
No such regulations which might have been in force in January, 1988, were brought to the Court's attention. Each stated proportion of alcohol is the equivalent of the other two. It is necessary only to note that s. 17 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, exacts that judicial notice be taken of all Acts of the Imperial Parliament. Accordingly the Court must taken judicial notice of the "debt to society" which persons in the U.K. must pay for the commission of the above defined offence and of the ingredients of the offence.
