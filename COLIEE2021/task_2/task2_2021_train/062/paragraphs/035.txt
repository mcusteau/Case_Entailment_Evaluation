 [35] 
  With respect to the merits of the appeal, the respondent submits that the RAD reasonably rejected the new evidence in accordance with the RAD Rules which require the appellant to indicate how the new evidence relates to his appeal and in accordance with subsection 110(4). It was also reasonable for the RAD to consider the test in  
 Raza, 
  although it dealt with the application of section 113 of the Act, given the analogous wording of subsection 110(4).
