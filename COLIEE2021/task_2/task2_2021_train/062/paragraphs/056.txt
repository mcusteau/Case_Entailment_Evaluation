 [56] 
  I agree with the applicant that the  
 Raza 
  test should not automatically apply to a determination under subsection 110(4). The  
 Raza 
  test or factors, which include consideration of credibility, relevance, newness  
 and 
  materiality, are not necessarily applicable to subsection 110(4) which governs whether new evidence is admissible in the context of an appeal as opposed to a PRRA. In  
 Singh 
 , at para 57, Justice Gagn√© noted that the context is an important distinguishing factor and that it should not be assumed that the  
 Raza f 
 actors govern subsection 110(4) determinations regarding the admissibility of new evidence.
