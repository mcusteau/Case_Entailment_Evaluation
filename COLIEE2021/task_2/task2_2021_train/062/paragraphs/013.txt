 Newton v Criminal Trial Lawyers' Association 
 , 2010 ABCA 399 at para 44, [2011] 4 WWR 232, and the differences between the RPD, a tribunal of first instance, and the RAD, which was created to review the decisions made by the RPD on questions of law, fact or mixed fact and law, with the ability to substitute a different determination where appropriate. The RAD noted that the RPD is, in most cases, in the best position to assess credibility and to make findings on issues of law, fact or mixed fact and law and concluded that it should apply the standard of reasonableness to these aspects of the RPD's decision.
