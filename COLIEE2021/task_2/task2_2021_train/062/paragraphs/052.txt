  As noted above, it is not an error for the RAD to defer to findings with respect to credibility, where the RAD conducts a sufficiently independent analysis of those findings. In the present case, the RAD analyzed the evidence on the record to conclude that the specific credibility findings were not supported and, in fact, were contradicted. The RAD, therefore, found that the credibility findings were not reasonable. The RAD would have logically reached the same finding - that the credibility findings were flawed - if it had applied a less deferential standard of review.
