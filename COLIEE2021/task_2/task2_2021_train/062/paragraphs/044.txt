  Justice Gagné reached the contrary conclusion, also after conducting a comprehensive analysis, in  
 Akuffo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 1063 at paras 17-26, [2014] FCJ No 1116 [ 
 Akuffo 
 ]. Justice Gagné found that this Court should apply the reasonableness standard to the review of decisions of the RAD on its choice of the standard of review, noting that reasonableness is the presumptive standard and that there are no other circumstances to justify departing from the presumptive standard. Justice Martineau reached the same conclusion following his analysis in  
 Djossou v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 1080 at paras 13-37, [2014] FCJ No 1130 [ 
 Djossou 
 ].
