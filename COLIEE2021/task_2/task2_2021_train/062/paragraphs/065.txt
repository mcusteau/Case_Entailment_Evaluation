 [65] 
  As noted above, the RAD should assume its appellate role rather than adopt judicial review principles. In the present case, the RAD adopted a judicial review approach and the reasonableness standard of review and confirmed the determinative findings of the RPD, while at the same time considering a wider range of issues, as would be appropriate on a full fact based appeal. However, the RAD did not consider whether it had the discretion to raise a new issue, whether it should exercise any such discretion or whether this would engage issues of procedural fairness.
