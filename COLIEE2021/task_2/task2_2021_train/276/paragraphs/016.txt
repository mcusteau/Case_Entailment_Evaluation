Mr. Justice Gibson, in
Kulendrarajah et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2004), 245 F.T.R. 145; 2004 FC 79, determined that the board did not err in arriving at its negative credibility finding. Since the sole bases for the claim were Convention grounds (ethnicity and membership in a particular social group), the board's credibility and risk analyses were sufficient to support a denial of refugee status. Justice Gibson further determined that the claimant was not a person in need of protection because no ground to support a need of protection other than a Convention ground had been advanced. While a more extensive explanation for the board's determination regarding s. 97 might have been desirable, its absence did not constitute reviewable error.
