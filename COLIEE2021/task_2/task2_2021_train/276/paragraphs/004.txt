The first alleged error is that the RPD erred by failing to consider the "compelling reasons" exception under s. 108 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (
IRPA
). The gist of this argument is that the RPD found, in the same decision, that because Mrs. Brovina's son and daughter-in-law were accepted as refugees, they would not be going back to Albania and the reason for which Mrs. Brovina was persecuted in Albania would therefore no longer exist. Since the reasons for which Mrs. Brovina left Albania had ceased to exist - because of the board's own decision - it should have determined whether there are compelling reasons that she should not be returned to Albania.
