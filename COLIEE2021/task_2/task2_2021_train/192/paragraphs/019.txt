  Mr. Justice NoÃ«l in  
 Dumbrava 
 , however, came to the opposite conclusion. He stated at p. 88: 
 
 
 
 "I would have thought that the matter could best be approached the other way in that, absent an express grant of jurisdiction, it is doubtful that a decision maker has the power to reconsider a prior decision on new grounds and exercise his or her discretion anew. The decision making powers of a visa officer are statutory and, as such, they must be found in the statute. While I have no doubt that slips, typos and obvious errors can be corrected after a decision has been rendered the discretion of a decision maker is, in my view, fully exhausted once the discretionary authority to decide has been exercised in the manner contemplated by statute. As such a decision maker cannot pronounce more than once on the same matter."
