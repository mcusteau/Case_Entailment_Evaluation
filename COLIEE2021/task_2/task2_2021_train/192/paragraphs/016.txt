  There is no doubt that the jurisprudence in this area is unsettled. One aspect that is clear, however, is that a decision, such as that undertaken in this case is a new decision subject to judicial review. The validity of the decision depends on whether the decision-maker has authority to undertake the reconsideration. This was held to be the case by Mr. Justice Rothstein in  
 Soimu v. Canada (Secretary of State) 
  (1994), 83 F.T.R. 285, and by Mr. Justice NoÃ«l in  
 Dumbrava v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1995), 101 F.T.R. 230; 31 Imm. L.R.(2d) 76.
