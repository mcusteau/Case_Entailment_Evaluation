  As noted, the  
 Chandler 
  decision states that the principle of functus officio should be applied flexibly in the case of administrative decisions since justice may require the reopening of those decisions. I am persuaded that Parliament's silence in the case of applications for landing, when the individual has been found eligible for such because he falls under DROC, was not intended to restrict the immigration officer from reopening a file when the officer considers it in the interests of justice to do so.
