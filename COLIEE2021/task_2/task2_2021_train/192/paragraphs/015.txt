  Mr. Justice Cullen's conclusion accords with the statement contained in paragraph 13.322.1 of Mr. Waldman's looseleaf publication,  
 Immigration Law and Practice 
  (Toronto: Butterworths Canada): 
 
 
 
 "If an application is refused, either counsel or the applicant have several options. They can seek clarification on the reasons for refusal, either by approaching the visa officer or by making a request under the  
 Access to Information Act 
  for the visa officer's file. In either case, after being apprised of the reasons for refusal, the applicant can seek a reconsideration by submitting further documentation in support of the application in order to address the concerns raised by the visa officer."
