A second argument relates to whether the applicants were given sufficient details of the allegations against them in order to make meaningful responses. This raises a very difficult problem where the information originates from informers whose identity must be protected. The difficulty is made even greater when, as in this case, what is alleged is a conspiracy to commit a crime in the future. Here, details as to the proposed prison breach were provided. However, the real issue is whether there was indeed a conspiracy and whether the applicants were involved. Whether additional information about the conspiracy could have been provided without disclosing the identity of informants, I am unable to say. During argument it was suggested by counsel for the applicants that all the information upon which the decisions were based should be reviewed by the court to see what more could have been given to the applicants. In an appropriate case there might be merit to such an approach. In view of my disposition of this matter it is not necessary in this case.
