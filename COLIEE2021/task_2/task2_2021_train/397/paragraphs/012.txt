In
Chaves v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
), [2005] FC 193, [2005] F.C.J. No. 232 (QL), at para. 11, I applied the pragmatic and functional approach and concluded that, given the nature of the question, as one of mixed fact and law, and the relative expertise of this Court in determining whether a legal standard has been met, the appropriate standard of review applicable to determinations of state protection is one of reasonableness
simpliciter
. Accordingly, the Board's decision will stand "if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling" (
Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, at para. 55).
