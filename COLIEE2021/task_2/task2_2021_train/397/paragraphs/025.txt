As Layden-Stevenson J. indicated in
Castillo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2004 FC 56, [2004] F.C.J. No. 43 (QL), at para. 9:
The question of effective state protection was identified as the central issue. Where evidence that relates to a central issue is submitted, the burden of explanation increases for the board when it assigns little or no weight to that evidence or when it prefers specific documentary evidence over other documentary evidence.
Thus, in the context of the central issue of state protection, the Board is required to explain its preference for certain documentary evidence over other relevant sources.
