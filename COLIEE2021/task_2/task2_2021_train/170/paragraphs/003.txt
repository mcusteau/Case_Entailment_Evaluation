 [3] 
  At the request of the appellant, on October 13, 1993, the Registrar of Trademarks issued to the respondent a notice pursuant to s. 45(1) of the  
 Act 
 . Pursuant to the section as it read at that time, the respondent was required to establish that the trademark had been used in Canada at any time during the two year period immediately preceding the date of the s. 45 notice. That period was therefore from October 13, 1991 through October 13, 1993.
