  In s. 45 proceedings, the Registrar will not consider any evidence other than that put forth by or on behalf of the registered owner of the trademark. The requesting party is not permitted to cross-examine on any affidavit filed by the registered owner. Similarly, on appeal to the Federal Court, the requesting party is not entitled to file evidence. The registered owner is entitled to adduce further evidence and the requesting party is not permitted to cross-examine on any further affidavit filed by the registered owner. As such, the requesting party has no means by which to submit evidence before the court or to test the veracity of the registered owner's evidence [see footnote 3].
