  The applicants allege that the Officer erred in assessing the degree of establishment and integration of their family into Canadian society. They argue that the Officer should not have considered whether their level of establishment was exceptional, but whether being uprooted from Canada would cause excessive hardship. The applicants restate certain points demonstrated by the evidence, namely that they have nothing to return to in Kenya, they have friends, relatives and associates in Canada, a strong community, employment and courses of education. The applicants further submit that they meet all five criteria proposed in the Inland Processing Manual Chapter 5,  
 Immigrant Applications made in Canada on Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds 
 , at paragraph 11.2, used to evaluate the degree of establishment: 
 
 
 
 The degree of the applicant's establishment in Canada may include such questions as: 
 
 
 
 • Does the applicant have a history of stable employment? 
 
 • Is there a pattern of sound financial management? 
 
 • Has the applicant integrated into the community through involvement in community organizations, voluntary services or other activities? 
 
 • Has the applicant undertaken any professional, linguistic or other study that show integration into Canadian society? 
 
 • Do the applicant and family members have a good civil record in Canada (e.g., no interventions by police or other authorities for child or spouse abuse, criminal charges)?
