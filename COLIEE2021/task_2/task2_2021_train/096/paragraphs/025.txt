 [25] 
  The reasons provided by the Officer are justified, and intelligible. It was reasonably open to the Officer to conclude that any difficulties arising from the applicants' South Asian ethnicity in Kenya would not amount to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship. It is not the role of this Court to reweigh the evidence that was before the decision maker. Though the applicants may not agree with the outcome of the decision, it falls within the range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the evidence he had before him.
