  However, the first issue in the case at bar is a question of law, which in the context of the review of H&C decisions, this Court has found to be reviewable on a standard of correctness ( 
 Mackiozy v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 1106 at paragraph 9, [2007] F.C.J. No. 1428;  
 El Doukhi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2006 FC 1464, at paragraph 11, [2006] F.C.J. No. 1843;  
 Mooker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FC 779, at paragraph 16, [2007] F.C.J. No. 1029). It is my opinion that the standard of correctness should continue to be applied when determining if the correct test was applied with respect to the risk assessment portion of an H&C decision ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , at paragraphs 55, 57, 62, and 64). 
 
 
 
 Did the Officer err in applying an incorrect test in the risk assessment portion of the H&C decision?
