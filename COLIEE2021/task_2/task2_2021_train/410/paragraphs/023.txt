In that case, Mr. Justice Walsh held that a change in the
Regulations
governing residency requirements could not be invoked where the original nomination of persons to be admitted was made pursuant to a former provision. He relied in part on the case of
Nepean (Township) v. Leikin
, [1971] 1 O.R. 567 (Ont. C.A.), to hold that no retroactive application of regulations may be used to impair rights or obligations already accrued, unless the regulations explicitly allow it. I agree with that finding. Therefore, the question becomes whether the applicant's
right to landed status
had accrued, prior to the change in the governing legislation.
