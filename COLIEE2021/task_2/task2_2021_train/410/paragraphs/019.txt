This case differs from some of the existing jurisprudence of this Court cited by the applicant and the respondent in that there was no Order-in-Council made, as none was required. On this point alone, this case can be distinguished from the case of
Dass v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1993), 59 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.), which was relied upon by the applicant. We are also dealing here with the transition provisions for a new legislation, as opposed to some change in the applicant's circumstances. Thus, the question would appear to become whether the change in legislation, combined with Immigration's delay in processing the application, should be used to deny the applicant something he would otherwise be entitled to receive.
