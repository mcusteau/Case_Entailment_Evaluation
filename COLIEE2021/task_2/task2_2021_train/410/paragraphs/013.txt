The applicant submits that if the court accepts this assertion, then the law as it stood prior to Bill C-86, does not prevent him from being granted residence by virtue of his summary conviction (relying on
Lee v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1980] 1 F.C. 374; 30 N.R. 575 (F.C.A.)). He argues that since his application had been submitted for processing prior to the change, such change cannot be applied to his detriment. On this point he relies, in part, upon s. 43 of the
Interpretation Act
and the case of
McDoom v. Minister of Manpower and Immigration
, [1978] 1 F.C. 323 (F.C.T.D.). Similarly, he argues that he had completed all necessary steps for his application to be allowed prior to the amendment date and therefore, since his right to residence had already accrued, the change in the law cannot be applied retroactively to revoke this right, absent explicit provisions to that effect.
