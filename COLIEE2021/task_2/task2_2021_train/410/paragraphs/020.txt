The first issue, however, is the factual one of the delivery date of the final document requested. The applicant can offer no proof that he delivered the document on the date he claims. Similarly, the respondent has no more proof than a date stamp, and its own representative who admits that said stamp could be inaccurate, and that the morning, when the applicant states he delivered the document, is always a very busy part of the day. Thus, there is no good indication who is correct, but given the actions of the applicant, it appears reasonable to assume that he acted swiftly in delivering the documents as he swears he did. This would be consistent with his behaviour in requesting the forms as soon as he was notified they were required, telling the police of the urgency of his request and picking them up as soon as they were ready. I see no reason to believe that he would have delayed until the following week to deliver the documents, particularly with his status as a resident hanging in the balance. Thus, I accept that he did indeed deliver the requested documentation in a timely manner, and prior to February 1, 1993.
