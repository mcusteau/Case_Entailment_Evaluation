The hearing of the plaintiff's complaint took place before Mr. Jean Benoît on November 24, 1987. In early 1989 he concluded that the nonrenewal of the plaintiff's contract in 1985 was not consistent with the departmental policy that an employee who had held the same position for five years of continuous service would become a permanent employee. He indicated that a strike in a neighbouring abattoir was not a sufficient reason for departing from that policy. As to the refusal to renew the plaintiff's term in 1987, the investigator dismissed the plaintiff's complaint. After rendering his decision, Mr. Benoît recommended that the Department undertake a conciliation process with the plaintiff.
