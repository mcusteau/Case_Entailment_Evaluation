In any case, the circumstances of this situation do not support a legitimate expectation. First, the promise that he would be made permanent to which the plaintiff refers was made to him by Mr. Leblanc, his immediate superior. This individual did not have the necessary authority to make such a promise. Only Dr. Guy Meilleur had the power to staff or create positions. Second, the Department was compelled not to apply the administrative policy for valid reasons. The staff reduction and the proposed cut of 11.75 person-years radically affected the Department's requirements. Their priority was to protect permanent employees who had become vulnerable. It is quite logical for term employees to be the first ones affected by staff reductions and cuts. Further, the fact that the austerity measures only took effect six months after the decision challenged by the plaintiff does not in any way affect the validity of the Department's action. It was essential for the Department, in performing the administrative duties incumbent on it, to take the necessary steps to deal with the eventual and inevitable reduction in its staff.
