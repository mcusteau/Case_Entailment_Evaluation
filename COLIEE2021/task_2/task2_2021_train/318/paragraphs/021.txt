The plaintiff's position is based on failure to comply with the Treasury Board's administrative policy. The question that arises before any conclusion of law can be reached is as to the effect of that policy on the rules of administrative law. First, the plaintiff submitted that the policy should be considered in the same way as a regulation. Once a legislature authorizes an administrative tribunal to draft its regulations and adopt policies, they have the force of law and failure to comply with them is subject to judicial review. In other words, the Department had the duty of appointing the plaintiff to a full-time position and its refusal was illegal.
