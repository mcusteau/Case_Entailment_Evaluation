In view of this case law, since the remedy sought clearly involves a fundamental right this court cannot allow the application. Even if I were to allow the procedural remedy, that is, if I were to conclude that the plaintiff had a right to be consulted before the decision not to renew his contract was taken, that remedy does not meet the demands of the case since I am persuaded that the decision taken could not be altered.
