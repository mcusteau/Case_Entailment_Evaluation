On December 18, 1985, Mr. Leblanc informed the plaintiff that his contract would not be renewed as of December 31, 1985, and he was then given a letter on December 19 confirming that his employment would terminate on December 31, 1985, due to departmental constraints. The plaintiff's employment accordingly terminated after four years, eleven months and two weeks. It should be noted that Miss Drouin, who held a similar position with the Vall√©e-Jonction abattoir, was simultaneously informed that her contract would not be renewed as of December 31, 1985.
