The plaintiff's term was subsequently renewed for consecutive periods of one year in 1982 and 1983. In 1983 his position was also reclassified to the PI-02 level. In 1984 the plaintiff's term was renewed to March 29, 1985, and his position was allocated to Saint-Henri. After two months he was summoned to Qu√©bec where Mr. Joncas, his superior, asked him to return to the Saint-Charles abattoir to replace Mr. Marcotte who was on sick leave and was shortly to retire. The plaintiff therefore replaced Mr. Marcotte temporarily and subsequently returned to his own position in Saint-Charles.
