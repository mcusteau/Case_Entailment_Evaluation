The same principle of legitimate expectation was further explained by Sopinka, J., of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Old St. Boniface Residents v. Winnipeg (City of)
, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1170; 116 N.R. 46; 69 Man.R.(2d) 134; 75 D.L.R.(4th) 385, at p. 1204 S.C.R.:
"The principle developed in these cases is simply an extension of the rules of natural justice and procedural fairness. It affords a party affected by the decision of a public official an opportunity to make representations in circumstances in which there otherwise would be no such opportunity. The court supplies the omission where, based on the conduct of the public official, a party has been led to believe that his or her rights would not be affected without consultation."
