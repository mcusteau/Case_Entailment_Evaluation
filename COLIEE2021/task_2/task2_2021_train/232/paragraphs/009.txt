By letter dated March 1, 1988, the following written reasons were given for the denial of the permanent residence application:
"This concerns your application for permanent residence in Canada.
"With your application you submitted a proposed business plan. The plan states that your objective is to establish a business in Canada, on a self-employed basis, as a teacher of the theory and practice of violin and viola music. However, according to your application, you have never been a self-employed music teacher. During your interview at this office on 23 February 1988, it was confirmed that you have no self-employed experience as a music teacher.
"Subsection 11(1) of Canada's Immigration Regulations, 1978, states that:
'... a visa officer shall not issue an immigrant visa pursuant to section 9 or 10 to an immigrant who is assessed on the basis of factors listed in column I of Schedule I and is not awarded any units of assessment for the factor set out in item 3 thereof (i.e. experience).'
"Since you do not have at least one year of experience in your intended occupation, I regret that I am unable to issue an immigrant visa to you pursuant to subsection 11(1) of the Regulations.
"Recently the Canada Employment and Immigration Commission in Toronto informed us that applicants seeking to establish as music teachers in the Ontario region must be experienced in order to develop a clientele without difficulty. Based on that information, I must also inform you that your application has been refused since, in my opinion, you will not be able to become successfully established in your proposed occupation or business in Canada. Consequently, in assessing your case, I did not award you the 30 units of assessment provided for in regulation 8(4). Therefore, you fail to receive the minimum number of assessment units (70) required under subparagraph 9(b)(i) of the Regulations."
