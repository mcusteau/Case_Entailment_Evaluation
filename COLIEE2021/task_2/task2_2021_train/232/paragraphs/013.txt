The language and structure of the message clearly distinguishes between self-employed musician applicants and music teaching applicants, separating the two into different paragraphs and referring to each in particular. Furthermore, it states that experienced candidates wishing to teach music have good opportunities in Toronto if they are fluent in English. Obviously, this implies that any influx of these people will not adversely affect the Canadian labour market. Yet, it is clear that the international recognition factor is applied by CEIC because of the expected negative impact of self-employed musicians on the labour market. I have difficulty with an interpretation of the telex which applies international recognition criteria to music teaching applicants in an effort to keep them out based on possible negative effects on the job market, when the same telex goes on to specify that if music teachers have experience and adequate English, there are good opportunities for work. In any event, I think there is a more substantial basis for granting the relief sought.
