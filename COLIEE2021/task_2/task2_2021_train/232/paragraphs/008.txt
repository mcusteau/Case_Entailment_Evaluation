During the interview, the officer made the following notes on the Immigrant Assessment Record:
"The applicant does not meet CEIC Toronto's guidelines for likely successful establishment as SE 2 (self-employed): He is not internationally recognized and although he has worked as a teaching assistant (like most grad. students do) he has no self-employed experience as a music teacher. Discussed with AN (Albert Nauman, officer-in-charge) and he concurs with the refusal (despite the quality of these applicants)."
