The letter of refusal indicates that the application for permanent residence was denied on the basis that the applicant lacked at least one year of self-employed experience in his intended occupation of self-employed music teacher, and without such experience successful establishment in Canada was not considered possible. Counsel for the applicant submitted in argument that this is an erroneous interpretation of the legislation, since neither the Act nor the Regulations make any requirement that self-employed applicants have self-employed experience. The respondents replied that as the Act and Regulations require assessment of the applicant's experience in his intended occupation, here stated to be "self-employed music teacher" the criterion of assessment becomes whether the applicant has any self-employed experience as music teacher.
