The standard of review of the adjudicator's decision is no less than reasonableness. I find that the adjudicator took a remarkably generous view of the evidence before him. I think it unlikely that he has been or will ever be employed as a credit manager. But I am reluctant to say that his conclusions were unreasonable. My reluctance springs from the fact that it is difficult to think about persons in the situation of these respondents as individuals. The position taken by the Minister, if accepted, would ensure than none of these waterborne visitors would ever be seriously considered for release from detention. The fact that these individuals arrived as part of a group conditions us to think that they had a common purpose, which is to be determined by considering which factors are common to the group. But the decisions affecting these individuals must be made on the basis of their individual positions. So I am reluctant to say that the adjudicator who saw them and heard them was unreasonable when he gave effect to evidence in a way which reflected an individualized view of the respondents. In these cases, it is too easy to conclude that a decision is unreasonable simply because it found for the respondents. That said, there comes a point at which generosity of spirit becomes wishful thinking. This adjudicator was in the general vicinity of that point.
