Following this conclusion, the Minister's representatives made representations as to the amounts of the security deposits, suggesting that they should be in some proportion to the amount of the debt to the snakeheads and said that he wished to cross-examine the persons posting the security deposit (" the sureties"). Counsel for the respondents made submissions to the effect that each respondent had a brother in the U.S. who would provide the funds to post the security deposit. It was noted that Zu Fa Zhang did not in fact know the name of his mother's cousin and didn't have her phone number in Toronto but he had the number of a friend. The adjudicator then dealt with these issues:
"Minister's counsel suggested that he wished an opportunity to cross-examine the bondspersons. Pursuant to the
Immigration Act
, I have the authority to determine procedures in here. Of course in accordance with the rules of natural justice, etc. Mr. Starr was given the opportunity in his reply to address such matters. That is the core to making my decision. He chose not to do that. His suggestion to cross-examine was after my decision had been rendered. That is clearly not the correct place conduct cross-examination. In any case, I was satisfied without delving into the inushi [minutiae?] of the backgrounds of the bondspersons etc. that these two individuals are likely to report. Apart from establishing very close links to bondspersons etc.,in my view these are credible individuals. Who are more likely than not are going to live up to their obligations. Today I do not hinge on the relationship to bondspeople. There would be no point in examining the bondspersons. It has been pointed out to me that the funds will be coming from relatives and I accept that. ... Any person may post the bond in favour of these individuals."
