This leads to the question as to how this is to be done to avoid the situation which developed in the course of this hearing. It is for the Adjudication Division to devise its own procedures. This court can only comment on onus. In a detention review, the onus of justifying detention is on the Minister. See
Sahin v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1995] 1 F.C. 214; 85 F.T.R. 99 (T.D.). However, as a practical matter, the Minister is not in the position to carry the onus as to the acceptability of the surety since that person can only be proposed by the detainee. The onus is therefore on the detainee to satisfy the adjudicator that the proposed surety is acceptable. If counsel for the detainees gives the Minister's representative sufficient notice of the name of the proposed surety and their relationship to the detainees, then much of the work can be done informally. If the Minister's representative objects to the proposed bondsperson, then counsel for the detainees can choose to lead evidence as to their suitability at which time the Minister's representative will have the opportunity to lead the Minister's evidence. It is at this point that the question of the cross-examination of the proposed surety should arise.
