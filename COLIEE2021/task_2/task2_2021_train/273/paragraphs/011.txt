[11]
The following passages are important enough to be quoted verbatim:
"It is in fact not the only thing you can do [going underground in the U.S.] and my view is that because both of you are likely to report as required I will give you that opportunity. In both cases I have been convinced that neither of you fit into a general profile into which it was invited that you did belong. In both cases you have places to go and people to support you. In both cases homes have been offered. And in my view acceptance of the bonds is acceptable to provide further incentive that the terms and conditions are complied with. It is therefore the combination of all of the terms and conditions which lead me to the conclusion that I do today."
