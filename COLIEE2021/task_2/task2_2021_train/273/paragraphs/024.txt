For the respondent it could be said that it was known to all concerned that the money was coming from each respondent's brother in the United States so that the reference to anyone was really a reference to the brothers. A reading of the adjudicator's decision shows that he dismissed the issue of the relationship of the surety with the respondent and seemed to rely only on the risk of forfeiture. In the circumstances of a criminal smuggling operation, this is an unreasonable error.
