The Adjudicator's final observation that the CFIA's decision to remove Dr. Frazee's inspection responsibilities during the review process was, by itself, evidence of discipline, represents circular reasoning. The stated purpose of the decision was to ensure that Dr. Frazee's critics could not complain about his involvement in the review. Whether, in the circumstances, a better decision could have been made by the CFIA is not relevant to the proper characterization of the decision taken, provided that it had a legitimate operational rationale to support it. In the absence of evidence that the CFIA managers were acting for some contrary or ulterior motive, the conduct of Dr. Frazee does not appear to have been under scrutiny as blameworthy.
