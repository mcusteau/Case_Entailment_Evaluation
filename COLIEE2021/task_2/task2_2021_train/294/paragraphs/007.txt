The Applicants now argue that the Officer erred in making the negative decision because he based his decision on the fact that the original reason for their entry into Canada had come to an end. The Applicants say that this is an error because it ignores the recognition in the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2002, c. 27 (the "
Act
") and the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations
, SOR/2002-227 (the "
Regulations
") that persons who apply for permanent residence in Canada are not consequently precluded from remaining as visitors. In this regard, the Applicants rely on section 22(2) of the
Act
and section 183 of the
Regulations
.
