  As for the submissions that the findings of fact by the vis officer were patently unreasonable, I am not persuaded that this was the case. The applicant does not urge that she had experience in nude striptease dancing. Rather, her argument is that her experience in topless dancing qualified her as an exotic dancer, or even as a "striptease dancer" as her employer in Brasov recommended. The evidence before the visa officer was that she had no experience in "striptease or nude", as reported by the IPO on the basis of her interview. While the basis of the IPO's finding was explored in cross-examination on her affidavit, there is really no evidence before me that the IPO's assessment was in error. The contract the applicant had signed for work in Toronto required her to do nude striptease dancing. She does not claim experience in that work by her affidavit. The visa officer's finding that she was not really experienced in the type of work proposed cannot be said to be unreasonable.
