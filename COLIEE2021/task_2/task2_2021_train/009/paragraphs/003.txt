  At the Canadian Embassy she was interviewed by an Immigration Program Officer ("IPO"), a locally engaged staff person at the Embassy, who assisted in processing immigration applications. That person, as attested by her sworn affidavit, recorded in CAIPS notes the results of her interview including the following notations: 
 
 
 
 "Danced topless, no experience in striptease or nude. No qualification, trained on the job. 
 
 
 
 . . . . . 
 
 
 
 Has a 3 year UAE visa which was cancelled. Why? She went on contract also as dancer to UAE last year, she stayed six weeks but was not content with the salary which was lower than promised, so she returned to Romania. Does not make sense, why return when salary here in low, and why was the visa cancelled? Her employer did not want her to come back to UAE and work for somebody else.

 Difficult financial situation here, poor travel, no ties, her explanation re trip to UAE and the cancelled UAE visa not credible, I have doubts she is bona fide."
