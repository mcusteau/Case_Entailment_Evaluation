  Since there is no person directly affected by the decision of the Registrar which is the subject of this appeal nor any person who is required to be named as a party to the appeal pursuant to the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , Rule 303(2) of the  
 Federal Court Rules 
  must come into play. This rule is clear and provides that where there is no person directly affected by the decision in question, nor any person required to be named as a party pursuant to the  
 Act 
  under which the appeal is brought, it follows that the proper respondent is the Attorney General of Canada.
