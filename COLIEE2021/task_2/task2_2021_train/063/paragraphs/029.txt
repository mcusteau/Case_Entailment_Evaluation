 "I accept the premise that the decision that a trade mark is clearly descriptive is one of first impression from which it follows that it is not the proper approach to critically analyse the words of a mark but rather to ascertain the immediate impression created by the mark in association with the product. The mark must be considered in conjunction with the wares and not in isolation."
