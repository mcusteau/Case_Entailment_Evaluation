  In  
 Molson Breweries, A Partnership v. Labatt (John) Ltd. et al. 
 , [2000] F.C.J. No. 159; 252 N.R. 91, the Federal Court of Appeal addressed the question of the nature of an appeal under section 56 of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  and the applicable standard of review. Mr. Justice Rothstein, speaking for the majority, said as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Because of the opportunity to adduce additional evidence, section 56 is not a customary appeal provision in which an appellate court decides the appeal on the basis of the record before the court whose decision is being appealed. A customary appeal is not precluded if no additional evidence is adduced, but it is not restricted in that manner. Nor is the appeal a "trial de novo" in the strict sense of that term. The normal use of that term is in reference to a trial in which an entirely new record is created, as if there had been no trial in the first instance. [See Note 12 below] Indeed, in a trial de novo, the case is to be decided only on the new record and without regard to the evidence adduced in prior proceedings."
