  The sole ground of appeal advanced in the Notice of Application is as follows: 
 
 
 
 "(a) the Registrar erred in concluding that the mark SATIN STRIPES ("the Mark") is not registrable by reason of section 12(1)(b) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
  that is, that the Mark is clearly descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of the character or quality of wares with which it is proposed to be used, namely,  
 intimate apparel, namely bras and panties 
 ."
