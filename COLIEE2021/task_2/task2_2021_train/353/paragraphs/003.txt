In the Nansen Creek, Yukon area there is a series of claims recorded as J. Bill 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, and 32 lying on an approximately north-south axis straddling Nansen Creek or lying immediately to the east of it. East of these claims, but not immediately adjacent to them, lie claims named Bull 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10, their axis also lying more or less in a north-south direction. It is not in dispute that in between these two rows of claims there is "open ground" which, as of May, 1991, was not claimed. According to the applicant herein, this open ground varies in width from 200 to 800 feet. On May 30, 1991, a Mr. J.B. Fagan, acting on behalf of the applicant Aurchem, staked six claims for the applicant and named them Jon-Wedge 1-6. He placed the number 1 and 2 posts with respect to each claim at points he thought to be about 50 feet inside the eastern boundaries of the J. Bill claims. These posts were purportedly 1,500 feet apart and were to mark the southwest and northwest corners of claims which were purportedly to run 1,500 feet eastward of the axis of the posts.
