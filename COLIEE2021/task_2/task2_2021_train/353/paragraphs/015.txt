The applicant requests costs in this matter. Although rule 1618 now allows costs to be ordered only "for special reasons" I believe this is an appropriate place for costs to be ordered. This proceeding has been necessitated by a seemingly arbitrary change of practice in the office of the Mining Recorder and the applicant should receive some relief from the cost necessitated by this unpredictable departure from practice.
Application allowed.
