On May 31, 1991, Mr. Fagan filed in the office of the Mining Recorder of the Whitehorse mining district an "Application for a Full Claim Form 1 (s. 41)" in respect of each of the six Jon-Wedge claims. He described the claims as being 1,500 feet square and he swore the requisite affidavit which constitutes the application, including paragraph 6 stating that to the best of his knowledge and belief the ground within the boundaries of the said claim was unrecorded by any other person as a mineral claim. It is not in dispute that Mr. Fagan intentionally set the posts so as to overlap the J. Bill claims by 50 feet and that he was quite aware that any claims extending 1,500 feet eastward from those posts would overlap the Bull claims. The rationale for staking in this way, according to the applicant, is so as to avoid any open ground being left inadvertently because of the difficulties of precise measurement of the boundaries of claims. The evidence on behalf of the applicant is to the effect that this is the usual practice in staking claims.
