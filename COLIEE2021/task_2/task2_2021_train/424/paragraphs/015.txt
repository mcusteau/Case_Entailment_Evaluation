Thirdly, in order for me to reach the conclusion urged by counsel for the respondent, I would have to read in the words "where the person against whom a deportation order was made has a right of appeal to the Appeal Division" at the beginning of s. 49(1)(b), the words "or the Appeal Division loses jurisdiction" at the end of that paragraph, or similar words to that effect. Alternatively, I would have to read in words to s. 49(1.1) to exclude from the ambit of s. 49(1), persons who have lost their right of appeal to the Appeal Division because of the issuance of a "danger to the public" opinion. I decline to do so. In
Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. Dearborn
(1919), 58 S.C.R. 315, Chief Justice Davies laid down the general principle governing the reading in or deletion of statutory language. He states at pp. 320-321:
"I cannot admit the right of the courts where the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous to practically amend such statute either by eliminating words or inserting limiting words unless the grammatical and ordinary sense of the words as enacted leads to some absurdity or some repugnance or inconsistency with the rest of the enactment, and in those cases only to the extent of avoiding that absurdity, repugnance and inconsistency."
This principle was reiterated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Lawson v. Wellesley Hospital
, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 893; 15 N.R. 271.
