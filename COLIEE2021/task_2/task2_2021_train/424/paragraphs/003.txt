On the basis of the 1994 convictions, an inquiry was held before an immigration adjudicator (the "adjudicator") on November 30, 1994. The adjudicator found the applicant to be a person described in s. 27(1)(d)(i) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2, (the "
Act
"). On this basis, the adjudicator issued a conditional deportation order against the applicant pursuant to s. 32.1(4) of the
Act
. The applicant filed an appeal to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Appeal Division") against the deportation order. To date, no action has been taken by the Appeal Division in respect of the applicant's appeal.
