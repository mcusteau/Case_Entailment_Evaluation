Gibson, J.
: These reasons arise out of an application by the applicant, Emmanuel Solis, for an order, pursuant to s. 18.2 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, staying the execution of a removal order issued against him. Removal was scheduled for the 6th of March 1997. This application was heard by way of a teleconference on that day. I dismissed the application. At the request of counsel for the respondent, I undertook to provide reasons. These are my reasons.
