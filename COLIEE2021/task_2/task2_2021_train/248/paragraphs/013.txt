Subsequent to my order, however, the applicant applied for the release of certain documents pursuant to the
Access to Information Act
and received some of the documents which were subject to my order of nondisclosure. On the respondent's motion, I reviewed the secret file and issued another order on February 15, 1995, again ordering nondisclosure with the exception of the seven documents already released to the applicant under the
Access to Information Act
and an internal government memorandum. Although some of the documents have been released to the applicant, I am satisfied that the remainder of the secret file should remain confidential.
