deprived her of her right to liberty and her security of person, guaranteed in s. 7 of the
C
harter
and ss. 1(a)(b) and (e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
. Furthermore, the deprivation of her rights is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice, as provided in s. 7 of the

and s. 2(e) of the
Bill of Rights
, since she was neither provided with disclosure of the allegations against her nor did she have an opportunity to respond.
