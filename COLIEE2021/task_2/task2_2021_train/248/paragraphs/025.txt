Having found that the applicant has not been deprived of her right to life, liberty, or security of the person, contrary to the principles of fundamental justice, there is no need to consider the arguments advanced under s. 1 of the
Charter
and the applicant's proposed remedy of having the court provide a summary of the secret material or allowing counsel access on an undertaking not to disclose. I have also not considered the applicant's submissions concerning the
Canadian Bill of Rights
.
