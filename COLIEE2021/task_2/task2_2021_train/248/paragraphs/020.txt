Frankly, I have some difficulty accepting that the applicant's rights have been impaired in any way. The applicant does not, as she contends, have a right to come to Canada; at best, she has a right to apply to come to Canada. Furthermore, there is no evidence to support the applicant's submission that she has suffered psychological stress or that her reputation has been tarnished. My conclusions on the impairment of the applicant's rights are sufficient to dispose to the constitutional argument; however, I am further satisfied that the applicant has failed to make out a case that the procedure prescribed in s. 82.1(10) of the
Immigration Act
violates the principles of fundamental justice.
