The applicant further submitted that she was denied procedural fairness since the visa officer took into account evidence that post-dated his decision. The applicant directed me to documents attached as an exhibit to the Delisle affidavit, a few of which post-dated the decision concerning the applicant. The visa officer, however, swore that he took into account the documents attached as an exhibit in arriving at his decision. The applicant submitted that the visa officer cannot rely on this evidence in arriving at his decision and I agree. I am not prepared to conclude, however, that the visa officer failed to comply with the duty of fairness simply because these documents are attached as an exhibit to his affidavit. First, the documents in question are a minority; the bulk of the evidence predates the decision and entirely supports the visa officer's decision. Second, I am prepared to accept that the inclusion of the postdated documents was an administrative slip. As the visa officer explained in cross-examination, he has a "clippings file" to which he regularly adds information and from which he gathers evidence in making a decision. Obviously, a few wayward documents were accidently attached to the affidavit and I do not accept that the visa officer purposely tried to bolster his decision after the fact.
