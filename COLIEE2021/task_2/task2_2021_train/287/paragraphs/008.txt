It is quite clear that the allegation of invalidity pleaded in paragraph 3 of the amended defence asserts a conclusion of law and must be supported by a statement of the material facts on which the conclusion of law is based. Further, in the circumstances the said pleading must indicate on what part of s. 18(1) of the Act its allegation of invalidity is based. These particulars must be provided by the defendant. The purpose of the particulars is obviously to enable a party to know the adversary's position and so avoid being taken unawares [see footnote 1].
