  At the hearing before the Appeal Board, the member of the Selection Board who rated the personal suitability of the candidates testified that he assessed the candidates on the basis of his knowledge of them and comments made to him by several foremen who had worked with them. In discussing with these foremen the matter of the personal suitability of the candidates, the member of the Selection Board did not ask any specific questions. However, he asked some of the foremen the same questions concerning some of the candidates. Although the member of the Selection Board testified that he recorded in writing some of the comments made by the foremen, he was unable to produce any such documentation or information. In response to questions from the Chairman of the Appeal Board concerning the identical ratings of the candidates on personal suitability, the member explained that he could "... find no difference that made any difference on -- appreciable difference on the thing". He further testified that "the answers I got from the people led me to believe that that was where I should place them".
