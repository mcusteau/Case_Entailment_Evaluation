  In my opinion, the Appeal Board erred in law in misconstruing the duty of the Selection Board to rate the candidates on all of the qualifications required for the position in a manner which would permit "... an assessment of the candidates' relative merit". (See  
 Tiefenbrunner et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , decision dated November 10, 1992, No. A-915-91, F.C.A.). In the present case, there was an absence of any cogent evidence, either oral or documentary, in the record to establish the manner in which the merit of the candidates was assessed by the Selection Board on the qualification of personal suitability. In the absence of an appropriate evidentiary framework, the Appeal Board could not have properly determined that the merit principle was respected in the assessment of the candidates on personal suitability. Furthermore, the Appeal Board purported to place on the applicant the obligation to adduce evidence to establish that her personal qualities "... should have been rated any differently than the personal qualities of the selected candidate". In doing so, the Appeal Board improperly relieved the Selection Board of its onus of establishing that the assessment of the candidates was conducted in accordance with the merit principle.
