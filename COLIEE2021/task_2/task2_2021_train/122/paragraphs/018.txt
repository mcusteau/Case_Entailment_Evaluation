  Broadly speaking, reasonableness is also the standard applicable to a review of the IAD's interpretation of the Regulations ( 
 Dunsmuir

 Khosa 
 , above, at para 44;  
 Alberta (Information and Privacy Commissioner) v Alberta Teachers' Association, 
  2011 SCC 61, at para 30, [2011] 3 SCR 654 [ 
 Alberta Teachers 
 ]). However, in this particular case, the issue of which version of section 4 applies to the IAD's determination of appeals of decisions that were made prior to September 30, 2010 engages the principles of fundamental fairness and natural justice. In my view, the IAD does not have any specialized expertise with respect to these principles, or, indeed, with respect to the determination of which version of section 4 is applicable in a particular hearing. Therefore, the standard of review applicable in assessing that issue is correctness ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 , above at paras 55, 79 and 90;  
 Khosa 
 , above, at para 43;  
 Alberta Teachers 
 , above, at para 46).
