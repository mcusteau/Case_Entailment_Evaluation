  Ms. Kaur Gill asserts that the IAD committed a number of errors in dismissing her appeal of the visa officer's rejection of her spousal sponsorship application. Those alleged errors can be conveniently summarized as follows: 
 
 
 
 i. the IAD unreasonably concluded that her marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , S.C. 2001, c. 27 [IRPA]; and 
 
 
 
 ii. the IAD applied the wrong test in rejecting her application.
