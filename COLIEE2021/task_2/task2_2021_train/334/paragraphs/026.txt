Gao's second argument is that the Immigration Officer's decision was patently unreasonable, on the ground that, although the positive Glendale assessment had been undertaken at the request of HW for immigration purposes, no second medical opinion had been issued since the January 1988 Medical Notification. The Glendale report did not support the medical profile on that Medical Notification, the HW assessment was inconsistent with the medical profile on that Medical Notification, and thus the medical evidence was conflicting and contradictory.
