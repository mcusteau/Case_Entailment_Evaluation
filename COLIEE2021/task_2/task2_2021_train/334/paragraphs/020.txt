The only evidence of a December 1990 review is a letter addressed to counsel for the Minister from Dr. Ferrari dated February 12, 1992 (Shapka affidavit, Exhibit "C"), over a month following Gao's initiation of s. 82.1 proceedings. The purpose of this letter was to provide counsel with all of Qi's medical reports. It states:
"
As you will note he [Qi] was assessed M5 because of the possibility of his improvement over time.
"When the additional reports arrived in 1990 ... they were reviewed and the case was discussed at a M.O.'s conference. It was decided at the time that
there had not been sufficient improvement to warrant a change in assessment. A note on file reads 'If Immigration request a further assessment, will Be M5' - dated December 12, 1990.
"It will be clear, I think, that unless this child improves significantly he will never be self-sufficient and will always require some type of assistance and supervision. He will therefore make excessive demands on our social services." (emphasis added)
