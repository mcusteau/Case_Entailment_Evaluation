Gao was provided with a copy of the January 1988 Medical Notification. In July of that year Gao claimed Convention refugee status for himself, his wife and Qi, which claim fell under "backlog" rules. In February 1990, he was called to a preliminary interview in order to determine whether there were sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds on which to process the family for landing. As a result of this interview, Qi, now 8, was referred for a third medical assessment.
