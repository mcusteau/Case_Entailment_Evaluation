Most of the case law relating to medical inadmissibility decisions by visa or Immigration Officers has issued from appellate bodies (from the former Immigration Appeal Board, the current Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board, and, on appeal from decisions of those two bodies, from the Federal Court of Appeal). The general principles arising from these cases are of course relevant to a judicial review application seeking to quash an Immigration Officer's decision.
