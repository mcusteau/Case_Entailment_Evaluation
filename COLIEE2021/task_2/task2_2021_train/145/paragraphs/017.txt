  Such a finding might have been open to the Board, had it not committed an error which I find to be fatal to the decision. I agree with the applicant's position that the Board misconstrued the central element of her claim. For the Board's conclusion to be reasonable, it must first characterize the claim in such a way that is responsive to the allegations put forward by the applicant. Without coming to any conclusions as to the existence of the social group put forward by the applicant, I am satisfied that it was incumbent upon the Board to properly identify and address this question.
