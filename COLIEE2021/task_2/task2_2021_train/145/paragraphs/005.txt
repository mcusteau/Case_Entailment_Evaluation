  The applicant entered the US using a false passport in 1998, at the age of fourteen. She stayed with a friend of her mother who assisted her in making an asylum claim. Following a dispute between the mother and her friend, the applicant had to leave the friend's home at the age of fifteen. No follow up was done on her pending refugee claim. When the applicant discovered that she had no legal status in the US, she consulted case workers at Catholic Charities. She was informed that nothing could be done to regularize her immigration status in the US.
