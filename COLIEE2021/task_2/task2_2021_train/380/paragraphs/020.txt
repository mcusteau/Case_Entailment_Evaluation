I conclude that the Applicants' case must fail on this ground. In
Nueda v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(Court File: 92-T-1401, June 11, 1993 (unreported)) Cullen, J., stated as follows:
"Next, the doctor's report is honest and probably frightening. The officers did not seem too impressed but they did not ignore it.
. . . . .
"As emphasized earlier it is my responsibility to review the decision of the officers and this is not to be seen as an appeal from that decision. All of the data were before the officers and I could find nothing they ignored. There were positive aspects of the applicant's case such as her work record with L'Hotel and her knowledge of the English language. Similarly, there was for consideration by the officers the doctor's report and the impact of a negative decision, namely return to the Philippines to poverty or near poverty conditions. In the final analysis all this was before the officers and considered. The applicant may not and obviously does not agree with the officers' treatment of the medical report but it was considered."
