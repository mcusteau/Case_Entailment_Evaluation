On the basis of my review of the evidence before me, I conclude that this question must be answered in the affirmative. I conclude that the decision taken by Officer Bauly was reasonably open to her, particularly having regard to the dearth of evidence as to environmental conditions throughout Poland and their potential impact on the health and well-being of the Applicant Rafal Lemiecha, taking into account medical services and expertise and facilities in that country. Whether I might have reached the same decision on the evidence that was before Officer Bauly is not at issue on judicial review.
