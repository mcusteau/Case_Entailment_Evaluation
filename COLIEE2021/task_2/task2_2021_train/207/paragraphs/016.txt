 [16] 
  In trying to persuade the Court that the panel erred in the negative inferences which it drew from the evidence as to his credibility, the applicant in fact sought to justify parts of the testimony which the panel rejected because it found them unreliable or unsatisfactory. It should be borne in mind that the applicant had an opportunity to present his explanations to the panel in full; but unfortunately for him, the panel did not find them to be credible. It is not this Court's function to repeat that exercise. The panel has the benefit of relying on its expertise, and especially of hearing the applicant and his explanations, which certainly puts it in a better position than this Court to determine his credibility. It is not this Court's function to do the panel's work, but simply to determine whether its decision was unreasonable in the sense indicated by  
 Dunsmuir, supra
