  This argument by the applicant disregards the presumption that the panel has considered all the evidence before it ( 
 Florea v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 
 , [1993] F.C.J. No. 598 (C.A.) (QL)). It also overlooks the fact that when the panel concludes that a refugee status claimant is not credible it does not have a duty to explain the reasons why it attaches no evidentiary value to the documents supporting the allegations which it has found to be not credible ( 
 Ahmad v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2003 FCTD 471,  
 per 
  Rouleau J., at para. 26).
