Having read the evidence, in particular the affidavits of Mr. Thompson and Ms. Phelan, I am not satisfied that the addressee to whom the Minister's decision was sent by registered mail on October 30, 1996 was in error. The evidence indicates that the original Notice of Ascertained Forfeiture dated May 25, 1994 was served on Mr. David Woodall of "Satellite Supply Division (928412 Ont. Ltd.)". The decision of the Minister dated October 29, 1996, as well as the correspondence of counsel for the plaintiff in the period before that October date refer to the plaintiff as "Satellite Supply Division (928412 Ont. Ltd.)".
