On the basis of the above, I have concluded that the initiation of these proceedings, commenced by statement of claim filed in the court on January 30, 1997, was not within the 90 day limitation period provided by s. 135(1) of the
Customs Act
, and therefore this court is without jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff's claim. Moreover, this court does not have jurisdiction to extend the limitation period fixed by Parliament (see
Dawe v. Minister of National Revenue (Customs and Excise)
(1994), 174 N.R. 1 (F.C.A.).).
