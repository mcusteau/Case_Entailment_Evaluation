Furthermore, the submission of the plaintiff that s. 48(2) stands for the proposition that filing is accomplished by forwarding the document by registered mail to the Registry is simply not supported by the language of s. 48 itself. The manner in which a claim against the Crown is initiated, by filing a document in the Federal Court, is provided for in s. 48(1). In my view, s. 48(2) simply provides means by which an individual "may" transmit a document to the Registry to be filed other than by doing so in person as is implied by s. 48(1). This is clearly indicated by the language of s. 48(2), which provides that documents "
may
be filed as required by s. (1)
" where they are sent by registered mail, along with payment for the fee for filing to the Registry of the court. Section 48(2) simply offers an alternate means by which an individual may deliver to the Registry a document to be filed as required by s. 48(1). It does not, in my view, in and of itself constitute "filing" for the purposes of the
Act
