Therefore, in the present motion, the plaintiff takes issue with the defendant's characterizations of both the date on which the statement of claim was deemed to have been "filed" with the court, as well as the date upon which notice of the ministerial decision was received. More specifically, the argument advanced by the plaintiff is two-fold: (i) that its statement of claim was effectively "filed" on January 24, 1997, the date on which it was sent by registered mail to the Registry; and (ii) that because it was not properly addressed to the corporate plaintiff, notice of the decision of the Minister was not effective until it was received on November 4, 1996. Accordingly the plaintiff submits, it is only upon this date, the date of actual notification, November 4, 1996, that the 90 day limitation period set out in s. 135(1) commences.
i) When Was The Statement
Of Claim "Filed"?
