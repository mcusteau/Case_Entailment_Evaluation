The submission of the plaintiff that the "filing" of the statement of claim was achieved on the date it was sent to the court by registered mail is simply untenable. Further, references to provisions of the
Income Tax Act
are irrelevant in the present case as the provisions in the
Federal Court Rules
regarding "filing" are clear. In the present case, "filing" of the statement of claim was achieved on the date on which it was received by the Registry of this court. This conclusion, in my view, is amply supported by both the language of the provisions regarding "filing" contained in the
Federal Court Act
, as well as the jurisprudence of this court.
