 [25] 
  In his written statement, the applicant pled that he only became aware on June 11, 2013 that this document had been faxed on February 25, 2013 by CIC (which had seized it on January 29, 2013) to the applicant's former lawyer. As such, it had been impossible for him to produce it before the RPD. The applicant argued that he needed it for his appeal in order to prove that the RPD had erred in not believing that CIC had seized it. Considering that his failure to produce this diploma negatively affected his overall credibility, the applicant argued that it was of paramount importance to have it before the RAD.
