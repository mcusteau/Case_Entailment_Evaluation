  There are several recent decisions of this Court concerning both the role of the newly created RAD, and of this Court upon judicial review of decisions made by the RAD (see  
 Iyamuremye v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 494;  
 Garcia Alvarez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 702;  
 Eng v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 711;  
 Huruglica v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 CF 799 [ 
 Huruglica 
 ];  
 Njeukam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 859;  
 Yetna v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2014 FC 858; and  
 Spasoja c Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)

 Alyafi v Canada (Minister of Immigration and Citizenship) 
 , 2014 FC 952, Justice Martineau, who did not specifically need to take position on these issues, made an interesting review of this Court's previous decisions.
