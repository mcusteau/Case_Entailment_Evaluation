  The RAD determined that subsection 110(4) is very similar to paragraph 113( 
 a 
 ) of the Act, which deals with the admissibility of fresh evidence before a PRRA officer. As such, the RAD applied the criteria emanating from  
 Raza v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2007 FCA 385 [ 
 Raza 
 ] at para 13, and evaluated the credibility, the relevance, the newness, and the materiality of the evidence in order to decide on its admissibility.
