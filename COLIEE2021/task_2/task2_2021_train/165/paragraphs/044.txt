  The applicant argues that by not admitting the 2002 school diploma into evidence, the RAD failed to admit a document that not only goes to the core of his story, but also to the RPD's finding of credibility which consequently, gravely prejudices his claim. The RAD failed to properly apply  
 Raza, 
  as this "new evidence" satisfies the  
 Raza 
  test insofar that the document: (a) is credible; (b) is pertinent; (c) is "new" in that it can refute a factual conclusion drawn by the RPD; (d) is of substantial character; and (e) was not raised before the board through no fault of the applicant. The RAD could not have reasonably expected that it be produced by the applicant at the time of the RPD hearing.
