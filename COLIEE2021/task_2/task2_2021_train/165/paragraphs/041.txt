  In  
 Alberta Teachers 
 , Justice Binnie set out that an issue of general legal importance is one "whose resolution has significance outside the operation of the statutory scheme under consideration." The Supreme Court of Canada has since not identified a case that raised a "question of central importance to the legal system as a whole." Moreover, since  
 Alberta Teachers 
 , the Supreme Court of Canada has reiterated its strict limitations to the use of the exceptions to the reasonableness standard. In  
 McLean v British Columbia (Securities Commission) 
 , 2013 SCC 67, the Court found that deference is owed to provincial securities' regulators interpretation of statute of limitation provisions, despite it being a "technical" question, rather than a "bureaucratic" one.
