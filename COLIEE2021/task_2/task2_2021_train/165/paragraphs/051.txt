 [51] 
  The language of paragraph 113( 
 a 
 ) is similar to that of subsection 110(4). The latter provision sets out that the RAD can only declare evidence admissible if it arose after the RPD's rejection of the claim or if it was not reasonably available or if the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented it (unlike for paragraph 113( 
 a 
 ), the French version of subsection 110(4) does not use "reasonably have been expected" but rather the equivalent of "normally have been expected"). The RAD however considers this evidence in a very different light than does the PRRA officer; it is doing so in an appellate review of the  
 correctness 
  of the RPD's determination.
