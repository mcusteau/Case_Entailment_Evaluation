  In the case at bar, the evidence at issue could be material for demonstrating that the RPD erred in two key credibility findings: first, the RPD wrongly believed that the CBSA had not confiscated the 2002 diploma, and second, that the document lends further credence that the applicant did in fact go to school with Bhupinder Singh until 2002. These findings surely affected the totality of the credibility assessment made by the RPD.
