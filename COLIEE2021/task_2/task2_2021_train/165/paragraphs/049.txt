  Unlike a PRRA officer, the RAD is a quasi-judicial administrative tribunal, trusted to act as an instance of appeal of the RPD's determination of a refugee's claim. While both a PRRA decision and a RPD decision in certain instances of restriction-as detailed in subsection 110(2), are not subject to appeal, except in circumstances where there are applications for leave and for judicial review by this Court, the RPD's determination of a claim not falling under the scope of a restriction stipulated under subsection 110(2) is subject to an automatic right of appeal to the RAD. Only upon receiving the "final" RAD decision can the claimant seek leave to this Court. Moreover, in revisiting the RPD's decision, unlike this Court, the RAD has the power-as expressly granted by the legislature under paragraph 111( 
 b 
 ), to  
 set aside 
  the RPD's decision and  
 substitute 
  a determination that, in its opinion, should have been made.
