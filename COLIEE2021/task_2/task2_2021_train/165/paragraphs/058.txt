 [58] 
  In order to achieve statutory coherence, in that the RAD would be able to hear fleshed out appeals of questions of fact and of mixed fact and law, the main issue is whether the evidence "was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably (or normally according to the French version) have been expected in the circumstances to have presented." 
 
 
 
 Was the RAD's application of subsection 110(4) of the Act to the facts of this case reasonable?
