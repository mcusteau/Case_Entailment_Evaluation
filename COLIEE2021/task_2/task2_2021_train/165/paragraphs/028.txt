 [28] 
  With respect to which standard of review to apply to the RPD's decision, invoking  
 Newton v Criminal Trial Lawyers' Association 
 , 2010 ABCA 399, the RAD held that the RPD, as a first instance tribunal, is owed deference, and that its findings of fact and of mixed fact and law decisions must be assessed on a reasonableness standard. Questions of law and of procedural fairness are to be evaluated on the correctness standard.
