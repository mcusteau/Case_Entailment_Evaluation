 [45] 
  The applicant adds that the RAD failed to give sufficient weight to the following factors: 
 
 
 
 1. The document was of critical probative value to the applicant's claim because it proved that he attended school with Bhupinder Singh at that time and that he was not lying about this fact; 
 
 
 
 2. Although the document was initially seized by the CBSA, the RPD did not believe this part of the applicant's testimony when in fact it was true (i.e. this demonstrates that the applicant was not lying); and 
 
 
 
 3. The RAD recognized that the failure to produce the document was the fault of the lawyer yet nonetheless it blamed the applicant, whose case was entirely in the hands of his lawyer(s), and who likely did not know what documents may have been missing from his file or that the document in question was of such critical importance to his claim.
