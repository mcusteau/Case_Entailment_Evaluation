 [4] 
  For the purpose of the present application, it is sufficient to say that this Court clearly rejected the position taken by the RAD in the decision under review, that it owes deference to the findings of the RPD and that it should apply the reasonableness standard, as this Court does when reviewing the RPD decisions that are not subject to an appeal before the RAD.
