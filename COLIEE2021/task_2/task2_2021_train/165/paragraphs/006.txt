 [6] 
  The RAD applied the jurisprudence of this Court interpreting paragraph 113( 
 a 
 ) of the Act  
 mutatis mutandis 
  to the interpretation of its subsection 110(4). Paragraph 113( 
 a 
 ) deals with the admissibility of fresh evidence before a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment [PRRA] officer (that had not been before the RPD). While the RAD ultimately held that the RPD unreasonably determined that the applicant had failed to satisfactorily demonstrate his identity for other reasons, the applicant maintains that the credibility determination was compromised by the RAD's refusal to admit his new evidence.
