There is considerable strength to the applicants' argument that vulnerable claimants require greater care in presenting their evidence and that may well mean that counsel should be permitted to assist their clients by questioning them first, but I am not persuaded that this cannot be accommodated on a case-by-case basis with prior notice to the Board that a change in the order may be required. It is not every case that would require counsel to question first and I am satisfied from the additional evidence filed in these proceedings that members can and do make appropriate decisions to change the order of questioning when presented with a request and supporting information.
