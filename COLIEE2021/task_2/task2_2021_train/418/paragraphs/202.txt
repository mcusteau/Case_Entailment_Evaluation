In
Farkas
, a Board ruling was set aside because of persistent and aggressive questioning by one of the Board members. Similarly in
Sandor
, the Court found that extensive questioning by a Board member constituted a breach of natural justice and the denial of the right to a fair hearing. But these decisions do not support the proposition that a change in the order of questioning in itself gives rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.
