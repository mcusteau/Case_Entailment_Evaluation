The introduction to the Guideline states, in part:
"Administrative tribunals operate less formally and more expeditiously than courts of law. Accordingly, the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
(
IRPA
) requires the IRB to deal with proceedings before it informally, quickly and fairly. The Chairperson has issued these guidelines to explain what the RPD does before and during the hearing to make its proceedings more efficient but still fair. The guidelines also set out what the RPD expects participants to do.
"The guidelines apply to most cases heard by the RPD. However, in compelling or exceptional circumstances, the members will use their discretion not to apply some guidelines or to apply them less strictly.
"Generally speaking, the RPD will make allowances for unrepresented claimants who are unfamiliar with the Division's processes and rules. Claimants identified as particularly vulnerable will be treated with special sensitivity."
