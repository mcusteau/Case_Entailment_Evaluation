Pursuant to Rule 105(a) of the
Federal Court Rules
, Justice Snider's Order provided that the consolidated judicial reviews were, in part, to be heard together, or one immediately after the other, at the discretion of the hearing judge. Further to Rule 107(1), the issues in the consolidated judicial reviews that relate in whole or in part to Guideline 7 were to be determined separately following a single hearing with counsel located in centres outside the Greater Toronto Area participating by video conference if it were impractical to attend in person. The Order also instructed that any remaining issues on each of the consolidated cases were to be determined in separate hearings presided over by one or more different judges, on dates that are as early as practicable following the expedited hearing of the Guideline 7 issues. It also set out deadlines for the filing of further written submissions and affidavits and completion of cross-examinations on the affidavits.
