[138]
In
Gonzalez Vazquez
, the oral hearing took place while the decision in
Thamotharem
was pending. The Court gave counsel the opportunity to submit written submissions once the
Thamotharem
reasons were available. Due to an administrative error, the respondent's submissions were not placed before the Court before the Order was initially signed on January 31, 2006 (see the amended reasons issued February 9, 2006). Thus they were not taken into account in the reasons for the decision which refer solely to the
Thamotharem
and
Jin
decisions.
