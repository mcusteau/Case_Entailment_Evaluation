The rationale for why an applicant must raise a violation of natural justice or apprehension of bias at the earliest practical opportunity was articulated by Justice Pelletier (as he was then), in
Mohammadian v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] 3 F.C. 371; 185 F.T.R. 144; 4 Imm. L.R.(3d) 131 (T.D.), affd. [2001] 4 F.C. 85; 271 N.R. 91 (F.C.A.), where he stated at paragraph 25:
"There is a powerful argument in favour of such a requirement arising from judicial economy. If applicants are permitted to obtain judicial review of adverse decisions by remaining silent in the face of known problems of interpretation, they will remain silent. This will result in a duplication of hearings. It seems a better policy to provide an incentive to make the original hearing as fair as possible and to avoid repetitious proceedings. Applicants should be required to complain at the first opportunity when it is reasonable to expect them to do so."
Justice Pelletier went on to say at para. 26 "[t]he crucial element is the reasonableness of the expectation that the claimant complain at the first opportunity".
