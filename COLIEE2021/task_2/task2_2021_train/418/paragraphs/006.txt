Prior to the hearing on the Guideline 7 issues, one application was resolved on consent leaving 19 which were the subject of these proceedings. The hearing took place at Toronto on March 7 and 8, 2006 with counsel participating by video conference from Montreal and Halifax. Submissions were received from counsel for each of the applicants in sequence, followed by the respondent's consolidated submissions. Reply submissions were received in the same order. As one of the applicants sought and was granted leave, on consent, to file an IRB document during reply submissions, Counsel were invited to submit further written representations on the content of that document following the hearing as well as to propose serious questions of general importance for certification in accord with
IRPA
s. 74.
