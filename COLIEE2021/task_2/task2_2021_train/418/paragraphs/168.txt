The evidence indicates that the Board was monitoring compliance with the implementation of the Chairperson's guidelines through a voluntary reporting system employing "Hearing Information Sheets". Members were invited to self-report on their use of the guidelines. Paul Aterman's evidence was that the response rate on these forms was very low. Thus it is difficult to understand how that might be perceived as coercive. At most, this would seem to be a normal and unthreatening procedure to gauge the effects of a policy.
