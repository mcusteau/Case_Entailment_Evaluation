After the hearing, on March 13, 2006, counsel for one of the applicants brought a motion in writing pursuant to Rule 369 for an Order to permit the applicant to amend his application record to include a second affidavit from Mr. Boulakia, attaching a recent decision by a RPD member opposed to Guideline 7. The respondent opposed that motion on the ground that it was incompatible with the Order of Justice Snider dated February 20, 2006. By Order dated April 1, 2006, I dismissed the motion to amend the application record.
