[137]
Contrary to what may have been suggested in
Jin
, fettering was argued and considered in
Zaki
, albeit without the extensive evidence and submissions that were before the Court in
Thamotharem
. The Court concluded that fettering could not be established in a hypothetical context and that on the record there was no evidence to support such a finding. At paragraph 16 the Court stated that the Guideline:
"... incorporates a flexible approach to the use of the RPD-first order of questioning; there is no rigid rule that purports to bind the RPD. It is up to each panel to determine, upon application, what order of questioning will be used. Whether a claimant will be granted the right to proceed first will depend on the facts of each case."
