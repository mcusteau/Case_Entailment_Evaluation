The defendant relies on the case of Spur Oil v. The Queen, [1983] 1 F.C. 244 (T.D.), as authority for the court justifying such a delay. In that case the application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was dismissed on September 30, 1981 but it was not until January 20, 1982 that the draft bill of costs was submitted and not until May 10, 1982 that a motion for leave to extend the period for bringing the motion for special directions with respect to costs was made when the opposite party refused to consent to the bill of costs submitted without an order for special directions. Plaintiff's answer to this submission leaves the matter to the court's discretion. While normally I believe that rules respecting delays for bringing such applications should be strictly applied there are perhaps some extenuating circumstances in the present case due to the complexity of the matter and the number of matters with respect to which defendant seeks special directions as to costs. In deciding to grant the delay as was done in the Spur Oil case, I am guided by 2 factors: first, I do not believe that plaintiff will suffer any prejudice as a result of the delay in dealing with this application; and second, on examining the merits of the application, it appears to me that the major items with respect to which defendant seeks special directions will not be granted, leaving merely some lesser matters to be dealt with to which plaintiff may well consent.
