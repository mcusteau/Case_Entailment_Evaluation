Although the witness Hanna was president of defendant, the separate corporate personality permits him to be taxed as a witness including his travel expenses for examination for discovery and trial, but not for any attendance for the purposes of giving instructions to counsel. The other witness Gervais can be properly taxed for his expenses for attending as a witness. Plaintiff conceeds this.
