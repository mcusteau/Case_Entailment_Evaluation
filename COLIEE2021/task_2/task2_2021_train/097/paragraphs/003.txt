  However, as I understand it, because of personalized risk and humanitarian and compassionate concerns, as unrepresented litigants the family members decided to challenge the decisions under review by filing independent judicial review applications each challenging both decisions; the mother and father filed together, and the Applicant and his sister filed separately. Prior to the leave stage, the applications could have been rejected as flawed in form, thus requiring the decisions to be addressed independently and perhaps in a single application for leave. Even in their presented form, the applications could have been rejected at the leave stage without being determined.

In my opinion the procedure adopted by the family was ill advised, because, as detailed below, it has worked a grave injustice to each member of the family other than the Applicant.
