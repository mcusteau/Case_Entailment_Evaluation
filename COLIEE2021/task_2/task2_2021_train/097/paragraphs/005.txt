  The injustice lies in the fact that the family's applications were not considered as a unit. As set out below, I find no reviewable error in the PRRA decision, but I find that the H&C decision is fundamentally flawed. Therefore, while the Applicant is entitled to a redetermination on the H&C decision, the other members of his family are not, even though the decision does not differentiate their pleas for humanitarian and compassionate relief. In my opinion this is unjust. The decisions under review did not make a distinction on the merits of the arguments tendered by the family, and, indeed, leave should have been determined in the same way; for an error warranting leave in either decision, all applications should have been granted leave.
