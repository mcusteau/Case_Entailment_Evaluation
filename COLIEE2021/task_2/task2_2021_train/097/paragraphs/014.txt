  The  
 Risk / Hardship Analysis 
  is internally inconsistent. The Applicants statements of risk upon return to Kenya are contained in the RPD decision, and, in addition, the Applicants supplied a wealth of material to the Visa Officer on risk arising from in-country conditions in Kenya. In arriving at the PRRA decision, the Visa Officer was required to read this evidence. Therefore, the statement that "the applicants do not appear to have provided any documents as evidence in support of their risk of returning to Kenya" while at the same time saying that "I am of the opinion that the risks described by the applicants would not be sufficient as to constitute a hardship if they were to return to Kenya" does not make sense unless it is understood that the Visa Officer failed in two respects.
