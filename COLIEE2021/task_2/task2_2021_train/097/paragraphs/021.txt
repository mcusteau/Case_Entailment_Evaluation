  While I only have jurisdiction to set aside the H&C decision with respect to the Applicant and to order a redetermination with respect to him, out of fairness, given the processing of this unrepresented family's pleas for humanitarian and compassionate relief, in my opinion the Applicant's parents, and his sister, are entitled to the same outcome. That is, it is not only fair for the members of the family to be granted reconsideration, but it is consistent with the manner in which the family's H&C application was conducted; they applied as a family, the decision was rendered in respect to them as a family, and the reconsideration should be granted to them as a family.
