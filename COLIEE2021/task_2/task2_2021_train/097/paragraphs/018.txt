  In my opinion, the use of the conclusion that the applicants are well established in Canada is perverse because it takes the existence of a factor set out in IP 5 as a consideration militating towards granting humanitarian and compassionate relief and uses it to do just the opposite. Obviously, the proven establishment of the applicants in Canada should work in their favour because there is absolutely no way of knowing whether the personal abilities they used to create this establishment can be used in Kenya to accomplish the same thing. To speculate that the applicants would be successful is a primary error, given the evidence of suffering they experienced in Kenya before fleeing to Canada.
