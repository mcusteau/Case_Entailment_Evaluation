  While the error identified is sufficient to require a redetermination on the H&C decision, I have a number of other judicial review concerns arising from the decision as quoted. While these concerns are not addressed in the written arguments, and were not addressed in the oral hearing of the Application, I find that, nevertheless, it is important to the quality of the redetermination to state them.
