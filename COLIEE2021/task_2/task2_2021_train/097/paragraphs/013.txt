  The  
 Risk / Hardship Allegations 
  section makes a critically important statement about the suffering that the Applicant's sister experienced in Kenya. Clarity is brought to this statement by the following description provided by the Applicant's father: 
 
 
 
 At the same time, my daughter Naomi was also facing turmoil during our absence. She was kidnapped, raped and left for dead, by unknown masked man. The good Samaritans took her to police and then to hospital. This man warned her that this was a lesson taught to my family, and as a result she became pregnant from the raping. She went through many difficulties during her pregnancy as she was again attacked at gunpoint at the chemist when the pregnancy was seven months, and almost miscarriaged and was taken to hospital which saved her life.

 In my opinion, if the Applicant's sister's experience is found to be a consideration in reaching a determination, as it was here, it was incumbent on the Visa Officer to reach a conclusion about the weight to be placed on the consideration. This was not done.
