Consequently, the sole issue in this appeal is whether the appellant has satisfied the requirements of section 44 of the Trade Marks Act and has shown use in Canada of the trademark "MacGregor" in association with "frozen fish and fillets thereof, smoked fish and fillets thereof and smoked kippered herring" at the relevant time. The appeal is under section 56 of the Trade Marks Act and there is no question that additional evidence may be adduced by affidavit beyond that adduced before the Registrar. A second affidavit of its Vice-President of Sales, Mr. I.R. Whitman, was adduced along with Exhibits A, B, C and D in this case by the appellant.
