It is appropriate to remember what was said by Thurlow, C.J., of the Federal Court of Appeal, in Plough (Canada) Ltd. v. Aerosol Fillers Inc., (1980), 34 N.R. 39; 53 C.P.R.(2d) 164, referred to by the Registrar in his decision, at page 66:
"What section 44(1) requires is an affidavit or statutory declaration not merely stating but 'showing', that is to say, describing the use being made of the trademark within the meaning of the definition of 'trademark' in section 2 and of 'use' in section 4 of the Act."
