I am satisfied that the second Whitman affidavit meets those requirements. At the time the "MacGregor" brand smoked kippered herring is exported from Canada to the United States, it is packed in plastic bags which are in turn packed in cardboard boxes, both of which prominently display the "MacGregor" trademark. Such packaging has been used by the appellant since 1975.
