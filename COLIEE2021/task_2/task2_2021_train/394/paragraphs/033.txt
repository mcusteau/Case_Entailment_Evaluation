In
Al Yamani v. Canada (Solicitor General) et al.
, now reported (1995), 103 F.T.R. 105; 129 D.L.R.(4th) 226 (T.D.). I recently held that a portion of s. 19(1)(g) of the
Act
contravened s. 2(d) of the
Charter
, insofar as it relates to "persons who there are reasonable grounds to believe ... are members of ... an organization that is likely to engage in ... acts" of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. The case involved the process of terminating the status of a permanent resident. That decision is on appeal. It was rendered after notice under s. 57 of the
Federal Court Act
and after thorough argument on the constitutional issues there raised. Those conditions do not here apply, s.Â 2 of the
Charter
was here raised only in brief reference in the written submissions of counsel and not discussed directly at the hearing. In these circumstances this court may not render a determination that the provision here in question is invalid for constitutional reasons.
