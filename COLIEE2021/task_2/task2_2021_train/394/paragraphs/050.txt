In both applications for judicial review it is urged that the applicant has a right to have his claim to be a Convention refugee determined in accord with the law prevailing at the time the applicant made his claim, i.e., December 22, 1988. After that date, on January 1, 1989, [see footnote 6] s. 46.01(1)(e)(ii) came into force. The current version of s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) came into force even later, on February 1, 1993 [see footnote 7].
