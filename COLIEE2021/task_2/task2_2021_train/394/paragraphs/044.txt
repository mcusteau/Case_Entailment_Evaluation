The place of s. 46.01(1)(e)(ii), in relation to s. 19(1)(f), is then to provide opportunity for the refugee claimant who is found to fall within s. (19)(1)(f) to persuade the Minister that it is in the public interest that his or her claim to be a refugee be considered. In effect, if the claimant persuades the Minister at this stage, that an exception should be made to the basic public interest declared by Parliament and that it is in the public interest that the claim be considered by the Refugee Division, he or she will meet the requirements for exemption under s. 19(1)(f). The onus is upon the claimant [see footnote 5]. As I understand the process, if no determination of that issue is made before there is a hearing by the Refugee Division of the refugee claim, the claimant remains inadmissible to Canada under s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) unless he or she can persuade the Minister that an exemption be made in his or her case on the ground that it would not be detrimental to the national interest.
