The case to be met was whether the Minister should form the opinion that it was not in the public interest to have Mr. McAllister's refugee claim determined under the
Act
. The issue was raised, as the letter makes clear, on the adjudicator's finding that he is a person who there are reasonable grounds to believe is or was a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe is or was engaged in terrorism, pursuant to ss. 27(2)(a) and 19(1)(f)(iii)(B). There was here no issue of credibility about the basis for that belief for Mr. McAllister acknowledged his membership at an earlier date in the INLA, a proscribed organization in Northern Ireland under emergency legislation there. Moreover, the letter of February 22, 1994, providing opportunity for his written submissions also indicated that the Minister's opinion would be based upon evidence submitted at the inquiry held earlier, in January 1994, and representations the applicant might make. Subsequently, in the letter of May 26, 1994 conveying his decision the Minister refers to counsel's submission on behalf of Mr. McAllister and specifically states that the submission and the available information concerning the applicant had been reviewed. There is no evidence that any information available to the Minister was other than that provided on behalf of the Minister at the January inquiry, which Mr. McAllister was aware of and a copy of which appears, from the record and from comments of his counsel at the hearing, to have been provided to him with the letter inviting submissions from him.
