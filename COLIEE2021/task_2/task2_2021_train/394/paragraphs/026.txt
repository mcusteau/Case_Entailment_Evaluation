Provisions of the
Act
, analogous to those applied in this case, that is, "access criteria" of another sort, were upheld in
Nguyen v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)
, [1993] 1 F.C. 696; 151 N.R. 69; 100 D.L.R.(4th) 151; 14 C.R.R.(2d) 146; 18 Imm. L.R.(2d) 165 (F.C.A.). There the Court of Appeal dismissed an application for judicial review of a decision of an adjudicator that a refugee claimant was not eligible to have his claim considered by the Refugee Division where he was found to be a person defined by then s.Â 46.01(1)(e)(ii)(B), as one convicted in Canada of an offence under any Act of Parliament for which a term of imprisonment of ten years or more may be imposed, who the Minister has certified constitutes a danger to the public in Canada. In that case Mr. Justice Marceau, for the court, commented: (
Nguyen
, at p. 704 of [1993] 1 F.C.; at p. 73 of 151 N.R.; at pp. 171-172 of 18 Imm. L.R.(2d); at pp. 156-157 of 100 D.L.R.(4th).)
"... A foreigner has no absolute right to be recognized as a political refugee under either the common law or any international convention to which Canada has adhered. It follows that legislation which purports to define conditions for eligibility to claim refugee status may violate the
Charter
only if those conditions have the effect of subjecting a group of claimants to discriminatory treatment within the meaning of s. 15. To deny dangerous criminals the right, generally conceded to immigrants who flee persecution, to seek refuge in Canada certainly cannot be seen as a form of illegitimate discrimination. Only s. 15 of the
Charter
is engaged since, contrary to the first decision which entailed forced deportation and therefore deprivation of liberty, a declaration of ineligibility does not imply or lead, in itself, to any positive act which may affect life, liberty or security of the person ..."
Mr. Justice Marceau also distinguished the circumstances in
Nguyen
from those in
Singh
on the ground that the former dealt with eligibility to have a refugee claim considered, while the latter concerned circumstances where the right to claim refugee status was "previously granted", presumably under the
Act
, and had not been withdrawn by statute.
