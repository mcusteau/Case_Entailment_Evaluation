The applicant, through his counsel, made submissions to the Minister by letter dated March 23, 1994. By letter dated May 26, 1994 the Minister informed the applicant, through counsel, that, having reviewed the submissions made for the applicant and available information concerning Mr. McAllister, the Minister was of opinion it would be contrary to the public interest to have the applicant's refugee claim determined under the
Act
. Subsequently the applicant was advised by notice from a senior immigration officer dated June 27, 1994 that he had been found to be ineligible under s. 45(1)(a) to have his claim to be a Convention refugee referred to the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. The basis of that determination was said to be the determination (earlier) by an adjudicator that he was a person described in s. 19(1)(f) and that the Minister is of opinion it would be contrary to the public interest to have his claim determined under the
Act
.
