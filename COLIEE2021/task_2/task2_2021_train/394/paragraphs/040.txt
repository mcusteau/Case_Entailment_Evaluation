In
Morales
the Supreme Court was not concerned with the
Immigration Act
, rather the case concerned s. 515(10)(b) of the
Criminal Code
which authorized pretrial detention of an accused by court order where that was "necessary in the public interest or for the protection or safety of the public, having regard to all the circumstances including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if he is released from custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice". The majority of the court found that provision, insofar as it authorized detention in "the public interest", violated s. 11(e) of the
Charter
which guarantees that any person charged with an offence has the right not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause.
