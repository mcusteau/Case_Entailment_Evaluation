The
Act
has been changed significantly since the decision in
Singh
. One major change was the introduction of "access criteria", precluding claimants for refugee status from having their claims determined by the Refugee Division of the Immigration Refugee Board in circumstances specified by s. 46.01 [see footnote 3] which came into force January 1, 1989, shortly after Mr. McAllister made his claim to be a refugee. That provision and ss. 27(2) and 19(1)(f) were relied upon by the Minister in this case [see footnote 4].
