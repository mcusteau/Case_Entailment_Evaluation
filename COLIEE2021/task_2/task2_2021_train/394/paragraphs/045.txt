[45]
In my opinion, the term "public interest" as used in s.Â 46.01(1)(e)(ii) does not render that provision so vague that its application by the Minister could not be subject to review, in a proper case, on an application for judicial review. The exercise of discretion under that provision is, after all, left to one whose function it is generally to exercise his authority in the public interest. The discretion may be broad, but where it is clearly exercised for a purpose not in the public interest, or without reference to evidence before the Minister, the court would set the decision aside. The use of the phrase "public interest" does not render s. 46.01(1)(e)(ii) of the
Act
vague for constitutional or other reasons.
