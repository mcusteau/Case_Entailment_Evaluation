[49]
As the Court of Appeal found in
Akthar
, so I here find that in the circumstances of this case where there is no evidence or inference of prejudice to the applicant as a result of delay, delay does not give rise to remedies under the
Charter
. There is no basis for intervention by the court because of delay in the process of considering Mr. McAllister's claim to be a refugee.
