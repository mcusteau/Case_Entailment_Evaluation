The standard to which Gonthier, J., refers as applicable to all enactments, whether civil, criminal, administrative or other, is one that ensures sufficient precision to provide guidance for legal debate, i.e., whether the circumstances are or are not within the intended application of the enactment in question. In passing, I note that in the application of this standard in the later
Morales
case, Gonthier, J., dissented from the majority view expressed by Lamer, C.J., finding the term "public interest" as used in the
Criminal Code
provision concerning detention prior to trial was not so vague as to contravene constitutional requirements. In the
Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Case
, where the Supreme Court upheld the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal that the word "unduly" as used in s.Â 32(1) of the
Combines Act
was not unconstitutionally vague, Gonthier, J., for the court noted that courts are reluctant to find statutory provisions are not enforceable because of vagueness: "the threshold for finding a law vague is relatively high". (Per Gonthier, J., at p. 632 of [1992] 2 S.C.R.; at p. 52 of 93 D.L.R.(4th); at p. 268 of 139 N.R.; at p. 306 of 74 C.C.C. (3d).)
