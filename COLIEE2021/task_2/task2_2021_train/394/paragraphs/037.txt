It is suggested the word "terrorism" is so imprecise, vague and ill-defined that the applicant is incapable of knowing in advance with a high degree of certainty what conduct constitutes "terrorism". In my opinion that is not an issue raised in the circumstances of this case. The applicant acknowledges his membership in the INLA, an organization about which there is evidence in news articles of its activities, at least in recent years, evidence that was before the inquiry and subsequently before the Minister and which was not apparently disputed as evidence of terrorist activity of the organization. Moreover, the word "terrorism" is not used in s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B) with reference to criminal activity, that is, with reference to commission of a crime, even if most acts of terrorism might also constitute crimes. The word is not used with reference to crimes of individuals. Rather the word is used in the
Immigration Act
, in describing activities of organizations, membership in which is prescribed by Parliament as a basis for exclusion from admissible classes of persons for immigration or for entry to Canada. "Terrorism" is defined by dictionaries, and a definition from Webster's dictionary is included in written submissions in support of Mr. McAllister's application for judicial review. It is there defined as "using terror and violence to intimidate, subjugate etc. especially as a political weapon or policy".
