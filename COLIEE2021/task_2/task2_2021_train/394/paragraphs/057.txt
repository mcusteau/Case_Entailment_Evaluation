[57]
It is my opinion that none of the grounds put forth for the applicant warrant intervention by this court in regard to the decision of the Minister pursuant to s. 46.01(1), or in regard to the decision of the senior immigration officer based on the decision of the Minister and the earlier decision of an adjudicator pursuant to s. 27(2)(a) and s. 19(1)(f)(iii)(B).
