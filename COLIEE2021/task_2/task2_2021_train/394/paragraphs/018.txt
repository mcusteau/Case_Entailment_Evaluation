The first ground argued on behalf of the applicant is that the Minister, in forming his opinion concerning the public interest, denied the applicant a fair hearing, to which he is entitled under s. 7 of the
Charter
[see footnote 1] and under s. 2(e) of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, S.C. 1960, c. 44 [see footnote 2]. The refugee determination process under the
Act
is subject to both s. 7 of the
Charter
and to s. 2 of the
Canadian Bill of Rights
, and denial of a right to make a claim to refugee status without a hearing may violate both the
Charter
and the
Bill of Rights
