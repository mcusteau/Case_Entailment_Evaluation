I must acknowledge that applicant's counsel has raised an interesting and arguable point. "Family obligations" are of both a legal and a moral order. Within the legal structure of the Immigration Act and of its Regulations, moral obligations would have no place. Absent any legal obligation under domestic law, the acknowledgment by an applicant that he respects his moral obligations toward his family in India should in no way prejudice the determination which must be made on his behalf. The factor which must be considered should only have relevance to his obligations toward family dependants residing in Canada.
