Counsel for the respondent Crown, in her reply, advances the principle of reasonableness in the interpretation of the Regulations, of its assessment factors and of the applicable guidelines. Counsel submitted that the whole scheme is to provide an applicant who is classified as a member of the refugee claims backlog with specially favourable treatment. Such an applicant need only establish to the satisfaction of an immigration officer that he has successfully established himself in Canada or has the potential to do so. Such an applicant does not have to subscribe to more substantial or technical requirements applicable to all other persons applying for and obtaining landed immigrant status in the normal way.
