The conclusion to be drawn from this is that in the factors outlined in both ss. 5(1) and 5(2) of the Regulations, the expression "family obligations" requires a restricted meaning. That meaning would limit the immigration officer's enquiry to those obligations relating to members of the family who are residing in Canada. Reference in the case to members of the family residing in India is extraneous and goes beyond the field of enquiry authorized by law.
