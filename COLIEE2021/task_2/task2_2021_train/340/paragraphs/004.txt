One should not venture into an issue of this nature without establishing the factual base which provoked the federal authority to adopt the Regulations in question. In the last few years, Canadian immigration policy and administrative practices had allowed thousands of nonresidents to arrive in Canada and thereafter claim refugee status. An accumulation of these cases was such that they could not be conveniently processed in the usual manner. The backlog of pending cases was too must to handle. It was therefore decided to institute a crash program to dispose of as many of these outstanding cases as possible using admissibility standards different from those applicable to the determination of refugee status.
