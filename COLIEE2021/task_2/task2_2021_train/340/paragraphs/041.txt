I should also refer to a standard rule of interpretation. At page 5 of Construction of Statutes (2nd Ed. Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), Elmer A. Driedger states that words in a statute must be given their ordinary meaning. This meaning is variously called common, popular or primary meaning. The author cites at page 6 Victoria (City) v. Bishop of Vancouver Island, [1921] 2 A.C. 384, where Lord Atkinson said at page 387:
"In the construction of statutes their words must be interpreted in their ordinary grammatical sense, unless there be something in the context, or in the object of the statute in which they occur, or in the circumstances with reference to which they are used, to show that they were used in a special sense different from their ordinary grammatical sense."
