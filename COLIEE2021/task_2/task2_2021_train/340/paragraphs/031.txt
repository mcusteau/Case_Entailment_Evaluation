To give judicious weight to this exceptional character of the scheme, counsel for the Crown argues for a wide interpretation of the criteria set out in s. 5. The thrust of these criteria, she says, are to measure the applicant's ability to survive in Canada. An applicant's family obligations are part of the applicant's whole picture and, as one of the several criteria outlined in that section, should be held to include obligations to family as a whole and not to those members of the family already residing in Canada. To narrow the enquiry on the basis proposed by the appellant would shortcircuit in many cases the process of the enquiry itself and of a more equitable determination of the application.
