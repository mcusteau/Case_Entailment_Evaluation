The next observation I would make touches upon the legislative intent in adopting the various factors listed for consideration in s. 5. I noted earlier that the Regulations set in motion a crash program to dispose, in the measure possible, of a very heavy backlog of resident persons in Canada claiming convention refugee status. The process adopted is quick and expeditious. It is not meant to get rid of the backlog, but to reduce it to manageable scale. It is not meant either to trigger off lengthy enquiries and multiple appeals creating a situation which might become as vexing as the problem it is meant to cure.
