A look at s. 6 of the Regulations, says counsel, provides additional grounds for such an interpretation. When this provision speaks of "a member and his dependant", it must necessarily refer to dependants of the applicant who are with him in Canada. In such circumstances, it would be proper to assess the applicant's successful establishment in terms of the applicant's obligations to them but not to other dependants who might otherwise come within the genus of "dependant".
