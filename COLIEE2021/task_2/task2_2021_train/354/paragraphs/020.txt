The applicant contends that the interest resulted from circumstances beyond his control. Examples of such circumstances can be found in the IC 92-2: human or natural disasters, civil disturbances or disruptions in services such as postal strike, and serious emotional or mental distress such as death in the immediate family. While the circumstances outlined in IC 92-2 are non-exhaustive, there is no indication that the applicant submitted to Revenue Canada evidence that he experienced such circumstances. The applicant's contention is unsubstantiated. The circumstances invoked by the applicant, such as payment in full for the 1994, 1995 and 1996 taxation years and the delays in informing him of the amount owing, do not fall, I am satisfied, within the meaning of "circumstances beyond a taxpayer's control" under s. 220.(3.1) of the
Act
