In my opinion, the applicant's argument that the Minister failed to consider all the information that was submitted must fail. The applicant's contention seems to flow from a series of disagreements with respect to allowable deductions and expenses, for example, the applicant argues that exterior paint claimed as a current expense was not allowed because the revised detailed expense statement submitted by the applicant was not accepted by Revenue Canada. It appears that the applicant's argument relates mostly to the assessment of his returns for the 1994, 1995 and 1996 taxation years. The assessment of the applicant's income tax returns is not under review. I have no jurisdiction to review the respondent's reassessment of the applicant's tax returns in the present proceedings.
