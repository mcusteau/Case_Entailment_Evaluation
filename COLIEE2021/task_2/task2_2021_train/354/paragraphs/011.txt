In a judicial review application of the Minister's decision pursuant to s. 220.(3.1) of the
Income Tax Act
, the Federal Court is concerned with the legality of the decision under review which includes compliance with principles of natural justice and fairness. It is clearly established that the court is not competent to vary or amend Revenue Canada's assessment of interest payable by the applicant:
Floyd Estate v. Minister of National Revenue
(1993), 68 F.T.R. 157 (T.D.). In
Floyd
, supra, which was cited with approval in
Bourgeois v. Revenue Canada
(1996), 96 D.T.C. 6304 (F.C.T.D.), Justice Dub√© states at p. 159:
"At the outset, I should point out that it is not for the court to decide whether the interest otherwise payable by the taxpayer ought to be waived or cancelled. It is within the discretion of the Minister. The function of the court in this judicial review, as I understand it, is to determine whether or not the Minister failed to observe procedural fairness or erred in law in making his decision, as outlined under s. 18.1(4) of the
Federal Court Act
."
