The Minister submits that the purpose of s. 220.(3.1) of the
Act
is to allow Revenue Canada to administer the tax system more fairly in dealing with taxpayers who, because of personal misfortune or circumstances beyond their control, are unable to meet the deadlines or comply with tax legislation. In this context, the minister's duty to act fairly requires that the Minister give the person the opportunity to make submissions and that all evidence presented be considered. In coming to a determination with respect to the cancellation of the interest, Mr. Beaulac considered the criteria set out in IC 92-2, as well as the fact that the respondent did not give erroneous directions to the applicant, that the accumulation of interest was not due to the negligence, fault or misrepresentation of the respondent, and that the applicant did not demonstrate undue financial hardship justifying the cancellation of interest. Furthermore, the assessment of the applicant's tax returns for 1994, 1995 and 1996 were done in the normal reassessment period and the accumulation of interest does not arise from the Minister's actions.
