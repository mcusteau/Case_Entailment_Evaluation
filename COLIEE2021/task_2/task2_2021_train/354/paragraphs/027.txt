In the case of
Baron et al. v. Minister of National Revenue
(1997), 209 N.R. 392; 97 D.T.C. 5121 (F.C.A.), a case very similar to the case at bar, in that it deals with a discretionary decision of the Minister, Mr. Justice Pratte states at p. 5122:
"Before saying why we think that these findings are wrong, it may be useful to recall that subsection 152(4.2) of the
Income Tax Act
confers a discretion on the Minister and that, when an application for judicial review is directed against a decision made in the exercise of a discretion, the reviewing court is not called upon to exercise the discretion conferred on the person who made the decision. The court may intervene and set aside the discretionary decision under review only if that decision was made in bad faith, if its author clearly ignored some relevant facts or took into consideration irrelevant facts or if the decision is contrary to law."
