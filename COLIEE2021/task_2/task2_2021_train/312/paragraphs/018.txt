Since there are three inconsistencies between the applicant's citizenship application and the passport, it was open to the judge to find that he could not rely on the passport evidence. However, the judge had to have some specific information in order to draw that conclusion. The decision that the passport did not include the necessary evidence to determine how many days the applicant was in Canada over four years is therefore erroneous.
Did the judge err in finding that the applicant did not have an adequate knowledge of Canada and the responsibilities and privileges of Canadian citizenship?
