Since I am reviewing an order which was not made by me, it is well established that the hearing before me is de novo as to both the law and the facts involved in the matter. As Mr. Justice Teitelbaum indicated in
Proctor & Gamble Inc. et al. v. John Doe et al.
, [1997] F.C.J. No. 1261; 138 F.T.R. 250 (T.D.), quoting Mr Justice Smith from the British Columbia Court of Appeal in
Gulf Islands Navigation Ltd. v. Seafarers' International Union
(1959), 18 D.L.R.(2d) 625 (B.C.C.A.):
"if the second judge hears the motion, he should hear it de novo as to both the law and facts involved."
