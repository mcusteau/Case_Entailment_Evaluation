An Anton Piller type order is an extraordinary equitable relief granted by the court. The court routinely imposes, as a term of this extraordinary relief, that the matter come back before the court so that it can review the conduct of the moving party in connection with the extraordinary relief. This affords the court the opportunity to ensure that moving party has discharged its obligation to ensure that any order which is obtained is fairly executed.
