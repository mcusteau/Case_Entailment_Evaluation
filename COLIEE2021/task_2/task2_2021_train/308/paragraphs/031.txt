As noted by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Indian Manufacturing Ltd. et al. v. Lo et al.
(1998), 215 N.R. 76; 75 C.P.R.(3d) 339 (F.C.A.), at 341-342 [C.P.R.]:
"An Anton Piller order takes its name from that of the plaintiff in
Anton Piller KG v. Manufacturing Processes Ltd.
, [1976] 1 Ch. 55, a decision of the English Court of Appeal. The purpose of such an order is to preserve property as to which there is strong prima facie evidence that it consists of articles infringing the plaintiff's copyright, trade-mark or other rights. The order is obtained ex parte because the essence of the exercise of judicial power 'is surprise, so that the defendant should not have advance knowledge of the application or the order and so have the opportunity of destroying or disposing of relevant materials or documents'."
