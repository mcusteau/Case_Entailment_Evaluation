The Anton Piller order prohibits the destruction of unlicensed copies of software by the defendants. That interlocutory order was continued, on consent of the parties, by order made on January 13, 1998. This injunction prohibited McArthur Thompson from destroying evidence which might be used against it in the course of this action.
