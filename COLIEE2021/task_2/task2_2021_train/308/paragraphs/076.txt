472. Q. But it's not just a question of having that in doubt. You say -- you aver under oath that there's a strong possibility that they would destroy and erase.
A. Yes.
473. Q. A strong possibility.
A. Yes.
474. Q. Okay. And what is the basis of that?
A. I believe that -- I don't really know how to answer the question. I mean, it's ---
