On the evidence before me, I find that the plaintiffs did not make sufficient inquiries of additional facts, before obtaining the order, in order to establish the existence of the third condition for the granting of an Anton Piller order. They did not further inquire into the credibility of their sole informant and did not further inquire into the business reputation of the moving party.
