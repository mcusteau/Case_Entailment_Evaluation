Regarding the requirement of damages, actual or potential, of a serious nature, the plaintiffs submit that software piracy is a significant problem for the plaintiffs and other software publishers. Approximately 42% of all copies of computer software in Canada have been made without authorization. This scale of illegitimate copying of computer programs deters investment in new products and technologies, contributes to higher prices and hurts consumers. Piracy of the sort engaged in by the defendants, known as "softlifting", is the most prevalent form of piracy worldwide and in Canada. As such, it is particularly threatening and harmful to copyright owners. After receiving and investigating the report from Mr. Younger, the plaintiffs decided to commence this action and to assert their legal rights in respect of their copyright in software programs.
