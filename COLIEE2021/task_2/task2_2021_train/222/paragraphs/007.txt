 [7] 
  In his application for leave and for judicial review and memorandum of fact and law, the applicant raised three issues: 
 
 
 
 1. Whether the immigration officer breached principles of fairness in failing to issue adequate reasons; 
 
 
 
 2. Whether the officer erred in rendering an unreasonable decision; 
 
 
 
 3. Whether the applicant was denied natural justice and fairness through the incompetence of his counsel.
