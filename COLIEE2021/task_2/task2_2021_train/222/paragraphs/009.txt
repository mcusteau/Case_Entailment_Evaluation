 [9] 
  As stated by Justice Max M. Teitelbaum in Shirvan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1509, [2005] F.C.J. No. 1864 (QL) the test for incompetent counsel is very high. The party making the allegation of incompetence must show substantial prejudice to the individual and that prejudice must flow from the actions or inaction of the incompetent counsel. It must be shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would be different.
