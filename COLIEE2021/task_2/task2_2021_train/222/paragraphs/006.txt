  In her file notes the officer reviewed Mr. Jeffrey's history in Canada and the evidence of establishment submitted in 2003 and 2005. She then concluded as follows: 
 
 
 
 I make a negative decision in this case. While I note he works and has taken continuing education, he has been under removal from Canada since April 2003, and should have effected his removal at that time. As per foss [sic] he is no longer married to his landed immigrant wife. He has a mother and daughter in Grenada and only a sister in Canada. Establishment on it's [sic] own is insufficient grounds to warrant a waiver from the exemption of legislative requirements. While he appears to be working in Canada, he appeared to be working 3 years prior to coming to Canada in Grenada. He has provided very little information and or evidence. Based on the evidence before me I find there to be insufficient evidence to warrant the waiver in this case. This application is refused.
