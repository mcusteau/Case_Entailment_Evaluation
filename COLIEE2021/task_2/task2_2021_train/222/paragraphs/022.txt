 [22] 
  As stated by Justice Sexton, in Via Rail at para.21, the duty to give reasons is only fulfilled if the reasons provided are adequate. What constitutes adequate reasons is a matter to be determined in light of the particular circumstances of each case. As a general rule, Justice Sexton noted, adequate reasons are those that serve the functions for which the duty to provide them was imposed. At paragraph 22 of his reasons he added the following comments: 
 
 
 
 The obligation to provide adequate reasons is not satisfied by merely reciting the submissions and evidence of the parties and stating a conclusion. Rather, the decision maker must set out its findings of fact and the principal evidence upon which those findings were based. The reasons must address the major points in issue. The reasoning process followed by the decision maker must be set out and must reflect consideration of the main relevant factors. [Footnotes omitted].
