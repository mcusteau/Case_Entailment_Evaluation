  The applicant submits that the officer erred in failing to issue adequate reasons for her decision. In particular, it is submitted, she failed to identify why she came to the conclusion that the applicant would not suffer "undue, undeserved or disproportionate hardship" if his application were refused. The Officer merely reviews the facts as put forward in the applicant's application, then states that " 
 [e] stablishment on it's [sic] own is insufficient grounds to warrant a waiver from the exemption of legislative requirements. 
 " That underlined statement, the applicant submits, should be ground in itself for a finding of reversible error as a misapprehension of the test for H & C consideration. Evidence of establishment may be sufficient to demonstrate undue hardship in some circumstances.
