  In effect, the Applicants characterize the 10-day period they spent in the United States as being "in transit" to Canada and that this time period does not amount to a sojourn by the terms of the  
 Immigration Act 
 . In this regard, they refer to a decision of this Court,  
 El Jechi v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1988), 25 F.T.R. 196 (T.D.), where it was held that a one-night stay in the United States did not constitute sojourning, but was simply "'passing through' the United States in order to arrive at the Canadian border" ( p. 198). In arriving at his decision, Teitelbaum, J., suggested that an applicant's intention is relevant in determining whether s/he did in fact sojourn in the United States: "I can only conclude from the uncontradicted facts given in evidence that it was the intention of the applicants to travel  
 through 
  part of the United States to reach the Canadian border where they would claim refugee status" (p. 198, emphasis in original). Further, the fact that the applicants in  
 El Jechi 
  stayed in the United States only one night and took the first available flight the following day convinced the Court that "the applicants had no intention to sojourn in the United States nor any intention to remain in the United States more than was absolutely necessary, that is, one night" (198).
