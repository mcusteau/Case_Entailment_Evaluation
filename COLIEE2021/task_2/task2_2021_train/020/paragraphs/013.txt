  Further, I find support for the view that the Applicants will not suffer irreparable harm if removed to the United States in the decision of Simpson, J., in  
 Calderon v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (1995), 92 F.T.R. 107 (T.D.), at 111, where the learned judge says: 
 
 
 
 "In  
 Kerrutt v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1992), 53 F.T.R. 93 (F.C.T.D.), Mr. Justice MacKay concluded that, for the purposes of a stay application, irreparable harm implies the serious likelihood of jeopardy to an applicant's life or safety. This is a very strict test and I accept its premise that irreparable harm must be very grave and more than the unfortunate hardship associated with the breakup or relocation of the family." 
 
 
 
 The evidence adduced by the Applicants does not demonstrate that there is a serious likelihood of jeopardy to their life or safety. In this regard, I also agree with this Court's decision in  
 Karthigesu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1998] F.C.J. No. 1038; 153 F.T.R. 205 (T.D.), which held that being detained in the United States, does not in itself, constitute irreparable harm.
