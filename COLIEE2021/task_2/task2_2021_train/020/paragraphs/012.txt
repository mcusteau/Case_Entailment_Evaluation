  Even if the Applicants were detained, I am not convinced that this would constitute irreparable harm. Irreparable harm is not mere inconvenience or financial or emotional hardship. [see footnote 7] As MacKay, J., indicated in  
 Boquoi v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1993), 67 F.T.R. 232 (T.D.), at paragraph 13: 
 
 
 
 "Difficult as the circumstances may appear to the applicants if they are required to leave Canada, their circumstances do not constitute irreparable harm as that has come to be defined by jurisprudence. Mere economic dislocation or difficulties or inconvenience do not constitute irreparable harm in circumstances where, at the time, neither applicant has a right to remain in Canada."
