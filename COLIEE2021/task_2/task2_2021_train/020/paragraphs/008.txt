  The Applicants qualify their stay in the United States as being "in transit" to Canada. I cannot accept this argument. An individual cannot remain in transit for ten days. Taken to its logical conclusion, this argument would mean than an individual could stay in the United States for any given period of time and then claim that s/he was not sojourning because s/he never intended to stay but was simply passing through.
