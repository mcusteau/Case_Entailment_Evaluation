  In my view, none of these definitions suggest that intention is a component of sojourning. At best, the most that can be said about one's "intention" in sojourning is that it is necessarily temporary; that is, one intends to stay at a particular place temporarily. Accordingly, I cannot see how it can be argued that the Applicants did not sojourn in the United States because they only intended to stay temporarily. Even on their own argument, the United States was a "digression" or "stopoff" to Canada, and therefore, a sojourn by the terms expressed in the previous paragraph.
