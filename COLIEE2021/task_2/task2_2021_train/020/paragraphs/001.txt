 Nadon, J. 
 : This is a motion for a stay of the execution of the Applicants' removal to the United States scheduled to take place on March 30, 2000. The Applicants submit that a statutory stay applies pursuant to clause 49(1)(c)(i) [see footnote 1] of the  
 Immigration Act 
  and therefore, that the Minister's Removal Order is illegal since their application for leave to commence judicial review proceedings in the Federal Court, which was filed on October 20, 1999, has not yet been disposed of.
