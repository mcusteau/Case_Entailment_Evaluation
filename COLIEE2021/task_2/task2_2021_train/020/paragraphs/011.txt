  On the question of irreparable harm, the Applicants argue that they would face irreparable harm if they went to the United States because they would possibly be detained. In this regard, they cite a September 1998 report by Human Rights Watch entitled  
 United States--Locked Away: Immigration Detainees in Jails in the United States 
  and submit that "asylum seekers in the United States are generally detained (page 26 [of Report], first paragraph)" (paragraph 30 of Applicants' Written Representations of their Motion Record). Although the U.S.  
 Immigration and Naturalization Act 
  provides, as the Human Rights Watch Report points out, that all asylum seekers shall be detained pending a resolution of their claims, the Report also notes that people are detained "because they lack valid documents for entering or remaining in the United States; to protect public safety; to ensure their presence at ongoing immigration proceedings; or to prevent them from remaining in the United States after they have been ordered to return to their home countries" (p. 30 of Human Rights Watch Report, p. 39 of Applicants' Record). This seems to suggest that detention is limited to people seeking asylum in the United States, not in Canada. Further, I believe that none of the reasons for detention listed in the Report apply to the Applicants. Moreover, a subsequent study by Human Rights Watch [see footnote 6] suggests that detention is no longer routine and reports that case-by-case reviews have been implemented such that individuals would not be detained if they could show that they do not constitute a danger to society, that they have community ties, and would likely appear for future hearings.
