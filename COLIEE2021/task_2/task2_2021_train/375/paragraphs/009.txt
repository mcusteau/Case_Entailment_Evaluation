It is not apparent what the difference between persuasive evidence and balance on the balance of probabilities amounts to. Persuasive clearly does not refer to the criminal standard of "beyond a reasonable doubt". Any finding on the balance of probabilities is, by definition, persuasive. For instance in Li v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1934 at para. 50 Gauthier J. stated:
In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the Act, there must be
persuasive evidence (ie balance of probabilities)
establishing the facts on which a claimant relies to say that he or she faces a substantial danger of being tortured upon his or her return (emphasis added).
Similarly in Sivanathan v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2003] F.C.J. No. 662 at para. 2 Snider J. held:
On that basis, the Board had
no persuasive evidence before it to indicate, on the balance of probabilities
, that the minor Applicant was persecuted or would be persecuted, in Norway for a Convention reason (emphasis added).
Consequently the Board did not commit a reviewable error by using this term.
