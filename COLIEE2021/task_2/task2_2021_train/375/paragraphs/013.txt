The applicant alleges that the Board ignored evidence presented at the hearing. The Board accepted the documentary evidence which establishes that the Kenyan government persecuted certain groups, including groups advocating on behalf of the disabled. The Board accepted that certain groups were targeted in this way, but found that the applicant was not a member of these groups. This was the central sticking point in this case, and the applicant was unable to supply any evidence going to this crucial issue other than her own testimony. As the Board stated on page 6 of the Tribunal Record:
It is the claimant's burden to establish the bona fides of her claim. She enjoyed a singular reputation amongst the disabled community in Kenya because of her design and manufacture of a unique wheelchair. I find it unreasonable to believe that if she were involved in activism on behalf of disabled groups that there not be persons or organisations who would know and would be willing to assist her in her refugee claim. The panel draws a negative inference on the credibility of the claimant in not placing before the panel concrete evidence of her activism. That there would not be any individual or other activist person or organisation willing to support the claimant's contention is not credible.
