Given that the Respondent remains a security risk whom the Minister has not had sufficient opportunity to investigate to determine the extent of his involvement with the LTTE, his release into the community will cause real and non-speculative irreparable harm. Moreover, the Respondent is a danger to the public if released on minimal terms and conditions including a patent lack of supervision in the community by a surety. Releasing the Respondent directly prevents the Minister's efforts to ensure his availability for future proceedings - including a possible admissibility hearing; furthermore, it prevents him from carrying out his mandate of protecting the public and undermines the safety and security of the Canadian public
