  Four months after her arrival and as part of the visa renewal process, the Respondent had a medical examination, which included a blood test. The test results were acceptable and the visa was renewed. The visa continued to be renewed periodically for some considerable time. The Respondent maintains that she mistakenly thought that the blood test she took for her visa renewal included an HIV test. Because the visa was renewed she claims that she thought, again mistakenly, that the HIV- positive result in Hong Kong was an error.
