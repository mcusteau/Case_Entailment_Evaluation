  The second issue raised by the Ministers is the Board's error regarding the danger that the Respondent represents for the public. The Board member had evidence before him that the Respondent was convicted of two serious offences. The Board member also had evidence before him that the Respondent intentionally infected her husband (mens rea was required for a conviction on both counts). At the 7-day detention review hearing, the adjudicator specifically noted that the Respondent was not credible when she was alleging that she did not know about her HIV infection.
