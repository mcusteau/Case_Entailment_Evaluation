I would take this opportunity to reiterate what I had said in
Wassiq
, supra, about asylum shopping because those observations are applicable to what the applicants have attempted to do in this case. At page 241 of
Wassiq
, I stated:
"I would observe that if, by reason of their absence from Germany and sojourn in Canada, the applicants are, in effect, entitled to renounce the protection they received from Germany and claim protection from Canada, such a result is anomalous. In substance, it gives persons who have Convention refugee status in one country the right to emigrate to another country without complying with the usual requirements, solely by reason of their unilateral renunciation of the protection initially given to them by the first country. In effect, this means that they can 'asylum shop' amongst countries who are signatories to the
Geneva Convention
and 'queue jump' normal immigration waiting lists to the country of their choice. If this is the case, the applicants, who resided in Germany for ten years, may simply abandon Germany for Canada. They would have greater rights to emigrate to Canada than persons of German nationality. That is neither fair nor logical."
