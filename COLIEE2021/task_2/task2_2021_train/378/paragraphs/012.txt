The applicants rely on
Wassiq
, supra. However, the facts in that case are quite different. In
Wassiq
there was evidence that the applicants had been advised by the German government that they could not return. In this case, the applicants provided no such evidence. Once the respondent submitted prima facie evidence which would enable the panel to conclude that the applicants could return to France, the onus shifted to the applicants to show they could not. The applicants have not satisfied that onus.
