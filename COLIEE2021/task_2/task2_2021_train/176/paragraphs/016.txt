  The Board relied on the following facts to arrive at its decision: 
 
 
 
 -	The police went to the applicants' home and drafted a report on the antisemitic incidents they had experienced, but were unable to arrest the perpetrators. 
 
 
 
 -	The U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices for 1992 suggests that the Russian government does not condone or support anti-semitism. 
 
 
 
 -	The male applicant did not approach the police after the last attack because members of Pamyat warned him not to do so.
