  In my view, the Board erred in two respects. Firstly, while the Board stated the correct test regarding state protection, the evidence it used in its analysis did not address the state's ability to offer effective protection. Secondly, the Board erred when it ignored several discriminatory incidents instead of viewing them as a series of events that could amount to persecution.
