 [5] 
  On Passover, the female applicant was returning to her apartment when she was attacked by a Pamyat member who saw her carrying the Passover Matzo. The Pamyat member bombarded her with anti-semitic insults. The female applicant did not go to the police. She and her husband were far too intimidated to do so since, at the time of the assault, they were both told not to go anywhere for help. They were told at that time that there was no one to help them, and that they should do as Pamyat said and leave Russia.
