  The  
 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1992 
  (U.S. Dept. of State (February 1993)) discussed the expression of anti-semitism in Russia: 
 
 
 
 "Anti-semitism continues to exist among the population, however and was evident in political expression. Anti-government demonstrators advocating a return to Soviet-era policies and practices often used anti-semitic imagery, brandishing placards calling President Yeltsin a Jew and effigies decorated with the Star of David or swastikas. The openly nationalist organization Pamyat continued to propagate anti-semitic ideas in its own newspaper, one of 30 Russian publications containing Fascist and anti-semitic material. ... Members of the organization paraded freely in Moscow." 
 
 
 
 Anti-semitism may not receive official sponsorship from the government, but the evidence indicates that it continues to thrive in parts of Russia.
