  It is an error of law for the Board not to consider the cumulative nature of the persecution of a claimant. A trilogy of cases from the Court of Appeal indicates that it is improper to ignore evidence that in itself does not constitute persecution, but forms part of a pattern of persecution. MacGuigan, J., clearly stated this principle in  
 Retnem v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  [see footnote 1]: 
 
 
 
 "In other words, he [the applicant] made an argument that the cumulative acts of harassment by the authorities amounted to persecution in the sense of the refugee Convention. This is an argument which found favour with this court in  
 Mirza Beglui v. M.E.I. 
 , A-538-89, decided January 28, 1991 [Please see [1991] F.C.J. No. 50]. I would also refer to the Reasons for Decision of Thurlow, C.J., and  
 Oyarzo v. M.E.I. 
 , [1982] 2 F.C. 779 at 781: 
 
 
 
 'Since it is the foundation for a present fear that must be considered, such incidents in the past are part of the whole future and cannot be discarded entirely as the basis for a fear, even though what has happened since has left them in the background.' 
 
 
 
 "Hence, even though the claimant did not flee the country for some years after his two week detention and torture in 1984, that incident is still current as a basis for fear when linked with all of the smaller previous and subsequent harassment he endured. In my opinion, the Board's failure to deal with the cumulative nature of the persecution the applicant alleged is a patent error of law."
