  The applicants are faced with a situation where the author of the harassment directed against them is not the state. In  
 Ward v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689; 153 N.R. 321, the Supreme Court of Canada decided that in such a situation the key issue is the ability of the state to protect its citizens and not its participation in their persecution: 
 
 
 
 "In summary, I find that state complicity is not a necessary component of persecution, either under the 'unwilling' or under the 'unable' branch of the definition. A subjective fear of persecution combined with state inability to protect the claimant creates a presumption that the fear is wellfounded."
