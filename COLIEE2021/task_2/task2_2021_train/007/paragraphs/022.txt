 What is the appropriate standard of review? 
 
 
 
 In my opinion, the issue of whether or not paragraph 40(1)(a) includes situations whereby an applicant adopts a misrepresentation, but clarifies it prior to a decision being rendered on the application is a question of pure statutory interpretation. The appropriate standard of review for questions of statutory interpretation is correctness. If the officer's interpretation was correct, then a second issue follows: does paragraph 40(1)(a) apply to the facts of this case? This section issue is a question of mixed fact and law and is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness.
