 Did the officer make a reviewable error in interpreting the paragraph 40(1)(a) to include situations where the applicant adopts a misrepresentation, but clarifies it prior to a decision being rendered on the application? 
 
 
 
 Before I consider this issue, I feel it necessary to note that the applicant does not take issue with the ultimate refusal of the application, but yet with the finding of misrepresentation under paragraph 40(1)(a). The applicant submitted that paragraph 40(1)(a) does not apply to situations where the misrepresentation is corrected before a decision on the application was made. The respondent submitted that paragraph 40(1)(a) applies to misrepresentations even if it is clarified by the applicant before the decision is rendered. Thus, the question is whether the correct interpretation of paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Act applies to situations where a misrepresentation in an application is clarified before a decision on the matter is rendered.
