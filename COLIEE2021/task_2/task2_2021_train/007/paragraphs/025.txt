 [25] 
  Paragraph 40(1)(a) is written very broadly in that it applies to any misrepresentation, whether direct or indirect, relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of the Act. I am of the opinion that this Court must respect the wording of the Act and give it the broad interpretation its wording demands. There is nothing in the wording of the paragraph indicating that it should not apply to a situation where a misrepresentation is adopted, but clarified prior to a decision being rendered.
