  The weight of the jurisprudence as expressed by Justice Létourneau in Francosteel Canada Inc. v. African Cape (The) (C.A.), [2003] 4 F.C. 284, 2003 FCA 119, followed by Justice Pelletier, as he then was, in Halford v. Seed Hawk Inc., 2004 FC 1259 (F.T.D.) and Justice Tremblay-Lamer in Gélinas c. Centre d'analyse des opérations et déclarations financières du Canada, 2005 CF 478, recognize that there are two conditions precedent for a defendant to obtain double costs. The offer must be in writing and the offer must not have been revoked, that is, it must have remained open up to the date of the judgment.
