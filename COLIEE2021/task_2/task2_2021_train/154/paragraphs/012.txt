 [12] 
  I accept counsel for the defendants' statement in paragraph 12 of his affidavit that the offer to settle was renewed during trial but I understood him during the teleconference to say that it was revoked during trial, that is, had to be accepted before the defence called its witnesses. In any event, that continued offer to settle was not made in writing.
