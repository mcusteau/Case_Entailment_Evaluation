In summary, I have been guided by two principles in the assessment of costs against the defendant Musadiq Pardhan. First, in matters of contempt, the plaintiff may be awarded reasonable costs, on a solicitor and client basis. Second, the imposition of costs should not result in undue punishment and, I would add, particularly where the order violated has been found to be invalid. I have been given no evidence concerning the current financial situation of Musadiq Pardhan to appreciate better what may constitute undue punishment in this case. I have also considered the plaintiffs' offer to settle, in accordance with rule 400(3)(e), keeping in mind that it was not accepted during the limited period that it was open for acceptance.
