The contumacious acts, with respect to which Musadiq Pardhan was found guilty, were committed prior to the coming into force of the
Federal Court Rules, 1998
, SOR/98-106. Accordingly, both parties acknowledge that the applicable penalty is set out in rule 355 of the former
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663. Rule 355(2) stated:
"355(2) Except where otherwise provided, anyone who is guilty of contempt of court is liable to a fine, which in the case of an individual shall not exceed $5,000, or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. Imprisonment, and in the case of a corporation, a fine, for refusal to obey any process or order may be repeatedly inflicted until the person condemned obeys."
"355(2) Sauf disposition contraire, quiconque est coupable d'outrage au tribunal est passible d'une amende qui, dans le cas d'un particulier ne doit pas dépasser 5 000 $ ou d'un emprisonnement d'un an au plus. L'emprisonnement et, dans le cas d'une corporation, une amende, pour refus d'obéissance à un bref ou une ordonnance, peuvent être renouvelés jusqu'à ce que la personne condamnée obéisse."
In this case, therefore, Mr. Pardhan is subject to a fine not to exceed $5,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year. Under rule 472 of the
Federal Court Rules, 1998
, SOR/98-106, there is no specified limit to the fine which may be imposed and the person found to be in contempt may be imprisoned for a period of less than five (5) years.
