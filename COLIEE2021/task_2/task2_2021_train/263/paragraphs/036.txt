I am fortified in reaching this conclusion by the similar views expressed by Lutfy, J., in
Young Drivers
, supra, even though on the facts of that case he did not find it necessary to reach a definitive conclusion on the issue. He said:
"If the issue of confusion can properly be characterised as a matter of mixed law and fact, the standard of review may be further down the spectrum from correctness. The special knowledge and expertise of the Registrar may require greater deference, where no new evidence is adduced on appeal. The determination on appeal may be closer to whether the Registrar's decision is 'clearly wrong' or 'unreasonable'."
