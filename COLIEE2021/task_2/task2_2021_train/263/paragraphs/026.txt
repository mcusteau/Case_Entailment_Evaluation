Noting that the statutory designation of the appeal as de novo empowered the District Court to admit evidence that was not before the Board, Martland, J., nonetheless held (at pages 527-528 [S.C.R.]) that the fact that the first-level decision-maker was a specialized tribunal was relevant to determining the appellate court's role under the statutory scheme:
"The appeal is from a tribunal which, in dealing with compensation claims throughout the province, acquires an expertise in these matters. The appeal is to a District Court judge, at the judicial centre nearest to the land in question, who is not a specialist in these matters. He hears evidence, and, it may be, fresh evidence. He can assess the credibility of the witnesses, but in determining land values, the adverse effect on other land resulting from the right of entry and compensation for nuisance, he should have some regard for the opinion of the Board."
I would note that, while the appeal from the Registrar to the court has often been described as de novo, this is not a term that is found in the
Trade-marks Act
itself in this context.
