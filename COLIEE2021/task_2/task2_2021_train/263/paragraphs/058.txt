The Registrar's conclusion on the lack of inherent distinctiveness of the respondent's proposed mark was not challenged on appeal. As for the additional evidence of Greta Garbo's continuing fame in Canada, the issue is whether the respondent's mark has acquired distinctiveness in connection with the wares for which it is claimed. The Registrar found on the evidence before him that it had not, and the additional evidence does not demonstrate that his conclusion was wrong.
