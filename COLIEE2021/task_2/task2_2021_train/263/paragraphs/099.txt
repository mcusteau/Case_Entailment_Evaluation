While the Registrar found in favour of the appellant on most of the criteria listed in s. 6(5), namely, the distinctiveness of the marks, the extent to which they were known and the duration of their use, they were not such as clearly to indicate that confusion was likely. Rather, much of the Registrar's analysis was a comparison of how the parties fared on the relevant criteria. The additional evidence on the overlap of the channels of trade was insufficient to satisfy me that the Registrar's decision was wrong, particularly in light of the evidence of Ms. Barham.
