Administrative decision-makers under the
Trade-marks Act
have regular exposure to the likelihood of confusion between actual and proposed trade marks in a wide range of commercial contexts. Experience of this kind is calculated to make for consistent and informed decisions. The Registrar and the assistants to whom decision-making power has been delegated also make their decisions on the basis of a hearing of a broadly adjudicative nature. On the other hand, it is also true that courts are not unfamiliar with the closely related issues that arise in passing-off cases and the related causes of action codified and modified in s. 7 of the
Trade-marks Act
.
