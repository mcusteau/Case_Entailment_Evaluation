The standard of patent unreasonableness has been equated by the Supreme Court of Canada to a decision that is "clearly irrational" or "evidently not in accordance with reason", so flawed that no amount of curial deference can justify letting it stand: Law Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247 at para. 52. In Voice Construction Ltd. v. C.G.W.U., [2004] 1 S.C.R. 609 at para. 18, the Supreme Court said that to be patently unreasonable, the decision must be so clearly wrong that "the result must almost border on the absurd."
Were the Findings of Fact Patently Unreasonable?
