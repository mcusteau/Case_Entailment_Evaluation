The Tribunal record contains the table of contents for the Refugee Protection Division information package on Colombia but does not include reproductions of any of the individual reports. The applicant's submissions include several of these reports. Highlighted portions of the evidence in the applicant's record indicate, for example, that persons who left Columbia and returned have been killed even after a period of months or years.
