It is well settled that the fact that all documentary evidence is not mentioned in the Board's reasons is neither fatal to its decision nor does it indicate that the panel failed to consider certain evidence: Woolaston v. Canada (Minister of Manpower and Immigration), [1973] S.C.R. 102 at 108; Hassan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 147 N.R. 317 at 319 (F.C.A.). The Board is presumed to have weighed and considered all of the submitted evidence until the presumption is rebutted: Florea v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] F.C.J. No. 598 (F.C.A.) (QL).
