The applicant submits that the Board erred in concluding that her evidence as to why she did not make a claim in the United States was vague and asserts that she provided plausible explanations for the delay. It is well settled that delay in making a refugee claim is an important factor which the Board may consider in weighing a claim for refugee protection: Heer v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1988] F.C.J. No. 330 (QL). In this case, a delay of over four years suggests a lack of a subjective fear of persecution and it was open to the Board to reject the applicant's explanations. The applicant, in effect, is asking the Court to make its own assessment of her reasons and substitute its opinion for that of the Board. Unless the finding was patently unreasonable, which I do not find, there is no basis for the Court's intervention.
Did the Board Ignore Documentary Evidence?
