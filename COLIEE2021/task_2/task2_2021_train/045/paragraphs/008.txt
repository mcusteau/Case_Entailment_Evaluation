 [8] 
  The Officer's analysis of the "best interests of the child" is legally flawed. The Officer distorted the analysis and applied the wrong legal test by imposing the burden of showing "disproportionate hardship" rather than the "best interests" test mandated by  
 Hawthorne v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , 2002 FCA 475. 
 
 
 
 While the ultimate question in an H&C application is "disproportionate hardship", the "best interests" analysis operates as a separate consideration. The Officer's failure to keep the two issues distinct results in an unreasonable assessment of the children's best interests.
