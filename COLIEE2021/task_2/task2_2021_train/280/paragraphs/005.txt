The Applicant argues that the RPD made three reviewable errors in its Decision, alleging that:
a. The RPD's identity finding was unreasonable;
b. The RPD's general conclusion regarding the Applicant's lack of credibility was unreasonable because it centred on the implausibility of the PSB serving a warrant. The Applicant argues that there was evidence in the record to indicate that the PSB procedures were not standardized and, therefore, the Board's implausibility conclusion was unreasonable; and
c. The RPD's reliance on the lack of documented evidence of persecution of Christians in the Guangxi Province was unreasonable because the documentary evidence established that censorship is rampant in China.
