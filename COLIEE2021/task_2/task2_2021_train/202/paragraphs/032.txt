  In  
 Caliskan 
 , Justice Hughes found that the officer improperly focused on the risks faced by the applicant and not on the hardship, as required in section 25. He then certified a question on the nature of the risks to be considered under section 25 as amended: 
 
 
 
 [26] I find that the Reasons improperly focus on risk and embark on an exercise of distinguishing personalized from generalized risk, which should not be done. The focus should be on hardship, including any adverse country conditions that have a direct negative impact on the applicant. The matter will be sent back for redetermination by a different Officer, having these principles in mind. 
 
 
 
 [27] I recognize that this case raises a new issue not considered by earlier jurisprudence and will certify the following question: 
 
 
 
 What is the nature of risk, if any, to be assessed with respect to humanitarian and compassionate considerations under section 25 of IRPA, as amended by the Balanced Refugee Reform Act?
