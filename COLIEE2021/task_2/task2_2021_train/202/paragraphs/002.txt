  The applicant then made an application for a Pre-removal Risk Assessment [PRRA] and an application on Humanitarian and Compassionate [H&C] grounds, pursuant to subsection 25(1) of the  
 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
 , SC 2001, c 27 (the  
 Act 
 ) to permit him to apply for permanent resident status from within Canada. Both applications were refused in January, 2012. The applicant did not pursue leave for judicial review of the PRRA decision due to an agreement by the respondent to reconsider the H&C application.
