  As the Officer notes in her reasons, the H&C process permits an exemption from applying for permanent residence from outside of Canada. It is an exceptional provision to be exercised where there is unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The Officer assessed all the factors and made the appropriate distinction between an assessment of risk, which was conducted for the PRRA, and an assessment of hardship which is required for H&C determinations. The Officer acknowledged general adverse conditions for Tamil males in Sri Lanka but reasonably found that there was insufficient evidence that the applicant had any profile that would result in him being targeted and insufficient evidence that he would be directly negatively impacted. The Officer supported her assessment and decision with clear reasons. There is no basis to disturb those findings.
