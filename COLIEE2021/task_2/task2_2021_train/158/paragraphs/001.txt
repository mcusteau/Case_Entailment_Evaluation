 Layden-Stevenson, J. 
 : The applicant is a 36-year-old Fijian citizen. As an ethnic Indo-Fijian and a practicing Hindu, she claimed to fear persecution from native Fijians on the basis of her ethnicity and religious identity. She sought protection under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (IRPA). The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board rejected her claim. At the conclusion of the hearing of her application for judicial review, I informed the parties that I would allow the application. These are my reasons for doing so.
