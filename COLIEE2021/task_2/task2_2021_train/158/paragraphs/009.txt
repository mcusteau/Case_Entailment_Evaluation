  The RPD also referred to a 2004 United States Department of State (DOS) Report to support its finding of state protection. At page 2 of its reasons, the RPD stated that “documentary evidence indicates that Fiji has a police service and that it investigates and prosecutes even their own members for abuses of human rights”. Here, the difficulty is that the quoted reference related to the issue of police brutality and the abuse of apprehended persons and prisoners. The section of the DOS Report that reported on the issue of racial and ethnic discrimination suggested that the prosecution of native Fijian land-owners who discriminate against Indo-Fijians is rarely successful.
