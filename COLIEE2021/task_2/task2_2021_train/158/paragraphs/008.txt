  Specifically, the RPD found that the documentary evidence “indicates that racial tensions are common but that where there is evidence of destruction of property the police have investigated them”. In support of that determination, the RPD cited a Response to Information Request dated June 14, 2000. The problem is that the research relied upon by the RPD pre-dates the May 2000 coup and is antecedent to the incidents described by the applicant. A Response to Information Request subsequent to the one cited by the RPD addressed the fall-out of the May 2000 coup. It stated that the attacks against the ethnic Indian Fijians continued after the military took power and that the police did little or nothing to stop the attacks on ethnic Indians, either before or after martial law was declared.
