  The Federal Court of Appeal nuanced this somewhat, holding that a mere refusal by the police or authorities to aid a claimant will not suffice to displace this presumption; the burden of proof on the individual increases in proportion to the democratic nature of a particular state's institutions (Kadenko v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 532 (F.C.A.)). And again, some debate has resulted in the jurisprudence surrounding the Court of Appeal's judgment (see Racz, supra for a discussion of different lines of authority).
