  What is more, and with respect to the mechanisms cited by the RPD for the applicant to try and avail of the state's protection, there is evidence that the applicant's lawyer in Costa Rica did in fact contact the Ombudsman's Office but his attempt to get the Ombudsman to intervene was met with failure. Given that the applicant's credibility was not questioned, and in the face of evidence showing that the agents of the state were the perpetrators of the applicant's persecution and that the applicant's lawyer in Costa Rica did attempt to enlist the aid of the Ombudsman's Office, I find the RPD's conclusion that the applicant made no serious attempt to seek protection unreasonable.
