  The amendment made on April 26, 2004, indicated that authority could be delegated to an officer without the latter necessarily being under the direction of the Minister in question. If any error had been possible, this amendment clarified the authority to delegate and clearly extended this authority to the officers described in sections 43.1 and 45, which clearly include the PRRA officer.
