 [20] 
  Regarding the adequacy of reasons, according to  
 Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 
  2011 SCC 62, [2011] 3 SCR 708: 
 
 
 
 Reasons need not include all the arguments or details the reviewing judge would have preferred, but that does not impugn the validity of either the reasons or the result. If the reasons allow the reviewing court to understand why the tribunal made its decision and permit it to determine whether the conclusion is within the range of acceptable outcomes, the  
 Dunsmuir 
  criteria are met.
