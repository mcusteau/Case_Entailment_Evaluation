  I am of the view that this obligation was met in this case. The panel provided detailed reasons that make it possible to specifically identify which elements its decision was based on. The applicant's mere disagreement with the panel's factual findings is not equivelent to an error of procedural fairness ( 
 Sidhu v The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2012 FC 515).
