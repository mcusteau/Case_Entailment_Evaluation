At the conclusion of this process the judge shall quash the certificate if he or she is of the opinion that it is not reasonable. If the judge does not quash the certificate and finds the certificate to be reasonable, but finds the decision on the application for protection to be not lawfully made, that latter decision is quashed and the proceedings are again suspended pending redetermination of the application for protection.

Act
