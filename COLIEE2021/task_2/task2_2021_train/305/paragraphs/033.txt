I respectfully disagree. The legislative scheme as I have described above does not lead to lesser rights for a person who is determined to be a Convention refugee and thereby given refugee protection before the issuance of a security certificate. Such a person at all times maintains their right not to be refouled unless the Minister determines, pursuant to section 115(2)(b) of the
Act
, that he or she should not be allowed to remain in Canada because of the nature and severity of acts committed, or because of danger to the security of Canada.
