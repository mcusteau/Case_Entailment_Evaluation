Thereafter, on December 10, 2002 a certificate, signed by the Minister and the Solicitor General of Canada ("security certificate" or "certificate") was referred to this Court pursuant to section 77(1) of the
Act
for determination as to whether the certificate is reasonable. The security certificate asserts that Mr. Harkat is inadmissible to Canada under sections 34(1)(c) and 34(1)(f) of the
Act
. Those paragraphs render a permanent resident or foreign national inadmissible on security grounds for engaging in terrorism, or for being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged, or will engage in terrorism. At the time the security certificate was issued Mr. Harkat was a foreign national, as defined in the
Act
, and he had not acquired permanent resident status.
