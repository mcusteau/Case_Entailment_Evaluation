Mr. Harkat also argues that it is unfair that any decision of the Minister under section 115 to remove him would be judicially reviewed, on leave, by a different judge than the designated judge. The other judge would not, it is argued, have the benefit of the complete record now before the Court. I am not satisfied that this would be the case. Any judicial review of the Minister's decision would be based upon the record before the Minister, which may be at least co-extensive with that now before the Court. Moreover, the nature of the decision on judicial review is not to substitute the Court's discretion for that of the Minister on all of the facts known to the Court. Rather, the function of the Court on judicial review is to gauge the lawfulness of the Minister's decision on the record before him or her.
