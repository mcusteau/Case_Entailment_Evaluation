The parties agree that the approach to be taken when interpreting the
Act
is that the words of the
Act
are to be read in their entire context, and in their grammatical and ordinary sense, harmoniously with the scheme of the
Act
, the object of the
Act
and the intention of Parliament. See, for example,
Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84; 280 N.R. 268, at paragraph 27.
