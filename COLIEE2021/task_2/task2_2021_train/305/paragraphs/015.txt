Mr. Harkat is, therefore, by virtue of the February 24, 1997 determination that he is a Convention refugee, a "protected person". Any application for protection now brought, being an application brought subsequent to the issuance of the security certificate, could not result in refugee protection being conferred so as to make Mr. Harkat a protected person.
