  I am satisfied that it was reasonable and necessary to have first and second counsel present at trial. Therefore, costs of a second counsel (at 50% of the rate of fist counsel) for preparation and attendance at trial are approved. I am also satisfied that reasonable travel, accommodation and related expenses for both counsel at trial and closing argument are justified and should be reimbursed.
