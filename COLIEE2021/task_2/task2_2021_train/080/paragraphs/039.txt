  In order to trigger the double costs rule, an offer must be clear and unequivocal in that the opposite party need only decide whether to accept or reject the offer ( 
 Apotex Inc. v. Syntex Pharmaceuticals 
 , [2001] FCA 137, [2001] F.C.J. No. 727 (QL), at para. 10). The offer must also contain an element of compromise (or incentive to accept) ( 
 Canadian Olympic Assn. v. Olymel, Société en commandite 
 , [2000] F.C.J. No. 1725 (QL), at para. 10). The offer must also be presented in a timely fashion such that the benefit would still be derived from the opposite party if accepted ( 
 Sammammas Compania Maritima S.A. v. Netuno (the) Action in rem against the Ship "Netuno" 
 , [1995] F.C.J. No. 1442 (QL), at paras. 30 and 31). Finally, if accepted, the offer must bring the dispute between the parties to and end ( 
 TRW 
 , supra, at p. 456).
