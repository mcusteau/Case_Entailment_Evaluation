  According to the plaintiff, the disbursements claimed by Plasticair are exaggerated. The travel fees incurred at trial by counsel, Mr. Robert H.C. MacFarlane, are almost five times the fees incurred by counsel, Ms. Christine Pallota ($5, 030.11 and 1,613.31 respectively). The costs of photocopying for the out of Court examination are also exaggerated. There is no evidence of the actual costs of each disbursement and thus Plasticair does not abide by the best evidence rule.
