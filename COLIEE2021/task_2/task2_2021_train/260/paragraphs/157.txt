Dr. Rodricks also conducted a "meta" analysis using all the acute toxicity studies done for levofloxacin, including data that was generated after the filing of the patent application, in comparison to ofloxacin (with the exception of a 380 value that was not comparable to the other data). The results showed that the meta LD
50
value for levofloxacin (254 mg/kg) is significantly
different from
ofloxacin (208 mg/kg) at the 95% confidence level (and that the confidence intervals of the two values do not overlap). (Rodricks Affidavit at paras. 85-87, AR, v. 24, Tab 34, pp. 7139-7141.)
