[199]
Mr. Oyen agreed on cross-examination that it was sufficient to provide the examiner with citations to requests for prior art; it was unnecessary to provide the documents themselves. While his opinion in his affidavit was that providing particulars of an abstract of a cited article is not tantamount to providing particulars of the cited article, he admitted on cross-examination that the citations for the full articles had in fact been provided to the examiner. Mr. Oyen further agreed that the Gerster 1987 article that had been cited in the US application was not prior art in respect of the eight claims pending before the Canadian examiner when he issued the February 23, 1989 Office Action (and was, therefore, not citable against these eight claims). Mr. Oyen, therefore, agreed that the response of the patentee, dated June 8, 1989, was correct and complete.
"Q. So on June 8, the June 8, '89 response filed by the applicant, was complete insofar as setting out prior art that was citable against the claims pending before the Examiner when the Official Action was issued, correct?
A. Yes."

(c) The Applicant and its agents acted in good faith
