A person of ordinary skill in the art (POSITA) conducts the exercise as of the publication date of the patent. This exercise is conducted in a purposive and not overly literal manner that is fair and reasonable to the patentee and the public. Patent construction should be approached "with a judicial anxiety to support a really useful invention".
