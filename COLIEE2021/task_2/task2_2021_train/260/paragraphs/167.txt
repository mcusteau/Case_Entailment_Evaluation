Dr. Myerson conducted a survey of the literature reporting the relative solubility of enantiomers and racemates available in 1985 that revealed only a very small number of enantiomers had even a 5-times increase in solubility over their corresponding racemates. Dr. Myerson's expectation was that a usual increase in solubility for an enantiomer compared with its racemate would be much less than tenfold. The Liu and Hurwitz article, relied on by Apotex, surveys the literature and gives a 5-times increase as its upper limit of observed results.
