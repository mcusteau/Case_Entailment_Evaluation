[233]
In the
Novopharm
Appeal, Justice Sharlow found:
"[40] The motivation of Daiichi to obtain the enantiomers of ofloxacin explains the activities of Dr. Hayakawa during the relevant period ... The interests and focus of other researchers in the field during the same period were not on ofloxacin at all, indicating that others skilled in the art were not motivated to work on the same problem that was occupying Dr. Hayakawa. Justice Hughes found as a fact that, during the relevant period, Daiichi was motivated to obtain levofloxacin from ofloxacin, and no one else was. That was a factual conclusion that was reasonably open to him on the record."
