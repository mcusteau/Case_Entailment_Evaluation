[124]
There are a number of other alleged prior art references that Apotex relies on as rendering the invention of the '080 patent obvious (collectively the "Other references"). As Dr. Klibanov states in his affidavit, the compounds disclosed in the Other references are even more structurally dissimilar from ofloxacin than flumequine. The information that is disclosed in the Other references would not allow a skilled person to reasonably expect that levofloxacin would have superior pharmacological properties as compared to the racemate. (Klibanov Affidavit at para. 129, AR, v. 12, Tab 17, pp. 3444-3445.)
