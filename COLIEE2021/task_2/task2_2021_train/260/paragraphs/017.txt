The two enantiomers of ofloxacin were disclosed in Japanese patent application No. 134712/85, published on June 20, 1985. This was the first disclosed isolation of the substantially pure enantiomers of levofloxacin achieved using a chemical technique called HPLC. The parties refer to this process as "Process A". It is important to note that, although Daiichi had separated ofloxacin into two enantiomers, it did not yet know which enantiomer was "R" and which was "S". In technical language, a chemist would say that Daiichi did not yet know "the absolute configuration" of each enantiomer.
