The 1978 Liu and Hurwitz article similarly establishes a fivefold difference in relative water solubility between an enantiomer and its racemate. That compound, too, was completely unrelated to ofloxacin or levofloxacin. Importantly, this article noted that a fivefold difference in relative water solubility was at the upper boundary of what had been observed. As such, a tenfold difference in relative water solubility would be highly unexpected. (Myerson Affidavit, AR, v. 22, Tab 30.)
