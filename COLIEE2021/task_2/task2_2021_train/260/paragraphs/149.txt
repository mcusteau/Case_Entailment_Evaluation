Apotex alleges that the toxicity results described within the '080 patent are "not at all of practical significance for pharmaceutical formulation purposes." Apotex also suggests that the testing provided in the '080 patent was "inappropriate and/or did not demonstrate any significant difference between ofloxacin and levofloxacin." These allegations are not supported by the evidence and cannot be justified. (NOA p. 26, Klibanov Affidavit Ex. B, AR, v. 12, Tab 17, p. 3514.)
