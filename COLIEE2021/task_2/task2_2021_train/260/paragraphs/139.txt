Dr. Gerster is a named inventor of both the '609 Patent and the '651 Patent. Both of these patents are listed among the Flumequine references relied upon by Apotex in support of its obviousness argument. Yet neither the '609 patent nor the '651 patent directs a skilled person to the invention in the '080 Patent As Dr. Klibanov has testified, these patents, in fact, teach a skilled person that it is not worthwhile to resolve a quinolone racemate into its individual enantiomers in search of a better antimicrobial. (Klibanov Affidavit at para. 117, AR, v. 12, Tab 17, p. 3439.)
