Apotex claims that Dr. John Gerster's 1982 poster publicly disclosed the fact that the (-)-enantiomer of flumequine is the more antimicrobially active of the two enantiomers, and, thus, more active than its racemate. Futhermore, the poster presentation at the North American Medicinal Chemistry Symposium between June 20 and 24, 1982, disclosed both a method for separating the enantiomers of racemic flumequine, which involved the use of an optically-active tosyl-proline intermediate (which is identified by the patentee as Process C of the '080 patent), and that the differential antimicrobial activity of the (-)-enantiomer was about 2 times greater than that of racemic flumequine and between 10 and 100 times greater than the (+)-enantiomer.
