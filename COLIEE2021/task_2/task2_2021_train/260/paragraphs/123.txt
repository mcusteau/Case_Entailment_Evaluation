Levofloxacin is a fundamentally different compound from ofloxacin with superior properties. Levofloxacin is twice as potent, less toxic and ten times more water soluble than ofloxacin. Furthermore, as will be discussed below, levofloxacin could not be made by following prior art references - a new process to make levofloxacin had to be developed.
