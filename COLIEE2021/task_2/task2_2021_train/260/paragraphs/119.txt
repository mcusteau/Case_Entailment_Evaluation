Nowhere did Dr. Gerster testify that, in fact, people stopped by to discuss his poster presentation, or that he distributed copies of the poster to any attendee, or indeed anyone. Dr. Gerster testified on cross-examination that the 1982 poster does not appear anywhere in the book of materials that was distributed to all conference attendees. He does not recall ever being asked by anyone outside his company for a copy of the 1982 poster. While he initially testified that later published papers referred to the 1982 poster, on cross-examination he admitted that all such papers referenced the abstract in the conference proceedings, not the Poster.
