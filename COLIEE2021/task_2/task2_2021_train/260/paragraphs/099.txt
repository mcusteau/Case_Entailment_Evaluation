The Applicants submit that the '840 patent discloses and claims racemic ofloxacin. It does not disclose the S(-) enantiomer (levofloxacin), its unexpectedly superior properties, or a process to produce levofloxacin. The production processes taught by the '840 patent necessarily result in only the racemate (ofloxacin). A skilled person, following the teachings of the '840 patent, would be able to produce the racemate, but not an enantiomer. (Klibanov Affidavit, paras. 69-74, AR, v. 12, Tab 17, pp. 3418-3421.)
