Chemists distinguish between the two enantiomers of a given compound by assigning labels to each one. One convention involves assigning the prefixes "R" or "S" to each enantiomer. A chemist can tell by looking at a chemical diagram whether a particular enantiomer is the R enantiomer or the S enantiomer. A different convention uses the prefixes (+) or (-) to distinguish between enantiomers. These prefixes are assigned depending on whether the enantiomer rotates plane-polarized light to the right (+) or to the left (-). One enantiomer will always be (+) while the other enantiomer will always be (-).
