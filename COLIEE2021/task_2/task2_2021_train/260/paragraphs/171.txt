[171]
The '080 patent's claim 4 is a compound claim, and encompasses all its properties, including those discovered after the filing of the patent. The case at bar is analogous to the amlodipine
(Pfizer)
case and the
Bayer Cipro
cases, wherein the besylate salt of amlodipine (claim 11), and ciprofloxacin (Claim 14, as produced by a particular process), were at issue.
