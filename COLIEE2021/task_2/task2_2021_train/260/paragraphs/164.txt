Dr. Myerson further explained that this information still would not allow a skilled person to know the quantitative aspect of the relative solubility of ofloxacin and levofloxacin. Therefore, once a skilled person knew that levofloxacin was more soluble than ofloxacin, the skilled person would not know, and could not reasonably expect, that levofloxacin would be ten times more soluble than ofloxacin. (Myerson Affidavit at para. 33, AR, v. 22, Tab 30, p. 6592.)
