Apotex notes that, by the end of September of 1985, there had been a publication of an abstract and paper distributed at the posterboard presentation by Dr. Gerster at the 25th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy on the Stereochemical Aspects of the Antibacterial Activity of S-25930. The process disclosed by Dr. Gerster in this publication involved the use of an optically-active tosyl-proline intermediate, to resolve the enantiomers of ofloxacin. It further disclosed that the (S)(-)-enantiomer of a flumequine derivative, another tricyclic fluoroquinolone which is structurally similar to oflocaxin, was approximately twice as active as an antibacterial as the racemate (NOA, pp. 3511-3513 of AR.)
