Applying the factors to be considered, as of the date of the invention which can be considered as December 1985, Justice Hughes held that the invention covered by claim 4 of the '080 Patent is not obvious. After considering all of the evidence, after a month-long trial, he determined:
(a) The climate in the quinolone field at 1985 was to develop new drugs by substituting molecules onto core compounds. Chirality was only on the cusp of coming into serious contention and, at the time, little attention was given to enantiomers.
(b) Only Daiichi was motivated to obtain the enantiomers of ofloxacin in its search for a better antibiotic (this, in itself, being motivated by a desire to secure broader patent protection for its ofloxacin invention). The evidence established that competitors and those in the scientific and academic communities showed no interest in this pursuit.
(c) The properties of the individual enantiomers would not be predictable, particularly in 1985. One would have to produce the individual enantiomer and test it to determine whether it had one or more enhanced properties, and whether these outweighed the detrimental properties.
(d) There was no obvious way to obtain the enantiomers of ofloxacin. Knowledge regarding the means for separating the enantiomers from the racemate was still in its infancy in 1985. The techniques were not yet considered mainstream or common.
(e) The efforts Daiichi undertook to produce the enantiomers of ofloxacin were challenging.
