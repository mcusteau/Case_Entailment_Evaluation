Justice Mosley dismissed this application. While he found that the previous patents did not provide all of the information a person of ordinary skill in the art would have required to come to the patent in question and that the patent was not ambiguous nor was the specification insufficient, he concluded that "beneficial properties discovered and set out in the '080 patent were not unknown." Furthermore, he concluded that the "knowledge of the existence of and the possibility of separating the two enantiomers of ofloxacin was common to the ordinary chemist, and the determination of which enantiomer possessed a greater amount of the same benefits of the previously known racemic antibiotic was not surprising or inventive."
