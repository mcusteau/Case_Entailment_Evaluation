Claim construction precedes an assessment of infringement or validity. Claim construction is to be conducted purposively, in light of the patent as a whole, and not with excessive literalism. A patent is to be read through the eyes of a person of ordinary skill in the art, in an attempt to discern what the inventors of the patent intended. It must be read with a mind willing to understand, trying to achieve success and not looking for difficulties or seeking failure. (
