The achiral (non-chiral) exo-methylene (or "3-Methylene") ofloxacin derivative synthesized by Daiichi showed comparable activity to ofloxacin. A skilled person would understand from these references that if a methyl group was present it would be difficult to predict what its optimal orientation would be, but that its orientation would not be critical.
