There was no expectation that the enantiomer having higher activity would also have lower toxicity
: Dr. Rodricks, an expert in toxicology and safety evaluations, provided evidence that there was no expectation that one enantiomer of a racemic drug would be less toxic than the racemate. Indeed, no Apotex witness suggested that such an expectation existed. (Rodricks Affidavit at paras. 3-5, 57-58, AR, v. 24, Tab 34, pp. 7109-7110, 7128.)
