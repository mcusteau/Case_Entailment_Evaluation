Although racemic mixtures can be used for a variety of purposes including pharmaceuticals, it is often desirable to obtain a very pure sample of only one of the enantiomers. One means of obtaining a sample containing only one enantiomer is to start with a racemic mixture and separate it into its two constituent enantiomers. Generally, enantiomers cannot be separated mechanically and thus chemists must devise or apply chemical techniques to perform the separation. Different techniques may be used to perform the same separation; however, the purity of the products may differ, as may the cost or time involved in the separation.
