Dr. Kellogg admitted that if the Court construes claims 2 and 4 to cover levofloxacin hemihydrate, then Apotex will infringe those claims. This is the only basis for Apotex' allegation of non-infringement; therefore, if the Applicants' proposed construction of claim 4 is accepted by the Court, Apotex' allegation of non-infringement cannot be justified. (Kellogg cross at qq. 204, 210, AR, v. 47, Tab 70, p. 15203.)
