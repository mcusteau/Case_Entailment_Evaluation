Activity and Toxicity combined:
There was no expectation that the enantiomer having higher activity would also have lower toxicity. Dr. Rodricks' evidence is that the relative toxicity of racemates to their enantiomers cannot be predicted. No Apotex witness contradicted Dr. Rodricks' evidence in this regard.
