On July 18, 2005, the Respondent, Apotex, served on Janssen, a purported Notice of Allegation (NOA) concerning the '080 patent. The Respondent alleges that the '080 patent is invalid as it does not meet the test for a selection patent. They argue that levofloxacin does not possess unexpected, special advantages over ofloxacin. Further, the selection of levofloxacin from the ofloxacin mixture did not require any inventive ingenuity. The Applicants submit that the issues in this application are substantially similar to the issues and evidence on obviousness and anticipation as previously submitted to this Court in earlier litigations (Court File Nos. T-214-03; T-2175-04 and A-500-06).
