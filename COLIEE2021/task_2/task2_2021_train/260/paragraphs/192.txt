[192]
The requirements of a patentee during prosecution are d' errant under the current
Patent
Act
: Apotex' witness, Mr. Oyen, conflates the obligations required of a patentee or agent during patent prosecution under the old and current
Patent
Act
s
. The two
Acts
contain different rules in this respect, as Mr. Oyen admitted on cross-examination. While the current
Act
obligates an applicant to reply in good faith to every requisition made by an examiner, the old
Act
merely required an applicant to make a bona fide attempt to advance a patent application to allowance as a whole. These requirements are clearly different and should be interpreted as such. Under the old
Act
, provided that the applicant made a genuine attempt to advance the application as a whole to allowance - not necessarily in response to any specific requirement - the application is deemed to be prosecuted, and there is no abandonment.
