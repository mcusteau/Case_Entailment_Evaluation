The applicant also argues that the tribunal made a reviewable error when it failed to consider the documentary evidence submitted by the applicant in connection with the human rights situation in Pakistan. These documents are in fact objective documentary evidence. Usually, objective documentary evidence is not, on its own, sufficient to grant an applicant's refugee claim: Rahaman v.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 569 (F.C.T.D.) (QL).
