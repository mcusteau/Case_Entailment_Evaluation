On another issue, during a judicial review, courts must limit the scope of their review in such a way that only evidence that was submitted by the parties to the administrative decision maker will be taken into account. (Naredo and Arduengo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 132 F.T.R. 281 (F.C.T.D.) (QL); Owusu v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1505 Doc. A-1483-92 (F.C.T.D.) (QL)) To review a decision on the basis of new evidence would be to transform the review into an appeal. Consequently, all new evidence submitted by the applicant in her affidavit will not be considered by this Court.
