On another matter, this Court dismisses the applicant's allegation that her removal from Canada violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This Court is of the opinion that, following the decision of Kofitse v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 1168 (F.C.T.D.) (QL), the applicant's Charter arguments are without merit. These arguments are premature since the decision before us is not the final stage in the applicant's deportation, but is limited to the conclusion that the applicant is not a convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
