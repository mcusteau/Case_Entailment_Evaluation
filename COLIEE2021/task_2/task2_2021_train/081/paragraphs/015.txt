  I agree with the submissions made by the respondent that this is not a judicial review of the interviewing officer's decision to report the applicant pursuant to subsection 44(1) of the  
 Act 
 . It was at that step that the non-disclosure lies. Procedural fairness requires that material information be disclosed prior to the admissibility hearing; there is no requirement to disclose the report prior to the subsection 44(2) determination:  
 Hernandez 
 , above at para 24. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the husband's letters were not disclosed prior to the admissibility hearing. The letter from the officer to the former husband was never disclosed but I fail to see how that request for further information could be material or relevant to the issues before the tribunal.
