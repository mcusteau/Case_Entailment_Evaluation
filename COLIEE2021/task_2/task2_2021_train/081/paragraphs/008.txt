  No explanation is offered as to why it took Immigration Canada nearly two years to act on this allegation of fraud; however, on March 14, 2007, it sent the applicant a Call In Notice stating that the object was "Your Status in Canada - Misrepresentation." The interview was held on April 2, 2007 where, allegedly on the uncle's advice, the applicant told the immigration officer that Mr. Qureshi abused her and slapped her on the face when she did want him to watch pornographic movies. At the IAD hearing, the applicant admitted that this was a complete fabrication - a lie. It appears from the officer's report that the applicant was made aware of the details of the claims made by her former husband, including her pending marriage to Sohail Qureshi. She told the officer that although her uncle wanted her to marry Sohail, she refused and that as a result she and her uncle had had a falling out.
