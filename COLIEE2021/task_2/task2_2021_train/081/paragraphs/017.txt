  I am unable to accept the submission of the applicant that a letter written by a third party bringing information to the attention of the immigration authorities is any different than the recommendation at issue in  
 Chand 
 . The applicant was verbally informed of her former husband's allegations and responded to them. All that was not disclosed before the admissibility hearing was her letter asking for disclosure of the former husband's letter, (as in  
 Chand 
 , she was aware of the content of that letter) and the letter from the officer seeking more information which has no apparent relevance to the hearing. There was no denial of natural justice.
