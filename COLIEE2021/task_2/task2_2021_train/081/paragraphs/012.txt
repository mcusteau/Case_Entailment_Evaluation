  The applicant raised four issues but conceded one at the oral hearing, accordingly, the issues before the Court are as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. Did the IAD fail to observe a principle of procedural fairness? 
 
 
 
 2. Did the IAD apply too high a threshold in assessing the H&C grounds? 
 
 
 
 3. Did the IAD unreasonably consider the child's best interests?
