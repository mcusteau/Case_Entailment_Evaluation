Compuoffice has also requested, in the alternative, that the application for expungement be joined with the action for infringement. However, the same standard that applies to a motion for a stay of proceedings applies to a motion for joinder:
Mon-Oil
, supra. As Compuoffice has failed to demonstrate that it would suffer any injustice or prejudice, should the application be allowed to proceed, joinder with the action is not appropriate. In my opinion,
Gund
, supra, is distinguishable because it involved the joinder of two actions, one for infringement of industrial design registration, and the other for copyright infringement and statutory passing-off, not joinder of an action for infringement and an application for expungement.
