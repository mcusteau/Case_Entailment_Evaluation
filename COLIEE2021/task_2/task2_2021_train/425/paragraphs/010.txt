Compulife argues that a stay should not be granted since the applicant has not established that the continuation of the s. 57 proceeding would prejudice or cause injustice to the defendant; or that a stay would not prejudice the plaintiff. It is submitted that the court should exercise its discretion to stay sparingly, and only where there is a risk of imminent adjudication in two different forums. Therefore, Compulife submits that Compuoffice has failed to demonstrate that the expungement proceedings are prejudicial or would cause them an injustice. Compulife also submits that this same test applies to the motion for joinder:
Mon-Oil Ltd. v. Canada
(1989), 27 F.T.R. 50 (T.D.), at 51.
