  In applying the fairness principle, it is relevant in this case to look at the impact of the Applicant's position vis-Ã -vis others. All those persons who filed after September 19, 2011 but before the Applicant would have just as legitimate complaint as the Applicant. Since they were prior in filing time, their applications would have priority over the Applicant.
