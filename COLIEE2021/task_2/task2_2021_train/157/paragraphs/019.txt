  By way of comment, the Court is concerned that it is not absolutely clear that the date on which an application is considered received for purposes of the cap is the date the application is considered "complete" not merely "received". In other words, are incomplete applications given a priority date as "received" or is it only completed applications which achieve that time status? While this case does not turn on nor is it impacted by this possible confusion, there must be clarity brought to this situation.
