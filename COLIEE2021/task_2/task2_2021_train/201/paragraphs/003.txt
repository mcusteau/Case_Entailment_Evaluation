  The applicant had no contact with Viasna prior to 2007. At that time, she happened to meet her mother on a Montr√©al street. As a result of that fortuitous meeting, she began speaking with her son by telephone. Viasna was still a minor. The applicant wanted to have him come to Canada: she made an application to sponsor and undertaking in the family class; simultaneously, Viasna completed an application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations. That was in December 2007. On August 18, 2009, a little less than two years later, the officer communicated his refusal. The officer found, on the one hand, that because the applicant did not mention Viasna in her initial application when she arrived in Canada, Viasna was not a member of the family class and, on the other hand, there were no humanitarian and compassionate grounds to grant an exemption or special treatment.
