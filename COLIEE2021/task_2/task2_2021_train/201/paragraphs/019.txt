  Counsel for the applicant submits that, through a combination of uncontrollable circumstances, this is a case where the applicant who is before the Court to obtain justice must be able to contest the legality of the impugned decision especially considering its practical effect on the applicant and her son Viasna, the only one who has not yet been admitted to Canada, the applicant's two other children having already been sponsored. This is a case where the reunification of the family, Viasna's mother and his grandmother being in Canada, trumps the officer's unfounded personal criticism of the applicant in the impugned decision.
