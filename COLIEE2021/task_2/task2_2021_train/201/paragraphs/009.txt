  The respondent points out to the Court that, in a separate order also issued on October 4, 2010, Justice Pinard did not grant the motion to amend to add Viasna as a co-applicant. The Court should therefore summarily dismiss this application for judicial review without examining the merits of the arguments to set aside raised by the applicant in her memorandum because she is not "directly affected by the matter in respect of which relief is sought", as required by subsection 18.1(1) of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7 ( 
 Carson v . Canada 
  ( 
 Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 ), [1995] F.C.J. No. 656, (1995), 95 F.T.R. 137 ( 
 Carson 
 );  
 Wu v. Canada 
  ( 
 Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 ), [2000] F.C.J. No. 302, 4 Imm. L.R. (3d) 145) ( 
 Wu 
 ). Of course, the applicant strenuously contests the respondent's submissions.
