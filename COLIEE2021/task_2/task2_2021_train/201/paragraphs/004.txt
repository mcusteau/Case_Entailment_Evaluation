  That being said, on November 16, 2009, the applicant was advised by letter that she had the right to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board. However, the official missive indicated at the same time that if the IAD determined that Viasna was not a member of the family class, it would no longer have jurisdiction and would not be able to consider humanitarian and compassionate grounds; the appeal would therefore be dismissed. In spite of everything, the applicant filed her appeal but withdrew it on December 7, 2009, on the advice of her new counsel. In doing so, the applicant filed this application for judicial review on December 8, 2009, but it was out of time. With her application for leave and judicial review, the applicant filed an application for an extension of time. In a detailed affidavit, the applicant explained that she filed her appeal to the IAD as a result of receiving bad advice from her counsel at the time. Even so, the applicant's new counsel candidly admitted today that her assistant also did not include Viasna's name as a co-applicant, which would have avoided the procedural confusion created by her office's error.
