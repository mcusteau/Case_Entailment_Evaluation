  It must be noted that, procedurally and factually, we are faced today with a very unique, if not exceptional case that cannot serve in the future as a master key allowing a sponsor to circumvent the clear provisions of subsection 63(1) of the IRPA. The purpose of subsection 72(2)( 
 a 
 ) of the IRPA is to avoid multiple inconsistent proceedings. A party must not unduly appeal to the precious resources of the Court where another remedy is available and has not been exercised. On the other hand, the Court's rules of procedure must be interpreted so as to secure the just, most expeditious and least expensive determination of every proceeding on its merits. In this case, none of these goals were achieved.
