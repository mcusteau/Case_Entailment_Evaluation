In his affidavit and testimony, the male applicant stated that he did not hold a strategic position in the Peruvian army in the early years of his military service. When he became a pilot, he had no decision-making powers and flew reconnaissance, not combat, aircraft. As chief of the intelligence section, he had to prevent drug traffickers from infiltrating the battalion and protect the base from terrorist attacks. He argues that he never had a post in the insurgent areas where, according to the documentary evidence, the Peruvian army has committed acts of repression. He maintains that he was not aware of the army's plans concerning the intervention at the Japanese embassy during the hostage-taking incident.
