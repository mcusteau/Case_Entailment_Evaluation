In my view, the issues in this judicial review application are the following:
1. Did the Board err in excluding the male applicant from application of the Convention?
2. Did the Board err in deciding that there was no nexus between the applicants' fear and the grounds in the definition of Convention refugee under section 96 of the
Act
, that is, political opinion and membership in a particular social group, namely, the family?
3. Did the Board err in deciding that the applicants were not persons in need of protection under subsection 97(1) of the
Act
?
