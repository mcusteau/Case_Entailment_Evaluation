The Board did not believe the male applicant's testimony, stating it was evasive in the extreme, vague and unclear, and included answers that could not be taken seriously. The Board found that the following elements of the male applicant's story were not credible:
- That he was unaware that the armed forces used torture and committed abuses against the civilian population;
- That he was unaware of the hostage-taking at the Japanese embassy, where the army ended the siege in a bloodbath;
- That he was unaware of abuses committed against civilians in villages where Shining Path members were operating, whereas the army was fighting them, and he had counter-espionage and intelligence duties;
- That he was unaware that there was a prison at the Callao base where he lived for six years, while his wife was able to provide explanations about this.
