The provisions of the
Act
dealing with refugee protection are clearly not of a criminal or tax-related nature. They do, however, put individuals and the state in adversarial positions to some extent. In fact, individuals claiming refugee protection in Canada stand alone against the state, which decides whether protection is to be granted or not. The same provisions of the
Act
also include a measure of polycentricity, since they are intended to reconcile issues relating to contradictory political objectives and the interests of different groups, as clearly indicated by subsection 3(2) of the
Act
, which sets out legislative objectives concerning refugees. These include saving lives and offering protection to the displaced and persecuted (paragraph 3(2)(a)), fulfilling Canada's international legal obligations (paragraph 3(2)(b)) and granting, as a fundamental expression of Canada's humanitarian ideals, fair consideration to those who come to Canada claiming persecution (subsection 3(2)(c)). Therefore, I feel that the Court must show some, but not complete, deference.
