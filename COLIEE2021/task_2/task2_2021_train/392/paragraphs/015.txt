According to the statement of claim, the plaintiffs are, broadly speaking, in the business of research, development, manufacture, promotion, and sale of pharmaceutical preparations. In this context, the Canadian licensee has promoted
Pulmicort
pharmaceutical preparations for the treatment of pulmonary disease since 1988 and as of about a year ago had a 34% share of the Canadian market for inhaled steroids for pulmonary disease. These products are prescribed by physicians and administered both by health care professionals and by patients themselves. The plaintiffs go on to say that
Pulmicort
is a highly-regarded and reputable brand name, with valuable goodwill among those involved in health care and pharmaceuticals and, indeed, among patients themselves.
