This motion was initially to have been dealt with on a regular motions' day. In preparation for the expected oral presentations by counsel, I read the statement of claim, the defendant's motion and affidavit in support, and the relevant portions of the
Trade-marks Act
. It seemed to me, on my initial reading of the material, that the defendant, on the basis of the statement of claim, had reasonable particulars in order to file a defence. My initial reaction was bolstered by the fact that the defendant did not file affidavit evidence setting out the need for further particulars in order to file a defence. Further particulars, or broader particulars, might be necessary for trial and those, if the defendant so desired, might be forthcoming on examination for discovery, but that is another issue.
