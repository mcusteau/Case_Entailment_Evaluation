  In  
 A.B. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  [see footnote 3], Justice Zinn of this Court found a PRRA Officer to have erred in discounting reports of violence against homosexuals in Guyana. He concluded at paragraph 24 of his Reasons that such a failure to consider relevant evidence would, standing alone, be sufficient to grant the judicial review that was before him. I am prepared to reach the same conclusion here. I am prepared to take judicial notice of the fact that the region of Canada in which the Applicant lives has a significant Canadian-Jamaican population. The Applicant is active in that community. It is entirely possible that the Applicant's openly gay lifestyle in Canada is already known to persons in Jamaica who might pose a risk to the Applicant. His same-sex marriage only enhances the risk that his openly-gay lifestyle might become known in Jamaica, if it is not already known. The failure to acknowledge this new evidence and to take it into account in determining whether the Applicant now faces a personalized risk of persecution or a risk to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Jamaica constitutes a reviewable error against the standard of review of correctness and, even more certainly, against the standard of review of reasonableness.
