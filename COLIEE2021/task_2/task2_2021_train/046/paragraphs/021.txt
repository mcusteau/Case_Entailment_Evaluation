  In light of my foregoing conclusion, I will deal only briefly with these two allegations on behalf of the Applicant of reviewable error. Apart from failing to give any consideration to the impact of the Applicant's marriage in the Officer's risk analysis, with particular emphasis on the requirement that such analysis be personalized to the particular circumstances of the Applicant and that it be forward-looking, I find no reviewable error against a standard of review of reasonableness. By contrast, the Officer's explanation for according minimal weight to the affidavit of Gareth Henry, I find to be less than convincing, once again, particularly in the light of the Applicant's uncontested openly gay lifestyle in the community in which he lives in Canada.
