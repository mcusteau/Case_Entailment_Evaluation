  In general, an application for judicial review is based on the documentation before the original decision-maker. However, if it is not possible to decide the question, there are exceptions, for instance where the tribunal’s authority is in issue. It will not suffice for the Minister to argue that the documents could have been obtained by an access to information application. As mentioned by Phelen J. in Cooke v. Canada (Correctional Service), 2005 FC 712, [2005] F.C.J. No. 886 (QL), at paragraphs 22 and 23 : 
 
 
 
 ¶ 22 I reject any suggestion made by the Respondent that an applicant must use such indirect means as the Access to Information Act to secure materials in a tribunal's possession where the tribunal had failed to meet its obligations under Rule 318(1). 
 
 
 
 ¶ 23 Since the material which is "relevant to an application" is material which may affect the decision that this Court may make; and, in this instance the Applicant clearly attacked the adequacy of the investigation, the material requested by the Applicant under Rule 317 should have been provided to him. (CBC v. Paul, [2001] F.C.J. No. 542, 2001 FCA 93).
