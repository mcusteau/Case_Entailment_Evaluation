The respondent's employment was terminated on July 10, 1996. The acting Regional Director of Transport Canada's Air Traffic Services for Ontario wrote advising him he was rejected while on probation. The first paragraph of that letter reads:

."
"You are hereby rejected on probation ... ." (emphasis mine)
