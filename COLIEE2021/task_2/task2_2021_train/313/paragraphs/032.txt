In the face of the respondent's grievance alleging bad faith in respect of his rejection on probation, the adjudicator, here, required evidence from the employer to determine whether its termination was under the
PSEA
and therefore beyond its jurisdiction, or if it was for reasons foreign to the
PSEA
upon which it could ground jurisdiction under section 92 of the
PSSRA
. The adjudicator's authority to deal with the grievance depends entirely on this decision of fact. An error in determining the facts would warrant intervention by this Court, as Justice MacKay concluded in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Horn
, [1994] 1 F.C. 453; 68 F.T.R. 244 (T.D.) at pages 467-468.
"In my opinion, in light of the decision of Cory, J., for the majority in the '93 PSAC case the Adjudicator here, dealing with the grievance of Ms. Horn under subsection 92(1) of the
PSSRA
, in determining whether the matter was a grievance in relation to 'disciplinary action resulting in discharge', was dealing with a question of jurisdiction, where simple error warrants intervention of the Court on judicial review. ... If that is so, mere error in applying the
Act
, i.e. subsection 92(1)
PSSRA
, is sufficient to find that the Adjudicator has exceeded the statutory jurisdiction conferred; or as it is sometimes said he must be 'correct' in his interpretation.
"The Adjudicator, in determining the question of whether the respondent's grievance was one within subsection 92(1) as concerning 'disciplinary action resulting in discharge', was required to assess the action taken by the employer purporting to act under section 27 of the
PSEA
. His decision, that the action was taken for disciplinary reasons and thus constituted a discharge within his jurisdiction under paragraph 92(1)(b) of the
PSSRA
, was a decision of fact,
but one sometimes described as jurisdictional fact since his authority to deal with the merits of the grievance was dependent upon his determination of that fact
." (emphasis mine)
