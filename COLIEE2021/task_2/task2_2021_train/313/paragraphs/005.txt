On August 9, 1996, the respondent grieved Transport Canada's July 10, 1996 decision. He details his grievance as follows:
"
I have been improperly dismissed and terminated. This was done in bad faith and contrary to the employer's policies and practices
. I wish to be reinstated in a position as an ATC trainee or to be offered alternate employment within ATS or be designated as being transferred to NAV Canada. I would prefer to be reinstated at a location other than the one where my employment was terminated. I wish to be reimbursed for any losses of pay, benefits and entitlements or otherwise to be made whole." (emphasis mine)
