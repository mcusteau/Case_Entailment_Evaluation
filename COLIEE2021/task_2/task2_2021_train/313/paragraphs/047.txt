[47]
Although the decision in
Penner
, supra, predates the adoption of subsection 92(3), I am of the view that its principles still apply. As I see it, the purpose of subsection 92(3) of the
PSSRA
which was added by Parliament in 1993 was to make clear what
Jacmain
and
Penner
said about the flexibility to be accorded the employer in the rejection of a probationary employee under the
PSEA
and this without recourse to adjudication under the
PSSRA
. At the same time, its addition as was held by Justice NoÃ«l in
Rinaldi
, supra, does not remove the ability from the adjudicator solely because such a termination is relied upon by the employer. The reason he said so was because subsection 93(2) only operates when there was in fact a termination under the
PSEA
.
