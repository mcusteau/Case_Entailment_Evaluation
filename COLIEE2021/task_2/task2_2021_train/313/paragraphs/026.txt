The Adjudicator, in
Rinaldi
, supra, had decided to continue the hearing saying at paragraph 9:
"If you establish that the termination of the employment was not a genuine layoff but rather a decision made in bad faith, a ruse, a disciplinary dismissal in disguise, then I would be willing to say that subsection 92(3) of the
Public Service Staff Relations Act
does not prevent me from having jurisdiction."
