The Attorney General relies on what Justice NoÃ«l said at note 15 of his reasons in these terms:
"I want to emphasize that insofar as the action or termination of employment occurred under section 29, a simple demonstration of bad faith or malicious intent on the employer's part (such as proof of an obvious desire to get rid of the employee at the first opportunity) would not confer jurisdiction on the Adjudicator since, whether or not there was bad faith, the grievance would still be a grievance with respect to a termination of employment under the
Public Service Employment Act
, which subsection 92(3) of the
Public Service Staff Relations Act
excludes from the Adjudicator's jurisdiction.
When the employer argues that the employment was terminated under the
Public Service Employment Act
, the only way to show that it was not would be to prove that the conditions required to apply it were in fact not present at the relevant time and that the employment cannot therefore have been terminated under that
Act
." (emphasis mine)
