A review of the case law reveals an attack on the tribunal's jurisdiction or the absence of an appropriate remedy at the end of the proceedings would constitute special or exceptional circumstances. In
Pfeiffer v. Canada (Superintendent of Bankruptcy)
, [1996] 3 F.C. 584; 116 F.T.R. 173 (T.D.), Justice Tremblay-Lamer concluded at page 596:
"...
since the issue involves an attack on the very existence of the tribunal
, there is a special reason permitting judicial review at this stage of the proceedings. As the Court held in
Mahabir v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration
, [1992] 1 F.C. 133 (C.A.), at p. 140,
it is a final decision that disposes of a substantive question before the tribunal
."
