Evans, J., as he then was, in
Air Canada v. Lorenz et al.
, [2000] 1 F.C. 494; 175 F.T.R. 211 (T.D.), concluded at page 502:
"Courts are similarly reluctant to intervene to review an interim or interlocutory decision prior to the conclusion of the proceeding before the administrative tribunal."
He further added at paragraph 37 of the same decision:
"Thus, it has been said that a court should only intervene before the tribunal has rendered its final decision in 'exceptional circumstances' (
University of Toronto v. Canadian Union of Education Workers, Local 2
(1988), 28 O.A.C. 295 (Ont. Div. Ct.), at page 306), in 'exceptional or extraordinary circumstances' (
Ontario College of Art v. Ontario (Human Rights Commission)
, supra, at page 799), or where the attack is on the 'very existence of the tribunal' (
Pfeiffer v. Canada (Superintendent of Bankruptcy) (T.D.)
, [1996] 3 F.C. 584 (T.D.) page 596)."
