Moreover, Mackay, J., in
Horn
, supra, held at page 470:
"That special role, and the expertise of those charged with responsibility under the
PSSRA
in the resolution of differences arising in labour relations in the public sector is now well settled... .
"Determination of what constitutes 'disciplinary action' in a given case was, in my view, intended by Parliament to be a matter for determination by those appointed as adjudicators by the Public Service Staff Relations Board pursuant to section 93 of the
PSSRA
. The question for the Adjudicator is whether the employer's action is 'disciplinary action resulting in discharge' under subsection 92(1). It is the sort of question that lies within the core of the Board's concerns with labour management relations in the Public Service and within the recognized expertise and experience of those persons appointed by the Board as adjudicators... .
"These general considerations relating to appropriate deference for decisions of the Adjudicator lead me to consider that in this case the ultimate burden is on the applicant to persuade the Court that the Adjudicator was wrong in his finding that the respondent was discharged for disciplinary reasons."
