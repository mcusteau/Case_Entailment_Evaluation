In the circumstances, as the adjudicator put it, and I quote again, to do so would:
"... open the door to decisions which may be entirely arbitrary, based on irrelevant considerations, and possibly without a scintilla of legitimacy. It should be kept in mind that it is the employer who is uniquely in a position to know why it took the decision that it did; in the absence of providing at least minimal evidence and information, it puts the grievor in the invidious position of having to speculate as to the reasons behind the decision, and thereby assume an almost impossible burden in seeking to demonstrate bad faith. This is not mandated by the legislation in question, and flies in the face of simple fairness and common sense."
