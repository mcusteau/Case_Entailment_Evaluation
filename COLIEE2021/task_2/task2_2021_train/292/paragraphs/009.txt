Concerning the fact that the applicant had a passport from the new Yugoslavia; the Board is an expert Board and should be aware of the issue of passports of convenience. The Board made no reference to s. 93 of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
Handbook on procedures and criteria for determining refugee status
(re-edited Geneva, January 1992) at p. 22, para. 93. The paragraph reads as follows:
"93. Nationality may be proved by the possession of a national passport. Possession of such a passport creates a prima facie presumption that the holder is a national of the country of issue, unless the passport itself states otherwise. A person holding a passport showing him to be a national of the issuing country, but who claims that he does not possess that country's nationality, must substantiate his claim, for example, by showing that the passport is a so-called 'passport of convenience' (an apparently regular national passport that is sometimes issued by a national authority to non-nationals). However, a mere assertion by the holder that the passport was issued to him as a matter of convenience for travel purposes only is not sufficient to rebut the presumption of nationality. In certain cases, it might be possible to obtain information from the authority that issued the passport. If such information cannot be obtained, or cannot be obtained within reasonable time, the examiner will have to decide on the credibility of the applicant's assertion in weighing all other elements of his story."
