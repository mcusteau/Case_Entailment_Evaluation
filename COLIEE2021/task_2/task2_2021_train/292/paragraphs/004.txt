Unfortunately, in its reasons, the Board does not explicitly differentiate between the new Yugoslavia and the former Yugoslavia. The applicant states that she was under the impression that the Board was talking about the former Yugoslavia when it asked its questions and made its determinations, and not the new Yugoslavia, where she had stayed for only five weeks prior to her coming to Canada. The applicant was not the only one who was confused by what was being discussed by the Board. The RHO made the following response to a comment by the presiding member (at p. 8 of the transcript):
"PRESIDING MEMBER: ... Where's the one on Serbia? I'm looking at the one regarding Yugoslavia. She's a Serb with citizenship of Yugoslavia and it was issued out of Belgrade, correct? The passport?
"RHO: Well, I'll defer to you because I'm not really familiar with this part of this world."
