As its evidence on appeal, the appellant filed the affidavit of C.S. Ho which traces the origin of the trademark MITAC as a coined word and outlines the international sales figures for MITAC products. This affidavit also included copies of advertisements for MITAC products which have appeared in various international publications. The appellant also filed the affidavit of Jean Reavley, Vice-President of Stargate Consultants Limited, who conducted research on behalf of the appellant. The affidavit of Jean Reavley refers to searches and surveys conducted from the Yellow Pages Directories of the cities of Ottawa and Toronto as well as a telephone survey of stores in the Ottawa area. These surveys were intended to demonstrate that very few businesses distribute both photocopiers and computers.
