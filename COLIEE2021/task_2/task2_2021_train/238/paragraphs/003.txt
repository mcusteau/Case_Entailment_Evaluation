The respondent filed a statement of opposition seeking rejection of the appellant's application on the following grounds:
"1. The use of the trademark of the applicant and the opponent's trademark in the same area would be likely to lead to the inference that the wares of services associated with such trademarks are manufactured, sold or performed by the same person and therefore the marks are confusing within the meaning of s. 6(2) of the
Trade-marks Act
.
"2. The applicant's trademark is not registrable in that it is contrary to s. 12(1)(d) of the
Trade-marks Act
and the application should be refused under s. 37(2)(b) of the
Trade-marks Act
.
"3. The applicant is not the person entitled to registration of the trademark that is the subject matter of its application in that it is contrary to s. 16(1)(a) of the
Trade-marks Act
and the application should be refused under s. 37(2)(c) of the
Trade-marks Act
.
"4. The trademark of the applicant is not distinctive having regard to s. 37(2)(d) of the
Trade-marks Act
, since the applicant's trademark neither distinguishes nor is it adapted to distinguish the applicant's wares from those offered for sale and sold by opponent in association with its trademark."
