  In the present case, the applicants actually met all of the educational requirements for the positions prior to the closing date of the competitions. However, since the university required a period of approximately eight weeks to prepare a transcript, the applicants were unable to submit transcripts to prove their successful completion of the advanced accounting course. As a result, they were unable, for reasons beyond their control, to comply with the screening criterion in the competition posters that required them to submit copies of transcripts to support their educational qualifications. As indicated previously, the applicants met all of the screening criteria, save and except for the provision of the transcript in relation to one course of study.
