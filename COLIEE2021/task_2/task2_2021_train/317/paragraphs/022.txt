In the present matter, the claim of the Applicants was rejected because the RPD found that State protection was available. Their claim was rejected as they did not meet the necessary conditions in order to be considered refugees or persons in need of protection. The exception enacted at para.108(1)(e) was not applicable. Therefore, the RPD was under no obligation to perform any assessment of "compelling reasons".
