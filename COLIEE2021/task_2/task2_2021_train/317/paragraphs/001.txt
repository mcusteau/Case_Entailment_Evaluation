: This is an application for judicial review pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c. 27 ("IRPA") with respect to a decision of B. Wong of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying the claim for refugee protection of Luis Amado Contreras Martinez (Applicant), Claudia Moran Sanchez (Ms. Sanchez), Luis Francisco Contreras Moran and Marinieves Contreras Moran (Applicants). In its decision dated May 26, 2005, the RPD determined that the Applicants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection as per section 96 and 97 of the IRPA. The RPD found that the Applicants did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in Mexico as state protection is available in this country.
