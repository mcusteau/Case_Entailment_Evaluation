In my view, there are no inconsistencies between the two above passages. The issue to address in every instance where state protection is at stake is whether state protection might reasonably have been forthcoming if the refugee claimant had sought such protection. The evidence must then be weighted to decide if the presumption of state protection is rebutted on a case-by case basis. If, as mentioned in Zhuravlvev, the state is shown to be the agent of persecution, then the effectiveness of state protection is pointless. However, a conclusion that the state, as a whole, is the agent of persecution in a given case should not be reached in an expedite manner. Where the persecutors are purely local or rogue elements of the state apparatus, an assessment of the availability of state protection should be conducted, as highlighted by Justice Snider. The question remains whether it is objectively reasonable for the claimant to seek protection, taking all relevant circumstances into consideration.
