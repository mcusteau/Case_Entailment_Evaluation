What triggered the applicant's concern was the following statement contained in his Offender Security Level Referral Decision Sheet ("OSLRDS") of May 1997 (A.R. page 86) which reads:
"CMT recommends maintenance of Maximum Security ruling with the following attributes identified:
Institutional Adjustment Concerns - High
, noting
the assault
on another inmate this past year, ongoing preventative security concerns re escape potential and ongoing concerns about emotional stability;
Escape Risk High,
noting past
escape from Iran
(self reported) and
alleged attempted escapes
plus deportation status which, in his view, is unthinkable as he escaped from Iran;
Public Safety concerns - High
, noting the violence of the index offences, use of firearms, plus no easy determination that there has been meaningful intervention to reduce the risk level in this case. UMB recommends maintain maximum security." (emphasis mine)
