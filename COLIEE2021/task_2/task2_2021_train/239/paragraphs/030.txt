The applicant could not, in this judicial review proceeding, challenge decisions which relate back to 1995 and 1996 and, in particular, decisions involving involuntary transfer, the raising of his security level and administrative segregation which could have been challenged at the appropriate time where he would have been entitled, subject to some exceptions, to the information which CSC was relying on to make those decisions (see sections 28 to 45 of the
Act
). The applicant cannot, through a review from the Commissioner's decision in this matter, make a collateral attack on past decisions which he had an opportunity to challenge directly at the appropriate time subject to the time limits prescribed under section 18 of the
Federal Court Act
.
