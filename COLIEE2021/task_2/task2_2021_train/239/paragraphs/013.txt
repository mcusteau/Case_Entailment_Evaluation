Specifically, the applicant points to a December 1, 1995 report recommending the applicant's involuntary transfer from Warkworth Institution back to Kingston Penitentiary. This report is set out at page 74 of the applicant's application record where he is reported to have successfully escaped from prison in Iran and is reported to have attempted escape from the Ottawa-Carleton Regional Detention Centre ("OCRDC") after his 1992 conviction for robbery. This 1995 report refers to the 1992 incident at the OCRDC reporting he "was caught with hacksaw blades and was accused of trying to escape by cutting through the window bars". He complains about a third allegation, based on "reliable sources", he was planning to escape from Warkworth Institution.
