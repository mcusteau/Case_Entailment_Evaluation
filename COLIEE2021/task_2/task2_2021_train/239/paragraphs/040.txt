As I view it, section 24 of the
Act
is part of an offender's "rights package" established by Parliament in 1992 when the
Act
was passed to modernize previous legislation, i.e. the
Penitentiaries Act
and the
Parole Act
, a modernization which was compelled by decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and lower courts on prisoners' rights.
