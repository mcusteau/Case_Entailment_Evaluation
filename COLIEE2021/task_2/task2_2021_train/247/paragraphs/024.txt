The applicant states that he seeks an order prohibiting the A.G.C. "from surrendering the applicant for extradition to the United States of America while the applicant's claim to Convention refugee status remains pending. The Minister refused, on February 14, 1997, to refrain from surrendering the applicant". In effect, according to the applicant, the decision is the refusal to refrain from surrendering the applicant while the claim for refugee status is outstanding and not an actual surrender under s. 25(1) of the
Extradition Act
. Section 25(1) reads in part:
"Subject to this Part, the Minister of Justice, on the requisition of a foreign state, may, within a period of ninety days after the date of a fugitive's committal for surrender, under the hand and seal of the Minister, order the fugitive to be surrendered to the person or persons who are, in the Minister's opinion, duly authorized to receive the fugitive in the name and on behalf of the foreign state, and the fugitive shall be so surrendered accordingly."
