There is no doubt that the usual jurisdiction of this court to hear applications for judicial review or its powers under s. 17(1) of the
Federal Court Act
to grant relief against the Crown has been ousted by the clear and unambiguous terms of the
Extradition Act
(Section 17(1) reads, "
Except as otherwise provided in this Act or any other Act of Parliament
the Trial Division has concurrent original jurisdiction in all cases where relief is claimed against the Crown". (Emphasis added)).
