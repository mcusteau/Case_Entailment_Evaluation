Section 25.2(1) of the
Extradition Act
is even more explicit on the jurisdiction issue. It was added to the
Extradition Act
in S.C. 1992, c. 13, and came into force on December 1, 1992. It reads:
"Notwithstanding the
Federal Court Act
, the court of appeal of the province in which the committal of a fugitive was ordered has exclusive original jurisdiction to hear and determine applications for judicial review under this
Act
, in accordance with subss. (2) to (10), made in respect of the decision of the Minister of Justice under s. 25."
