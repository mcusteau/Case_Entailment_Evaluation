In the meantime, on October 17, 1996, some four years after his arrival in Canada, the applicant filed a claim for refugee status. On December 12, 1996, the applicant was found to be "eligible" to claim Convention refugee status. However, on that same date, an immigration adjudicator also issued a conditional deportation order against the applicant. Finally, on January 5, 1997, the applicant applied to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations pursuant to the
Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
. The applicant sought a declaration from the Committee that Canada would be in violation of its international obligations if it extradited the applicant to Florida to face a possible discriminatory death penalty sentence. In addition, the Committee issued an interim request to Canada to refrain from extraditing the applicant until the Committee had disposed of the application. The Minister has not yet responded to the Committee's request.
