The basis of the current application for interim relief is inextricably linked to his claim for refugee status. The applicant states that he faces the death penalty in the state of Florida if he is extradited to the U.S.A. and convicted of several outstanding charges. The applicant faces both state and federal charges dating from February, 1991. The state charge is for first degree murder. The federal charges are for conspiracy to possess a narcotic with intent to distribute, possession of a narcotic with intent to distribute and carrying and using a firearm. The applicant alleges that he is a refugee with a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of race because the death penalty is applied in a discriminatory fashion against Hispanics in the U.S.A.
