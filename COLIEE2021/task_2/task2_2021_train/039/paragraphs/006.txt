  The PRRA officer determined that Ms. Augusto would not be subject to a risk of persecution, danger, torture, risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if returned to Angola. The officer assigned little weight to the notification and to the letter from Ms. Augusto's friend. The officer was not satisfied that the authorities were still looking for her. Alternatively, the officer stated that, even if the notification were valid, there was no reason why Ms. Augusto would not be provided a pardon. The documentary evidence revealed that an amnesty law had been passed in Angola whereby all crimes against the state were pardoned. Documentation from the UNHCR indicated that there were no cases where a returnee was denied amnesty under this law.
