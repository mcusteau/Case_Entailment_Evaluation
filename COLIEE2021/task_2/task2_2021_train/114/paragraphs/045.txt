 [45] 
  In my view, the condition imposed upon the petitioner is sufficiently clear and precise to be understood and enforced. It is obviously not beyond the comprehension of any reasonable person. The restriction is reasonably and necessarily related to the interests of the community and, moreover, it stands as an additional safeguard for the parolee in his progress towards full rehabilitation. Prudence alone would dictate that he avoid the company of people who might lead him astray. If per chance the petitioner became the victim of any arbitrary or discriminatory interpretation or enforcement of the condition, he can still look to the courts for redress.
