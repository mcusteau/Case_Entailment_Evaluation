 [43] 
  In United States of America v. Albanese (1977), 554 F. 2d 543, the condition of probation required the appellant to "associate only with law-abiding persons". The United States of Appeals, Second Circuit, held (at page 544) as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Although conditions phrased in terms of 'law-abiding persons' would better be avoided, condition of probation that defendant associate only with law-abiding persons was not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad as applied to defendant who was found to have continually and consistently associated over period of years on more than casual basis with large number of convicted criminals."
