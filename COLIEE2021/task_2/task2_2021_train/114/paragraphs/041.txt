  With reference to the clarity of the condition imposed by the Board, the Superior Court has this to say (at page 10): 
 
 
 
 "... Examining the present situation within those guide lines I am satisfied, first of all, that 'l'avis de manquement' sets out sufficiently the breach reproached to MacAllister and reveals clearly the violation in question. Furthermore, in that context, I simply cannot accept that the condition imposed, as amended on November 25th, 1985, is so unclear as to beyond the comprehension of the ordinary man and I say that quite irrespective of the subsequent clarifications to the nature and the extent of the restriction that were furnished by the Parole Board to MacAllister's attorneys."
