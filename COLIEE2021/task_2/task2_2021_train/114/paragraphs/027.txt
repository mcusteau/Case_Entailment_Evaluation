  In the petitioner's view, the Board manifestly increased the threat of punishment to him by broadening the terms and conditions governing his parole, for breach of which he can be reincarcerated. He does not ground his complaint upon the procedural aspects of the principles of fundamental justice, but seeks the application of the substantive standards of the principles of fundamental justice as well as the procedural ones. He submits that the growing opinion within the judiciary and the legal community has been one that tends to include the concept that the phrase "principles of fundamental justice" found in s. 1 of the Charter embraces a substantive content as well as the recognized procedural aspect. He quotes Professor David P. Jones from his work "Principles of Administrative Law" as follows: 
 
 
 
 "... This phrase (the principles of fundamental justice) is borrowed from the earlier Canadian Bill of Rights and undoubtedly was intended to elevate the procedural aspects of natural justice to constitutional status in any matters dealing with life, liberty and security of the person.... First, the very words used in section 7 are not restricted to procedural matters, but are equally capable of referring to substantive circumstances in which it would be fundamentally 'unjust' to deprive someone of life, liberty or security of the person.... Secondly, ... the United States courts have interpreted these two amendments to require not only procedural fairness but also 'substantive due process' in  
 certain circumstances
