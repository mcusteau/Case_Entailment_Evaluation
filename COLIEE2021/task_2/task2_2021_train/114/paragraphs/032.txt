  In Blanchard v. Control Data Canada (1984), 55 N.R. 194 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada dealt with the problem of the extent of judicial review of the decisions of administrative boards. Lamer, J., found (at page 207) that the proper question to put in that case was whether the award made by the arbitrator was "so patently unreasonable that its construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation and demands intervention by the court upon review". That test was first imposed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Canadian Union of Public Employees v. New Brunswick Liquor Corporation, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 227; 26 N.R. 34; 25 N.B.R.(2d) 237; 51 A.P.R. 237; 97 D.L.R.(3d) 417; 79 C.L.L.C. 14,209. He further held (at page 209) that the courts "should only intervene if they find a genuine excess of jurisdiction by the arbitrator, not simply where they disagree with his findings". Quoting Dickson, J., in Jacmain v. Attorney General of Canada, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 15; 18 N.R. 361, he added (at page 211) that "the error must be manifest". The role of the court is one of review not trial de novo.
