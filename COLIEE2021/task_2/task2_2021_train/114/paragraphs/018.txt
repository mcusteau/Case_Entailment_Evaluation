  In Latham v. Solicitor General of Canada et al. (1984), 39 C.R.(3d) 78, an inmate who had his day parole revoked by the Board obtained relief from the court on the ground that the Board failed to notify him adequately of the reasons for the revocation of his day parole. The court said that "a law which purports to deny even this is not a reasonable limitation within the meaning of s. 1 of the Charter of the rights guaranteed in s. 7 thereof".
