  In my view, it has been clearly established that the right to pursue the gaining of a livelihood  
 in any province 
  means precisely that. It is not an absolute right to work, but a mobility right. That issue was resolved in Law Society of Upper Canada v. Skapinker (1984), 53 N.R. 169; 3 O.A.C. 321; 11 C.C.C.(3d) 481 (S.C.C.), wherein the Supreme Court of Canada held that, properly construed, s. 6(2)(b) does not establish a right to work separate and distinct from the mobility provision in which it is found. The two rights in s. 6(2)(a) and (b) both relate to movement to another province, either for the taking up of residence, or to work without establishing residence. Thus, s. 6(2)(b) does not clothe a permanent resident with an added constitutional right to work as a lawyer in the province of residence so as to override the provincial legislation.
