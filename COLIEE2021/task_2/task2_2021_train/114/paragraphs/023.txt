  In my view, the petitioner's first legal argument begs the question. It raises two fundamental points: firstly, does s. 10(1)(a) of the Parole Act violate any specific section of the Charter?; secondly, if it does, then the onus shifts and the respondent must show pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter that the paragraph imposes a reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society (see R. v. Oakes, at page 114). In other words, the other three legal arguments must be considered before I attempt to resolve the issues encompassed by s. 1 of the Charter.
