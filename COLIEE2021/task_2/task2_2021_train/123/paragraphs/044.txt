 [44] 
  In closing, I would note that there is nothing to the applicant's argument that there was a breach of natural justice because one of the Board members fell asleep. This is a completely intolerable argument. Nor is there any indication that the applicants' case was given short-shrift. 
 
 
 
 Application allowed.
