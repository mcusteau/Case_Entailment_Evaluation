  Another issue in this case was whether the Board applied the correct test as to the meaning of "persecution". Actually, the Board did not state any test it just said that there was nothing to indicate there was any State persecution. In  
 Rajudeen v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
  (1984), 55 N.R. 129 (F.C.A.), the court cited with approval the following definition of persecution at pages 133-134: 
 
 
 
 "To harass or afflict with repeated acts of cruelty or annoyance; to afflict persistently, to afflict or punish because of particular opinions or adherence to a particular creed or mode of warship ..." 
 
 
 
 "A particular course or period of systematic infliction of punishment directed against those holding a particular (religious belief); persistent injury or annoyance from any source."
