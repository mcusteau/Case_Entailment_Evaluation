  In June 1990 the applicant was attacked by a knife-wielding man who, the applicant claims, later turned out to be a police officer. She was able to escape without injury. In September 1990, two men attacked her son inside their apartment building. The son was able to escape without injury. As a result of these events the applicant became worried that the police were "setting up" another accident for herself or her son so she fled the country. In a letter from her mother-in-law the applicant was informed that the same man who had attacked her with a knife had been seen in her former neighbourhood.
