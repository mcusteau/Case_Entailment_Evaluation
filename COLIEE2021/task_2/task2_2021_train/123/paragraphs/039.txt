  There is absolutely no merit in this claim. Indeed, it would seem to be frivolous and vexatious. It is clear from the respondent's evidence that the Board member merely closed his eyes from time to time and was always attentive to the applicant's testimony. He was alert to asking for dates and in cross-examination. Nor is there any evidence that the applicant was given short-shrift.
