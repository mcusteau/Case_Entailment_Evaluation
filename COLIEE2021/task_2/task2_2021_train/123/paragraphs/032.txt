  The Police wanted to get the applicant's husband to return to Bulgaria and indicated their willingness to use the applicant and her son to achieve that purpose. Certainly, this shows that because of their membership in a particular social group (i.e., the fact that she and her son were the immediate family of the man sought by police) the applicant and her son were potential targets. It is clear that the police told the applicant that she and her son would be targeted so that the applicant's husband would have no choice but to return home.
