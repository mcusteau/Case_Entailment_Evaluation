  The Board accepted most of the applicant's evidence as credible. The Board also found that the applicant had a subjective fear of persecution. The Board then went on, however, to state that her fear must be assessed in light of the conditions in Bulgaria at the time of the hearing. That is, the Board inquired into whether the conditions in Bulgaria were such that the applicant could not establish an objectively based fear of persecution. With respect to this the Board stated the following at page 4 of its reasons: 
 
 
 
 "The evidence adduced including the  
 Standardized Country Files 
  was carefully reviewed by the panel. The evidence shows that since the latter part of 1989, Bulgaria has made meaningful inroads towards democracy. Reasonably free and fair elections have been held in June 1990, resulting in a coalition government formed by elected members of the former Communist Party which was renamed Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and members of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF). Significant improvements have also taken place in the area of religion, freedom of speech and assembly, mobility inside and outside the country and human rights ..." 
 
 
 
 and at page 6: 
 
 
 
 "Counsel for the claimant submitted that in spite of changes in government, in reality, nothing has changed in the claimant's country and that the control remains in the same hands. 
 
 
 
 "While the situation in Bulgaria may indeed require time to become stable, and some undesirable aspect of the old order may still linger and on occasion manifest themselves, we are not persuaded by counsel's argument. The evidence, as mentioned above shows real and substantial improvements."
