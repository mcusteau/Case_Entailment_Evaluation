Ms. Nielans finds the situation she is faced with to be a harsh one. She feels she has paid enough. But the regime under which she labours is equally applicable to all Canadian taxpayers. Her hardships are the result of decision that she has freely made. She created the problem by not filing tax returns and not paying tax. Since then, as Ms. Fitzsimmons, her Collections Officer, has pointed out, her "net yearly income between 1998 and 2001 averaged $71,585, providing ample funds to clear the entire debt. Instead, she paid off her vehicle and increased RSPs to $25,000."
