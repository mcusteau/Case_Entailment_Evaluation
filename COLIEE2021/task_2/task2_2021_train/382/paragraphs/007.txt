During the October 25, 2003 meeting, the parties discussed the Applicant's inability to pay in full the total amount of $19,000. The Applicant felt that even if she liquidated her RRSP assets, she would still not be able to clear the outstanding balance which would continue to accrue interest and penalties. It was made clear to the Applicant that "hardship" in this context means an inability to feed, clothe and house one's self.
