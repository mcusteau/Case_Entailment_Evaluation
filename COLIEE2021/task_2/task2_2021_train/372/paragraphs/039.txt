In my view, the fact that the Applicant and his father did not make full inquiries and ascertain the situation in the U.S. before the Applicant left Pakistan is an insubstantial justification for a negative plausibility finding. The Board is imposing its own view of what it thought would have been a sensible approach to the situation and using this as a reason to doubt the Applicant's explanation that he didn't really appreciate the nature of the problem until he arrived in the U.S. If this finding was the whole basis for the Decision, it would be unsafe, but the Board goes on to make other findings and this issue cannot be viewed in isolation.
