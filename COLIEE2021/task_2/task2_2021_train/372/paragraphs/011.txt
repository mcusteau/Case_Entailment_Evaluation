The Board also drew a negative inference from the Applicant's failure to make a refugee claim in the U.S. However, as he explained at the hearing, he arrived in the U.S. shortly following the September 11, 2001 incident and feared he would not be considered for asylum because people from his part of the world were viewed as terrorists. The Applicant said he realized this fact only upon his arrival in the U.S. and after speaking to friends in that country. Further, his stay in the U.S. was very short and he spent little more than one week there before coming to Canada.
