 MEDICAL OPINION: 
 
 
 
 "There is no relationship between any of these conditions. Psychiatric disorders are not a risk factor for ASHD. The recognized risk factors are well known. GE Reflux is caused by laxity of the GE sphincter; it is not caused by, or in any way related to, any psychotic condition, and is not caused the calcium ion blocker Cardizem.(used in Rx of ASHD).
