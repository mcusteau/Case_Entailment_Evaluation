 [34] 
  In my opinion, the Board in no way determined that Dr. Sestier's opinion was not probable or credible. It simply concluded that it was not representative of the medical consensus on that issue. The Board did not comment on the lack of credibility or probability of the evidence. Therefore, in the absence of such a determination, the Board could not have rejected Dr. Sestier's opinion without having contradictory evidence before it, in accordance with s. 39 of the  
 VRAA
