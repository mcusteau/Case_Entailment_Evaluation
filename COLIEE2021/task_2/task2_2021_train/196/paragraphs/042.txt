  In my opinion, the very existence of s. 38 suggests that the Board does not have an inherent jurisdiction over medical matters. It does not have any particular medical expertise that would enable it to state without supporting evidence that Dr. Sestier's opinion and the article he adduced in this case were not part of the medical consensus. Therefore, I believe that the Board could not present medical facts that had not been adduced as evidence for the purpose of rebutting the applicant's evidence. If the Board required evidence other than that adduced by the applicant or evidence representing the medical context, it had only to invoke s. 38 and seek medical advice.
