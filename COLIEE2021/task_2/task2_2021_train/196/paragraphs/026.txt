 "The panel observed that Dr. Sestier addressed a few objections raised in the appeal panel's decision on the diagnosis of the condition under review since this time he clearly identified the appellant's condition as an arteriosclerotic disease. However, the panel is unable to find medical reports stating that the angor pectoris started in 1989. The first diagnosis of coronary disease in the file on the appellant's condition was made by Dr. Jacques Voyer, psychiatrist. 
 
 
 
 "The panel considers that the studies on which Dr. Sestier's opinions were based have not been integrated into recognized medical literature nor into medical reference books. Therefore, his opinion is not representative of the medical consensus on that issue. 
 
 
 
 "Moreover, the panel considered all of the risk factors the appellant demonstrated. It considered the appellant's advanced age at the time of the diagnosis. The panel is undoubtedly still of the view that the chronic anxiety for which the appellant is entitled to a pension did not accelerate the coronary disease. The pension entitlement is not indicated."
