Muldoon, J.
: This motion to compel answers occurs in the context of an originating notice filed by patentees, the original and principal applicants herein, for an order in accordance with regulation 6(1) of the
Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations
, SOR/93-133 (the
Regulations
). The requested order would prohibit the respondent Minister of National Health and Welfare (the Minister) from issuing a notice of compliance under s. C.08.004 of the
Food and Drug Regulations
to the respondent Novopharm. That respondent had, of course, sent to the applicants a notice of allegation which is dated July 30, 1993, in regard to the applicants' patents #1,166,248 (expiring April 24, 2001), #1,217,486 (expiring February 3, 2004), and #1,221,369 (expiring May 3, 2004). In that notice of allegation, the respondent alleged that "no claim for the medicine itself and no claim for the use of the medicine would be infringed by the making, constructing, using or selling of this drug" (nizatidine) "by Novopharm". The respondent alleges that the first and third patents are "covered" under Novopharm's compulsory licence #977, granted on October 21, 1991.
