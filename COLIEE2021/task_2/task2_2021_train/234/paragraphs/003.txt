No counsel sought to move the court to entertain the present motion's hearing "in camera". Nevertheless, the file is cluttered with brown manila envelopes sealed with gummed cellophane tapes and proclaiming the cover of the confidentiality order. They are an obstruction and a nuisance. There is no good reason to apply that order to these present proceedings, and the court, invoking paragraph 16 of that very confidentiality order, considers that it ought not be maintained in this regard. The court offered at the hearing of an earlier concurrent motion herein to discharge it entirely and, while the applicants' counsel stated his indifference to its fate, Novopharm's counsel expressed caution. Indeed the matter of the confidentiality order was not directly litigated in these proceedings, but that does not fetter the court's invocation of its paragraph 16, in the terms above expressed.
