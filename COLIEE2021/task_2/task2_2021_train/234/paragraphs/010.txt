It will be remembered that in their originating notice of motion the applicants assert that "none of the allegations made by Novopharm ... are [sic] justified for the following reasons:" among which are that Novopharm cannot act, until expiry of the limitations imposed by ss. 39.11 and 39.14, without infringing the applicants' patents. In regard, further, to the imposition effected by s. 39.14, the applicants assert that "in any event Novopharm is not the manufacturer of nizatidine identified in Novopharm's New Drug Submission".
