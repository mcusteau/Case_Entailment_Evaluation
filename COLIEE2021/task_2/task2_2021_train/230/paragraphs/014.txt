In concluding that the inversion sprain was not consequent to pensioned conditions, the Board referred at page 3 of its reasons to new evidence of Dr. Saunders tendered by the applicant at his hearing, but dismissed it as not credible:
"The report of Dr. Saunders, dated 5 July 2004 (EA-Y1) makes no reference to the historical, professional relationship between the Appellant and the doctor,
nor does it indicate whether or not the doctor physically examined the Appellant
, prior to writing his 5 July 2004 opinion. ... Although the doctor states that the Appellant's pes planus is likely a major contributing factor to his ankle instability and disability, he gives absolutely
no credible reason for arriving at that conclusion
. Therefore, the Board assigns very little probative value to Dr. Saunders' opinion." (Emphasis added)
