There is a great deal of evidence regarding the nature of the applicant's inversion sprains of the right ankle. In the Board's decision, the Board refers to the evidence of Dr. Scott Taylor, an orthopaedic surgeon at the Canadian Forces Hospital in Halifax. Dr. Taylor's first report dated December 14, 1998 states:
"... His (the applicant's) poor foot mechanics are going to predispose him to his ankle symptoms ..."
The poor foot mechanics being referred to by Dr. Taylor are the high arch of the applicant's feet when not weight bearing, but the fairly low arch with hyperpronation of the hind foot when weight bearing. This condition is the applicant's pes planus. Dr. Taylor's second report dated December 13, 1999 states:
"... Finally his right ankle pain, this gentleman had a previous inversion injury and has had chronic symptoms of functional instability since that time."
