  The applicant filed a grievance against the actions of the RCMP pursuant to s. 91 of the  
 PSSRA 
 . His grievance was stated as follows: 
 
 
 
 "I grieve that I have not been given formal notice within the time period required in the Long Term Specified Period Employment Policy; 
 
 
 
 AND I FURTHER GRIEVE 
 
 
 
 management's decision not to extend my term employment in order to avoid appointing me indeterminately as required by the Term Employment Policy which will come into force on April 1, 2003." 
 
 
 
 The final level of the grievance was before Vernon White, A/Commander, Assistant Chief Human Resources Officer. He dismissed the grievance. The relevant part of his decision is as follows: 
 
 
 
 "At no time were you given any commitment of indeterminate employment with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police as you were hired on a term basis to temporarily replace an indeterminate employee who was on an acting assignment. In March 2002, at the Assets and Procurements workshop, you were informed by management that, as a result of the reorganization, the Artisan positions would disappear. Following this workshop, management had several discussions with you regarding this matter where it was made clear to you that there would not be a position available for you beyond March 31, 2003. This decision was confirmed to you in a letter dated February 28, 2003. 
 
 
 
 "Consequently, I see no violation of the Term Employment Policy, I must deny your grievance and refuse the corrective action you have requested. (I Applicant's Application Record, page 21)." 
 
 
 
 It will be noted that A/Commander White does not address the "formal notification" question nor does he deal with the applicability of the 2003 policy, the matters actually grieved.
