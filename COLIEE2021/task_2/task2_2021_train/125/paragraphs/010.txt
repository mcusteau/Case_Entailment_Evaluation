  It appears to me, and the respondent agrees, (see respondent's record page 6, para. 19) that "formal notice" in this context means written notice, and that the applicant did not receive five weeks' written notice but only one month. The decision of the A/Commander, Assistant Chief Human Resources Officer was therefore incorrect because he did not address this issue which was the main subject of the grievance. Instead he dealt with the question of whether the applicant had ever been given reason to think that he would have an indeterminate appointment and the fact that he apparently had an oral indication that his final term appointment would not be renewed. This did not address the specific language of the Policy concerning the requirement of five weeks formal notification. Taking the position that he did, the grievance officer failed to consider what the consequences should be of the failure of the department to comply with the 1999 Policy.
