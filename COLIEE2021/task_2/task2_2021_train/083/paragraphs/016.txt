  The Applicant did not argue that the order under appeal addresses questions that are vital to the final issue of the case. Although the Prothonotary stated that certain issues raised in the proposed affidavit of Dr. Husain raise issues that are critical to the proceedings, it has not been argued that the Applicant’s ability to raise the issues by way of a reply affidavit is vital to the final issue of the case. The onus therefore remains on the Applicant to establish that the Prothonotary’s Order was clearly wrong.
