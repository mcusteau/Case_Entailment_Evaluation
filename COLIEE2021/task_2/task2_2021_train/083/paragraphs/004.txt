 [4] 
  The Applicant Pfizer argues that the Prothonotary’s Order is clearly wrong because the Prothonotary erred by importing a fourth requirement into the three-part test for granting leave to file reply evidence. Pfizer argues that there is a three part test for granting leave to file reply evidence in Patented Medicine (Notice of Compliance) (“PM(NOC)”) proceedings as established by Eli Lilly and Co. v. Apotex Inc. (1997), 76 C.P.R. (3d) 15 at 20-21 (F.C.T.D.) [“Eli Lilly”]. The Court has the discretion to grant an Applicant leave to file reply evidence if the Applicant demonstrates that the evidence it wishes to file: 
 
 
 
 a. would serve the interests of justice; 
 
 
 
 b. would assist the Court in making its final determination; 
 
 
 
 c. would not cause substantial or serious prejudice to the respondents.
