  It is true that it is not in every case that a person need approach the State for protection. When the evidence indicates that such protection would not be forthcoming, there is no requirements that the person seek the protection of the authorities. A claim should not be rejected based on a person's failure to seek State protection if the evidence supports the conclusion that no protection would be forthcoming (Ward, supra).
