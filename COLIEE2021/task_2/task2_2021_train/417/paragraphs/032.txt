While Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer was addressing irreparable harm within the context of the removal of the Grand Chief of the Mohawk Council of Kanesatake, I believe that the same considerations apply when considering the suspension and possible dismissal of two Councillors of the respondent Band Council. Like the situation in
Gabriel
, the position of a Councillor of the respondent Band is a political office to which the applicants have been elected by other members of the Sucker Creek First Nation. Removal from this office means that the applicants cannot speak out on behalf of those policies for which they were elected, either at Council meetings or within the community at large. Such a situation irreparably harms not only the applicants themselves, but also those individuals who elected them as their representatives in November 2006.
