On March 10, 2008, the applicants each received another letter from the respondents advising them that if they did not abide by the suspension decision, their pay would be suspended and a special meeting called to consider removing them from office. The letters provided for a "framework of investigation" and review, which outlined the process that the respondent Band would follow in assessing the plausibility of the allegations. As well, the letters outlined how the ultimate suspension decision was reached, stating at page 3:
On Friday, February 22, 2008, the Chief and Council met in Edmonton, at the Hilton Garden Suites Hotel to follow up the initial review of the letter of complaint.
Based on the information tabled, it was felt that it was in the interests of the Council's, our membership, and our community that both George Prince and Paulette Campiou be suspended pending an investigation of this letter of complaint.
The formal vote occurred and the motion passed as the votes all registered in the affirmative. As a result, both you, Paulette Campiou and George Prince are suspended from active duty as Councillors effective immediately with pay.
