I turn briefly to the Record, here in question, the evaluation report in relation to the applicant's Proposal for a tunnel project. Having reviewed that Record, I would describe it as a series of evaluations, assessing what is said to be the applicant's tunnel proposal against criteria, apparently established by PWC for particular aspects of the Proposal. Overall the assessments may not be seen as flattering to the applicant and I have no doubt the applicant would contest many aspects of the assessment. Nevertheless, there is nothing on the face of the Record that would lead one to conclude any of the information included in it is confidential by any objective measure. I note the Record does not relate to the applicant's financial plan for its project.
