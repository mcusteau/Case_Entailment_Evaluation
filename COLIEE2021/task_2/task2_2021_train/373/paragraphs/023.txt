[23]
For the applicant it is urged that amendment of its first Notice of Motion in Court File T-916-92, is authorized by rule 421(1) of the court's
Rules
which provides:
"421(1) A party may, without leave, amend any of his pleadings at any time before any other party has pleaded thereto."
In this case no "pleading" or response was filed to the original Notice of Motion filed on April 21, 1994, and the respondent took no action pursuant to rule 422 to disallow the amendment. The latter rule provides:
"422. Where any party has amended its pleading under rule 421(1), any other party may, within two weeks after the service on him of the amended pleading, apply to the court to disallow the amendment of any part thereof, and the court may, if satisfied that the justice of the case requires it, disallow the same."
