[16]
For the applicant the issues raised are stated as follows:
1. Are the records exempt from disclosure pursuant to s. 20(1)(c) and (d) of the
Act
?
2. Is the applicant's Proposal exempt from disclosure pursuant to paragraph 20(1)(b) of the
Act
?
3. Is the Notice of Motion in T-1133-92 out of time?
I propose to deal with the last of these issues first, modifying the scope and description of that issue, then to deal with the other issues.
Is The Decision To Disclose The
Applicant's Proposal Properly Before
The Court In These Proceedings?
