The oral hearing in respect of the first application was heard on July 25, 2006. At that time it was the position of the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration that the "decision" of March 7, 2005 was not justiciable because it was a preliminary assessment and not the final decision on the issue of inadmissibility. As of July 25, 2006, the second and third applications had been filed, but not perfected. After discussion between the Court and counsel, instructions were received whereby the parties agreed that the hearing of the first application would be adjourned, the responsible Minister would consent to the granting of leave in the second and third applications and the three applications would be heard together. In my view, this avoided potentially inconsistent results and brought the matters on for hearing on a timely and organized basis.
