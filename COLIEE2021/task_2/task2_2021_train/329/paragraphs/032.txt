Section 10 of IP 10 instructs officers that after the initial determination with respect to inadmissibility is made, and pending the decision on ministerial relief, an officer has discretion whether to issue a subsection 44(1) report. Thus, the issuance or non-issuance of a report does not alter or impact upon the effect of the decision with respect to inadmissibility.
