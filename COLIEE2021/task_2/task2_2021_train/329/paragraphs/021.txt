I frame the issues to be decided on these applications as follows:
1. Which admissibility decision ought to be reviewed by the Court, the one made on March 7, 2005 (first decision) or the one made on May 8, 2006 (second decision)?
2. What is the standard of review to be applied to the officer's decision with respect to Mr. Naeem's inadmissibility?
3. If the second decision is the one that is properly subject to judicial review, was Mr. Naeem denied fairness because he was not provided notice, or given any opportunity to respond to what is said to be new evidence, or to make submissions on admissibility?
4. Was the decision with respect to inadmissibility otherwise tainted by any reviewable error?
5. What is the standard of review to be applied to the Minister's decision on the application for ministerial relief?
6. What constitutes the reasons of the Minister for his negative decision?
7. Did the Minister err in law by failing to consider the national interest, or by relying on patently unreasonable findings of fact, or by ignoring evidence, or by making unreasonable inferences?
8. Is this an appropriate case for an award of costs?
