In view of my conclusion that the first decision was justiciable, some question may arise as to whether or not the second decision was in fact a decision. I do not believe it is necessary for me to decide the point because I am satisfied that any such decision can not stand in view of its inter-relationship with the two decisions that have been set aside. To the extent new matters were added by the officer, it would not be appropriate to sustain the decision on that basis when the new matters were added after Mr. Naeem had filed his submissions as to why the initial decision was inadequate and he was given no chance to respond. For clarity, an order will issue allowing the application for judicial review in the third application. Parenthetically, I note that it was at least implicit in the submissions of counsel that this would be the result if the decisions at issue in the first and second applications were set aside.
