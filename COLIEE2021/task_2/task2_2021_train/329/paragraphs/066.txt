Mr. Naeem seeks costs on two grounds. First, he notes that the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration did not oppose the granting of leave in the first application, but then took the position when filing his further memorandum of argument that the decision was not reviewable. Second, Mr. Naeem says that the conduct of the officer in attempting to correct the deficiencies in the first decision by making further observations in the second decision, without providing him an opportunity to respond, breaches the principles of fairness.
