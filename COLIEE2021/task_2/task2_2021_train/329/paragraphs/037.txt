In short, I accept that where a request for ministerial relief is made before the applicant has been advised that he is inadmissible and where the officer is satisfied that the applicant is inadmissible, the officer prepares the report described in section 9.2 of IP 10. Then, the applicant is not told of his inadmissibility and the application for permanent residence is held in abeyance pending the Minister's decision. However, the fact an application is held in abeyance does not detract from the justiciability of an officer's decision that, but for the exceptional exercise of Ministerial discretion, the applicant is inadmissible.
