As mentioned, a two-stage inquiry exists with respect to the residency requirement stipulated in paragraph 5(1)(c) of the Act. The case law indicates that applicants for citizenship must demonstrate that first, they have established a residence in Canada: see
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Italia
, 89 A.C.W.S. (3d) 22, [1999] F.C.J. No. 876 (T.D.) (QL), at paras. 14-16. This inquiry is the first stage of a two-part process in demonstrating whether an applicant has met the statutory residency requirement under the
Act
: see
Zhao v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship & Immigration)
, 2006 FC 1536, 306 F.T.R. 206, at para. 49. Indeed, the establishment of a residence in Canada is a condition precedent to obtaining citizenship. Where the evidence demonstrates that residence has not been established, inquiries as to whether residence has been maintained or evidence as to whether the applicant has centralized his mode of living in Canada become irrelevant: see
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration v. Tarfi
, 2009 FC 188, [2009] F.C.J. No. 244 (T.D.) (QL), at para. 35.
