Mr. Roberts returned to having no fixed address in Canada immediately upon the completion of the bar admissions course. Specifically, between 05 September 2003 and 31 July 2004, while employed as an articling student, Mr. Roberts admits that he had "no fixed abode" and that he slept in his car and sometimes overnight at the residence of friends. He adds that during this time he visited family in Buffalo every other week on Saturdays using a round-trip bus ticket.
