This argument is based on a wrong premise. It is not fairness, but the
Regulations
that impose a duty on a visa officer to determine whether the conditions of the definition are met. Under part (a) of the definition, an applicant has the option of seeking admission as "entrepreneur" on the basis of his intention and ability "to establish, purchase
or
make a substantial investment in a business or commercial venture in Canada". An applicant may well decide to base his application and submit evidence with regard to only one of the three options, in which case a visa officer need not, of course, examine the other options. In the case at bar, the applicant limited himself to allegations and evidence pertaining to the establishment of a business. The visa officer cannot be faulted for not having examined the other options, with respect to which there was simply no evidence.
