  The officer's reasons are sufficient so long as he gave an explanation to the applicant as to why he did not qualify as a Restaurant and Food Manager ( 
 Adu v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2005 FC 565 at para 14). While the officer's reasons may be brief ( 
 Ali v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2007 FC 283), they are clear and enable the applicant to understand why his application was rejected ( 
 VIA Rail Canada Inc. v. National Transportation Agency (C.A.) 
 , [2001] 2 F.C. 25): his reasons are adequate because they fulfill their function of allowing the applicant to know why he was refused ( 
 Nodijeh v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2007 FC 1217 at para 4 [
