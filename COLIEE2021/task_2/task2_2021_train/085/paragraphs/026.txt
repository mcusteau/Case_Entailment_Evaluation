  In  
 Kaur 
 , procedural fairness did not require the visa officer to notify the applicant of the inadequacies in the materials she had provided: the onus is on an applicant to submit sufficient evidence in support of his application ( 
 Kaur 
  at para 9). Therefore, in such cases, the applicant is not entitled to an interview to remedy his own shortcomings ( 
 Kaur 
  at para 9). Moreover, where the visa officer's concerns arise directly from the requirements of the legislation or regulations, he is under no duty to notify the applicant ( 
 Kaur 
  at para 11;  
 Rukmangathan v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2004 FC 284 at para 23). Relevant work experience is a concern that arises from the regulations: a visa officer is under no duty to mention his concerns as to the applicant's work experience ( 
 Kaur 
  at para 12). Ultimately, the visa officer has no obligation to make inquiries where the applicant's application is ambiguous: "there is no entitlement to an interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included" ( 
 Kaur 
  at para 10;  
 Sharma v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 , 2009 FC 786 at para 8 [ 
 Sharma 
 ] ;  
 Lam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
 ) (1998), 152 F.T.R. 316 at para 4). To hold otherwise would impose on visa officers an obligation to give advance notice of a negative finding of eligibility ( 
 Sharma 
  at para 8).
