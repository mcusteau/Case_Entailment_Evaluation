In my view, the statement of material circumstances must relate to the member being
unable
to take part in the disposition of the matter for reasons other than the lapse of eight weeks [see footnote 7]. This is one interpretation that gives substantive meaning to the words "at any time within eight weeks after that event, make, or take part in, the disposition of any matter" used by Parliament in s. 63(1). Other interpretations put into question the purpose and necessity of s. 63(1) as regards both the Chairperson's discretion and the eight week period. Parliament does not enact words for no purpose.
