Section 63 has been considered by the Appeal Division [see footnote 1] and the Trial Division [see footnote 2] of this court in more than several reported decisions but none prior to 1993 [see footnote 3]. The reasons underlying these different decisions vary. This divergence was well summarized by Reed, J., in
Brailko
at p. 131:
"As counsel suggested, two lines of authority appear to have developed after the decision in
Weerasinge
: one indicates that as long as an explanation is placed on the record, stating that the member's inability arose because that member ceased to hold office, this is sufficient to meet the purposes of 63(2). The other indicates that in circumstances where Board members know, at the time they participate in hearings, that they will not be available to take part in the decisions, there will be a breach of natural justice. Concomitantly, when it is clear from the record that Board members anticipate taking part in decisions before the expiration of their term, and then do not do so, a fuller explanation respecting the reason for that inability is required. A mere statement that the individual's term of office had expired will not suffice."
This situation will shortly be clarified as two of the trial decisions are currently under appeal [see footnote 4].
