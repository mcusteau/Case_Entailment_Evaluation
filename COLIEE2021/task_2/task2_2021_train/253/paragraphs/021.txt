In this case, Mr. Wakim purportedly acted pursuant to s. 63(2) without properly stating so. When he states that his reasons reflect the "... thinking of the panel when the decision was made", he likely refers to when he and Mr. Douglas agreed that the applicant should not be accepted as a refugee. However, that is not when the decision was made in any juridical sense. As Reed, J., aptly said in
Singh (Ricki) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1995), 104 F.T.R. 312 (T.D.), at p. 317: "As judges know, decisions often change with the writing of reasons". According to s. 63(2), Mr. Wakim alone was deemed to be the Tribunal on the date of decision which is said to be February 16, 1996 on the cover page of the reasons. The applicants have the right to a less ambiguous statement of circumstances for the decision not having been signed by the usual quorum of two members.
