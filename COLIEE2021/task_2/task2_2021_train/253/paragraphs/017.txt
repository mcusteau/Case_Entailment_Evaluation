Mr. Wakim asserts that Mr. Douglas "... participated in the disposition of the claim in accordance with s. 63(1) of the
Act
". He further advises that the portion of the reasons he himself wrote reflect "... the thinking of the panel when the decision was made". A proper understanding of these statements requires some speculation as to when Mr. Douglas participated in the disposition. However, even assuming an interpretation of the facts most consistent with the requirements of s. 63(1), in my view the decision cannot be saved.
