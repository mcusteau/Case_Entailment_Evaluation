  Ms. Uanseru submits that this note demonstrates that the only reason considered by the Officer in deciding that the cash bond should be forfeited was the fact that Mr. Mark breached one of the conditions of his release. This view is confirmed, she says, when regard is had to the decision letter, where the Officer finds that there has been a breach of a condition of release, and goes on to state "As such, it is my decision to forfeit the $5,000 cash bond".
