  Before leaving this issue, I would like to note that while the actions of the respondent in this case seem a little harsh, given that Mr. Mark's breach of a condition of his release seems to be little more than technical in nature, I see no basis for Ms. Uanseru's argument that the respondent acted in bad faith in this case.
