 Mactavish, J. 
 : Gina Uanseru seeks judicial review of the decision of an Acting Operations Officer at the Greater Toronto Enforcement Centre that a cash bond in the amount of $5,000 be forfeited. Ms. Uanseru contends that the Officer erred in finding that there had been a breach of any of the conditions secured by the bond. In the alternative, in the event that there was such a breach, Ms. Uanseru submits that the Officer erred in failing to properly exercise her discretion when she caused the bond to be forfeited.
