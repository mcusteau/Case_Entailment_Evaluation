  After his release from detention, Mr. Mark resided with Ms. Uanseru, although he spent some nights with his common-law wife and the couple's infant child. Given that the Order for Release did not stipulate that he was to reside in one place at all times, the respondent acknowledges that Mr. Mark was entitled to stay overnight at his wife's home on occasion.
