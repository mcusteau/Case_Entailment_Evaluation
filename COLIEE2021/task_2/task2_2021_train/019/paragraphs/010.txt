 [10] 
  On September 10, 2004, while Mr. Johnson was en route to the RPD, he received a call from his counsel indicating that counsel would not be able to attend the hearing due to a family emergency. Specifically, counsel had been required to take his son to a hospital emergency department the previous night and had not returned home until the early hours of September 10, 2004. Counsel advised Mr. Johnson that he would contact the RPD to inform them about his situation, but that Mr. Johnson should still proceed to the RPD.
