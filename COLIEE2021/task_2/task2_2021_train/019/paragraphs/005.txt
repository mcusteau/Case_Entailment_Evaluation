 [5] 
  I will deal with the issues raised by the Minister's motion in the following order: 
 
 
 
 1. Should the decision of the RPD be set aside? 
 
 
 
 2. If so, on what terms should the application be allowed and should any direction be given by the Court to the RPD? 
 
 
 
 3. Is an award of costs appropriate?
