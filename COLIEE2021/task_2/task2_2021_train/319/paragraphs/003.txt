A preliminary issue was argued before me at the opening of the judicial review hearing. The sole affidavit filed in support of the applicant's application for judicial review was that of his solicitor of record. The affidavit attested to the filing of the applicant's application for permanent residence in Canada under the category "assisted relative" as members of the family class and annexed his application as an exhibit. It further attested to the submission of the undertaking of assistance, annexed that document, and attested to the acknowledgment of receipt of the undertaking of assistance, also annexed. It attested to the fact that the applicant was invited to a personal interview and annexed a copy of the invitation letter. It attested to the fact that the applicant attended the interview and that he thereafter informed his solicitor that the visa officer " ... was fully satisfied with the applicant's answers, and congratulated him." The applicant's letter to his solicitor in this regard, setting out the applicant's report of the interview, was also annexed as an exhibit. Finally, the affidavit attested to the rejection of the applicant's application and annexed a copy of the rejection letter. The paragraph referring to the applicant's report of his interview was numbered six in the affidavit and the related copy of a written report was exhibit E to the affidavit. I will refer to these elements of the affidavit and exhibits as "paragraph 6 and exhibit E".
