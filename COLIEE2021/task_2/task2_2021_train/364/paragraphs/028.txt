They have not identified the evidence they wish to bring forward in defence, or the witnesses they need. The Court has not been told who owns the ship and whether it was on charter. If on charter, is there a charter party by demise, one or more time charters, and who was responsible for stowage? Where are the crew members to be located? How was the container secured on deck? Did eye-pads give way? Is there any evidence left? Have master mariners, naval architects, metallurgists, surveyors and weather experts been retained? If so, by whom, and where are they to be found? Are there any gaps or unexplained areas in Hong Kong law, or in the
Hague Rules
as applied by U.S. courts? Both jurisdictions are in the common law tradition. There is no evidence that anyone involved in the loading, stowing or carriage of the cargo lives in Hong Kong. Indeed as a NVOCC, presumably Blue Anchor Line had no physical involvement whatsoever. At most it may have retained an agent to stuff the container in Taiwan.
