Thus, without taking into account s. 46 of the
Marine Liability
Act
, this Court has jurisdiction over the defendants if they were properly served. The
Federal Courts Rules
provide that a Statement of Claim is to be personally served. They were purportedly personally served within Canada. Despite their mumblings, the Defendants have not moved to have the service set aside and so I shall act on the assumption that service was valid. Certainly if defects of this nature are to be relied upon they should be acted upon promptly.
