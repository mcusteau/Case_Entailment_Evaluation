The other defendants, the Moving Parties in the motion before me, were all served at the offices of Kuehne & Nagel Ltd. in Montr√©al. The service on Kuehne & Nagel Ltd. was service effected at one of its offices and is clearly valid. The plaintiffs claim that Kuehne & Nagel Ltd. is the agent of Kuehne & Nagel Inc. and of Blue Anchor Line, neither of whom it must be said is Canadian. Federal Courts Rule 130 allows personal service on a corporation by leaving the document with the person apparently in charge of the branch or agency in Canada where service was effected. The validity of that service is not before me. As the Moving Parties state in their Notice of Motion "notwithstanding the issue of whether or not service of the Statement of Claim was properly effected on all the defendants, these defendants wish to object to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court." They seek a stay in favour of Hong Kong, or alternatively New York.
