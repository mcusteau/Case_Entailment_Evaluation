As stated in the Bill of Lading, U.S.
COGSA
gives effect to the
Hague Rules
. So does Canada but now with the addition of the
Visby Protocol
. There is no evidence in this case, unlike in
The Cougar Ace
, that U.S. law is undeveloped when it comes to applying the
Hague Rules
. If U.S.
COGSA
has to be proved as a fact, it has to be proved just as much in Hong Kong as in Canada. No suggestion has been led that U.S. law differs from Canadian law except for the customary freight unit limitation of liability as indeed expressly stated in the Bill of Lading. Both Canadian and U.S. law derive from the
Brussels Convention
of 1924.
