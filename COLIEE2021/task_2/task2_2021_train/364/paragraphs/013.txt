To round out the relevant documents, Hanjin Shipping Co. Ltd. (a well-known firm whose precise role in this affair is not set out) wrote to Shipco Transport Inc. to say that it had been informed by Yang Ming Marine Transport, "the owners/operators" of m/v YM Prosperity, that the ship had encountered heavy weather and that the container in which the cargo was stowed was lost overboard or heavily damaged. Shipco Transport Inc. passed on that message the following day. In their affidavit in support of the stay, the Defendants state that the container was lost overboard.
