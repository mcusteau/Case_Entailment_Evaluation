 Harrington, J. 
 : One of the great hallmarks of our society is our open court system. Justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. Hearings are open to the public and documents produced in litigation are normally subject to public scrutiny. I say normally because we do not live in a world of absolutes. There are reasonable exceptions to just about every reasonable rule.
