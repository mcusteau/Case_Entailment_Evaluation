  Federal Court Rule 151 permits the Court, in its discretion, to treat some material as confidential, and restrict access thereto, notwithstanding the public interest in open and accessible court proceedings. In accordance with that Rule, Prothonotary Milczynski issued an order protecting the confidentiality of certain documents and information the applicants ("Merck" in the plural) expect to produce in this case. The respondent Apotex has appealed that order. It submits that there is no need for it. In the alternative, it submits that the order is too restrictive. More particularly, Apotex argues that the Prothonotary was wrong in law in issuing a "counsel's eyes only" order which denies it access to some of Merck's documents and which interferes in its solicitor-client relationship, another hallmark of our rule of law. Apotex also contests the restrictions put on any expert consultant it may retain. In essence Merck has to approve the appointment before the documents and information subject to the protective order are disclosed to the expert. If the parties cannot resolve their differences, the order, as it currently stands, places the burden on Merck to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Court why the protected documents and information should not be shown to the expert.
