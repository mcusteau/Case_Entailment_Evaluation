  I am satisfied that Prothonotary Milczynski did not exercise her discretion upon wrong principles in granting the protective order. My concern is with the "counsel's eyes only" aspect of the order, as well as the requirement that Apotex identify its experts and obtain either Merck's approval, or, if Merck insists, a Court order, before disclosing confidential documents and information to them.
