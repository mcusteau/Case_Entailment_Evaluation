  These "bald" statements may well support the need for a protective order, but they in no way justify interference with the normal solicitor-client relationship, and the right of a party in litigation to consult with outside experts. I must conclude, at least in these respects, that Prothonotary Milczynski misdirected herself on the law. No basis was put forward to support Merck's fear that employers of Apotex, or any outside expert hired by it, would make the confidential information available to the public, and especially to Merck's competitors. I can see merit in issuing an order similar to that in the United States which covers the same or similar patents in a case involving the same parties. However, Apotex is not party thereto and so cannot be said to be using Canadian litigation to circumvent a U.S. protective order.
