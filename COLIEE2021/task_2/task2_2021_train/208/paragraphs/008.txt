  "Counsel's eyes only" confidentiality orders are not unknown but they are highly unusual. In  
 Apotex Inc. and Novopharm Ltd. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd. 
  (1993), 69 F.T.R. 161; 51 C.P.R.(3d) 505 (T.D.), MacKay, J., identified three considerations which favoured the grant of such an order in that case. The first was that the terms reflected the terms of protective orders granted upon consent in parallel litigation in the United States in which the same parties were directly or indirectly involved. There is merit in having reasonably comparable protective orders in parallel litigation. In this case there is litigation under way in the United States and a protective order similar to the one granted by Prothonotary Milczynski is in place. It is important to note however that Apotex is not party thereto.
