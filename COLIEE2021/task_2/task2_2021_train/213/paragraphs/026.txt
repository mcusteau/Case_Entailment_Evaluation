 [26] 
  In the case at bar, it is primarily on the basis of the wording of the respondent's grievance that the court must determine whether the allegation he made at adjudication so altered his original grievance as to change its nature and make it a new grievance. For this purpose, it should be noted that the respondent's original grievance challenged the decision to "terminate" his employment, asked that he be reinstated in his position or a comparable position with compensation for damage and financial losses and that appropriate action be taken to alleviate the damage his dismissal had done to his reputation.
