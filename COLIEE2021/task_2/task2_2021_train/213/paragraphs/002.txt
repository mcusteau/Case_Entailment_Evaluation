  The facts as presented by the applicant in her memorandum are not in dispute. Following a major reorganization at the Canadian Space Agency, the respondent was told on September 6, 1995 that the position he held [see footnote 1] had been abolished. As a result of that decision, the respondent was given notice that he would be declared surplus for the period from November 8, 1995 to May 7, 1996 and that he would be laid off at the end of that period if he had not found another position in the public service.
