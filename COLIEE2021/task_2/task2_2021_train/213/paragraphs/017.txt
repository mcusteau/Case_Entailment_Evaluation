  Contrary to the applicant's submission, no statutory amendment has limited this principle. The addition to the  
 Public Service Staff Relations Act 
  of s. 92(3), which bars the adjudication of a grievance with respect to a termination of employment under the  
 Public Service Employment Act 
 , does not remove jurisdiction from the Adjudicator solely because such a termination of employment is relied on by the employer. Section 92(3) clearly bars a referral to adjudication only where there was in fact a termination of employment under that  
 Act 
 . The hypothesis on which the Adjudicator based her decision in fact concerns a situation in which an employer disguises an unlawful dismissal under cover of the abolishment of a position through a contrived reliance on that  
 Act 
 . Such a situation would clearly fall within the jurisdiction conferred on adjudicators by s. 92(1)(b) of the  
 Public Service Staff Relations Act 
 .
