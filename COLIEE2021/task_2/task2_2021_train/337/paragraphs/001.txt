Dawson, J.
: Mr. Ceymour Johnson's inland application for permanent residence in Canada was refused because he was found to be inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality. The criminal convictions that led to the finding of inadmissibility were later set aside. Mr. Johnson brings this application for judicial review of the decision refusing his application for permanent residence.
