Mr. Johnson relies upon the decision of my retired colleague, Mr. Justice Muldoon, in
Nagra v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1996] 1 F.C. 497 (T.D.), to argue that the decision on inadmissibility cannot continue to stand in the face of the decision overturning the underlying criminal conviction. In my view, this decision does not assist Mr. Johnson.
