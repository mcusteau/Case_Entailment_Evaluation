A deportation order has a clear and imminent effect upon a person's right to remain in Canada. If, in that context, there is no obligation to await the result of an appeal of a criminal conviction, it is my view that there can be no obligation to defer consideration of a humanitarian and compassionate application because of an outstanding appeal. This is so because one may file a new inland application for permanent residence if circumstances later change as a result of a successful appeal.
