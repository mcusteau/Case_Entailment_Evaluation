[29]
While, on the application for judicial review of the decision of the IAD, the Court incidentally set aside the removal order, the Court noted, at paragraph 27, that pending the new criminal trial "the applicant is not shown to have completed the second stage for obtaining permanent residence, because of the then quite legitimate report under subsection 27(2)" of the Act. I take from this that the setting aside of the criminal conviction did not affect the validity of the report about inadmissibility.
Did the officer breach the duty of fairness he owed by failing to provide Mr. Johnson with an opportunity to respond to his criminal convictions?
