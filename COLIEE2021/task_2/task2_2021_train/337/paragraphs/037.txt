Counsel for Mr. Johnson posed the following questions for certification:
1. Is there some discretion in the second stage of a humanitarian and compassionate application?
2. Given the length of time it takes to complete humanitarian and compassionate applications and the ongoing variability of such applications is there not some duty on the officer to advise the applicant of information he relies upon in coming to his decisions?
