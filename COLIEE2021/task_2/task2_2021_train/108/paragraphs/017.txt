  Such practice will also be of value and assistance to the often self-represented prospective appellant by sparing him or her sterile speculation in this respect. In the present case, the decision was the first one made by the Commissioner among those subjected to judicial review and all three of the other cases referred to above pertained to decisions which were made by the Commissioner in the same approximate time period. As mentioned above, (see para. 11) Justice Lemieux found in  
 Pentney 
  that the Commissioner had indeed identified and attempted to apply the correct legal test. Justice Hugues in  
 Schneider 
  and Justice Shore in  
 Berhe 
  equally found this to be the case. In light of this, the Court may reasonably infer that the same test was used by the Commissioner in making the decision presently before the Court as the one used in the decisions reviewed by Justices Lemieux, Hughes and Shore, particularly in light of the reference to a reasonable explanation and the notion of arguable case in the Certified Record. However, in different circumstances, the Commissioner seriously runs the risk of a decision such as the one presently before the Court being set aside on the basis of inadequate reasons.
