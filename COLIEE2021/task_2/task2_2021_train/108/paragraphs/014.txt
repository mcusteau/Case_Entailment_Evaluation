  As for the third case,  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Berhe 
 , [2008] F.C.J. No. 1201; 2008 FC 967, (QL) ( 
 Berhe 
 ), like his colleagues, Justice Michel M.J. Shore held that the four-prong test discussed in  
 Pentney 
  was applied by the Commissioner. In addition, the Commissioner in that instance had before him at the time of his decision a medical opinion regarding the respondent's condition. He found that the Commissioner had based his acceptance on the fact that: i) explanations had been given as to the delay, which was attributed to language barriers and the fact that medical evidence was received at a late date; and, ii) the respondent had an arguable case to be found to have been disabled as of the relevant date.
