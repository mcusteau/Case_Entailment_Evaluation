  In the second case,  
 Schneider 
 , Justice Hughes found that while the Commissioner has the obligation to consider factors such as those set out in  
 Grewal v. Minister of Employment and Immigration 
 , [1985] 2 F.C. 263; 63 N.R. 106 (F.C.A.) [see footnote 1] ( 
 Grewal 
 ), he must also "look at the factual circumstances of each case" (para. 5). As for the duty to provide reasons, which is incumbent upon the Commissioner, he noted that it does not oblige him "to set out detailed reasons and articulate jurisprudence or criteria derived from jurisprudence and provide a detailed review as to the application of all facts to each criteria" (para. 10). As in  
 Pentney 
 , Justice Hughes found that the Commissioner had used the correct test. On the facts of this second matter, the decision of the Commissioner was found to be reasonable and the application was dismissed.
