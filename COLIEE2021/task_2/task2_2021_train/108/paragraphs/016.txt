  This means that, as illustrated by  
 Jakutavicius 
 , the Commissioner should at minimum adopt the practice of stating the test it applied by simply referring to a decision in which it is articulated, such as  
 Pentney 
 . In addition, the Commissioner should state which of the four factors set out in this test he found to be determinative in the exercise of his discretion as well as any other case specific factors he found determinative. As noted by Justice Lemieux in  
 Pentney 
 , it will also be open to the Court reviewing the decision to consider recommendations received by the Commissioner from his staff in order to complement the formal reasons contained in his decision communicated to the parties. To require the Commissioner to adopt such practice is perfectly in line with the extent of the duty to provide reasons as described by Justice Hughes in  
 Schneider 
  for it does not impose, in the Court's view, an unreasonable administrative burden on the Commissioner and constitutes the bare minimum which is generally necessary in order for the Court to exercise its jurisdiction on judicial review.
