For similar reasons, I believe that the provisions of paragraph 44(f) of the
Interpretation Act
, quoted above, support this interpretation of the current Pension Act provisions. When the 1987 amendments were made to the
Pension Act
in respect of former prisoners of war or evaders, there is nothing to suggest that a provision such as s. 71.2(4) of the
Pension Act
was to operate as new law. It is not necessary to so interpret the very general adoption by reference of s. 39 of the
Pension Act
to prisoners compensation so as to repeal a former entitlement to 11 years of benefits by persons in the position of the applicants in this case. Parliament was assured that any change in substance was to be for the better and not for the worst. I therefore do not consider that s. 71.2(4) should be taken to operate as new law in this respect.
