The history of this matter suggests to me that most if not all members of Parliament participating in the enactment of the 1987 amendment to the
Pension Act
would have been most surprised and, I suspect, seriously concerned, if they had been told that persons in the position of the applicants in this case, if they had a chance to learn of their entitlement, would be precluded in future from receiving benefits retroactive to April 1, 1976, which they would have received had they applied prior to the 1987
Act
.
