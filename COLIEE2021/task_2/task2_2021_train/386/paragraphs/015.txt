The history of the passage of the 1976
Act
indicates rather clearly that, in the House of Commons, one of the principal concerns by members on both sides of the House was as to the date from which former prisoners of war could start collecting monthly compensation. The Bill as originally presented provided for it to come into force on proclamation. A question was put to the sponsoring Minister as to what would be the effective date of the payments. The Minister replied "It would be hard for me to say for sure, but I suggest that the effective date for payments will be when the legislation comes into effect" (

February 26, 1976 at 11277). There continued to be concern about this during debate and when the Bill went to Committee only one amendment was made there, to the effect that the Bill would be deemed to have come into effect on April 1, 1976, although it was not enacted until several weeks after that (see
Commons Debates Hansard
, April 2, 1976, at 12414). A perusal of the Committee debates indicates that it was the concern of the Committee that entitlement to payment should be effective retroactively to a date prior to actual enactment.
