[12]
It appears to me that the essential issues raised by this appeal are:
(1) Did the 1976
Act
, as amended in 1987, entitle applicants who otherwise met the definitions of prisoner of war or evader, to periodic payments commencing April 1, 1976 regardless of when they applied?
(2) If the answer to (1) is "yes", then did Parliament intend, through the 1987 amendments to the
Pension Act
, to terminate that entitlement for future applicants and limit it to the period following a successful application?
