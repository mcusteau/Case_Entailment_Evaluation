This situation obtained until 1987 when these
Acts
were replaced by amendments to the
Pension Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. 37. Amending
Act
, S.C. 1987, c. 45, provided for a continuing compensation scheme for prisoners of war and evaders payable as a pension. It was nevertheless still described as "compensation". The definition of "prisoner of war" was expanded to include evaders. The new s. 71.2(4) added to the
Pension Act
provides as follows:
"(4) In the determination of the entitlement of a prisoner of war to compensation, the applicable provisions of Part III, excluding subsections 38(4) to (8), apply, with any modifications that the circumstances require, as if a reference in those provisions to a member of the forces or a pensioner were a reference to a prisoner of war and as if a reference to a pension or a pension for disability were a reference to compensation."
"4) Les dispositions applicables de la partie III, à l'exception des paragraphes 38(4) à (8), s'appliquent, avec les adaptations nécessaires, au calcul de l'indemnité à laquelle les prisonniers de guerre on droit, comme si les termes 'membre des forces' ou 'pensionné' signifiaient 'prisonnier de guerre' et 'pension' ou 'pension pour invalidité', 'indemnité'."
