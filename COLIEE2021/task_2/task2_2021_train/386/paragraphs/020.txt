I believe that by the general cross-reference in s. 71.2(4) of the
Pension Act
to most sections of Part III of that
Act
, making them applicable to compensation, Parliament cannot be taken to have made a specific decision to reduce the compensation payable to former prisoners of war or evaders who happened not to have applied before because they did not know they were entitled to compensation. It would have been legally, if perhaps not politically, easy to so provide in the amendments if that was intended. In the circumstances, s. 39(1) must be taken as inappropriate in reference to prisoners compensation and the qualification in s. 71.2(4) of the applicability of Part III "with any modifications that the circumstances require" to prisoners' compensation must be taken to mean that s. 39(1) is not applicable.
