On the matter of costs, rule 1618 of the
Federal Court Rules
permits an order for costs in a judicial review only where special reasons exist. Despite the cogent arguments advanced by counsel for the applicant, I am not convinced that the actions of the Minister were such as to intentionally delay proceedings nor were they so unreasonable as to be considered judicially inappropriate. Furthermore, I am not able to conclude that the conduct complained of was purposely directed at preventing the applicant from exercising his legal rights. The mere fact that the Minister relied strictly on his legal rights does not constitute special reasons. It follows therefore, that I made no order as to costs on this application for judicial review.
