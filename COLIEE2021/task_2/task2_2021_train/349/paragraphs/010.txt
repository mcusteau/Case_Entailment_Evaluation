By a letter dated April 25, 1994 the offer to settle was refused, but the applicant agreed to settle upon further terms: that the Minister responsible agree to grant the applicant a visa, subject only to security clearance and a medical; that the applicant be paid the sum of $1,000.00 to cover costs emanating from the visa officer's delay in responding to the request for reconsideration and the costs for the motion to extend the time to file the judicial review application, which the respondent opposed on March 22, 1994. The respondent reiterated, on May 6, 1994, an interest in settling the matter on essentially the original terms of April 20, 1994. Again, the applicant refused to settle and the matter was brought on for judicial review.
