I have no doubt that the errors committed by the visa officer in completing her assessment of the applicant's application, particularly as it relates to her allotment of points in the occupational category, was an error of law and did not satisfy the requirements of s. 8(2) of the
Regulations
. There was also a failure to grant the applicant an opportunity to disabuse the visa officer's concerns as to his experience in the field of electrical engineering. As a result, the decision of the visa officer must be quashed and the applicant's application must be revisited by a different visa officer in accordance with the law as outlined in
Saggu
. The Minister cannot be forced to exercise a discretionary power in the applicant's favour, as it remains to be seen whether the applicant has complied with the provisions of the
Act
and the
Regulations
. Nor is there justification to fetter the discretion of the reviewing visa officer:
Uy v. Minister of Employment and Immigration (M.E.I.)
, [1991] 2 F.C. 201; 121 N.R. 248 (F.C.A). To ensure fairness to the applicant it should be reviewed as of January 22, 1993, as was conceded by the Minister.
