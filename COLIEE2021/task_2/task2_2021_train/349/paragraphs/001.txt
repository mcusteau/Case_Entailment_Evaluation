Jerome, A.C.J.
: This is an application pursuant to s. 18.1 of the
Federal Court Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7, as amended, for an order by way of certiorari quashing the decision of Carol Turner, visa officer at the Canadian Embassy in Bucharest, Romania, refusing the applicant's request for permanent residence in Canada; for a writ of mandamus directing that the respondent assess the applicant under the occupational category of "electrical engineer, general" and proceed to issue a visa to the applicant subject to a medical and security clearance; and an order for costs in the amount of $1,000.00. The matter came on for hearing before me on November 14, 1994 at which time I allowed the application in part for reasons given orally and indicated that written reasons would follow.
