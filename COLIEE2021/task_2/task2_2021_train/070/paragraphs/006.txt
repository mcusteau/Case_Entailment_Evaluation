  The standard of review of credibility findings, which is at the heart of this PRRA decision, is patent unreasonableness. With respect to findings on specific facts, the Federal Court Act s. 18.1(4)(d) sets the standard as "an erroneous finding of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it".
