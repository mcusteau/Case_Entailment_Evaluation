  In a decision dated August 25, 2010, Mr. Wilson's complaint was upheld, in part. The CSC accepted that Mr. Wilson's community assessment had been concluded prior to the completion of the psychological assessment and that the CSC had failed to follow the proper procedure in this regard. However, the CSC also held that the absence of the psychological assessment was not material, as the psychological assessment did not support his request for release. Mr. Wilson did not grieve this decision.
