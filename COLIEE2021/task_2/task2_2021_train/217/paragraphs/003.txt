  Mr. Wilson has long been trying to have the reasons of his sentencing judge added to his institutional files and to have other, allegedly inaccurate, information removed from his files. This information relates to events leading up to Mr. Wilson's conviction for manslaughter, and his alleged involvement in the drug trade in Springhill Institution. According to Mr. Wilson, this inaccurate information played a role in the decision of the National Parole Board to deny him day parole on two occasions.
