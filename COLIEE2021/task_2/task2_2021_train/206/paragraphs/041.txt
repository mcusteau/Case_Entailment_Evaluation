  Because the case of  
 Cervenakova 
 , above, was released on the day of oral submissions in this case, I allowed parties to make further written submissions on how the decision in  
 Cervenakova 
  could impact on this judicial review. Both parties provided comments. The Applicants drew to my attention a reference in the decision to "a further inflammatory remark made by the Minister" and provided arguments on how this remark could be seen to raise a reasonable apprehension of bias. I have disregarded this attempt to augment the record before me in this case. However, even if I were inclined to consider this new evidence, it would not change my decision in this judicial review.
