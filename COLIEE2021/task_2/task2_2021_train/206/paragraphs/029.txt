  The Applicants claim that they did ask for documents at the time of the alleged sterilization but were refused and that the Board's statements that "she did not try" to obtain the supporting document were wrong in fact. I do not agree with the Applicants' interpretation of the Board's reasons on this point. A review of the reasons make it clear that the Board understood that the Female Applicant had asked for and been refused a copy of the document at the time of the surgery. However, the point made by the Board is that she did not ask for the hospital documentation for purposes of this hearing. Moreover, the Board also noted that the Applicants could have requested corroborating documentation from her treating psychologist "who was in fact helping her". In the absence of any corroborating documentation, the Board's inference was not unreasonable.
