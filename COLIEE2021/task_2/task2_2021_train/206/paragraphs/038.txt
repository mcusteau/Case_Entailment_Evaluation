  Nevertheless, I do accept that the failure to refer to a specific and critical document (such as an individual's psychological report) may raise a presumption that the Board did not consider the document ( 
 Cepeda-Gutierrez 
 , above, at para. 16). However, on the facts before me, the documentary evidence cited by the Applicants was not directed to the Applicants personally. The Board, in its reasons, demonstrated that it had read and understood the nature of the contrary documentary evidence and provided an adequate explanation of the basis upon which the decision was reached. I conclude that the evidence referred to by the Applicants was not ignored.
