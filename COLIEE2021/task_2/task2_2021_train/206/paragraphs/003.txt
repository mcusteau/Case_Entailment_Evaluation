  In a decision dated March 16, 2009, the Board determined that there were no grounds for the allegation of a reasonable apprehension of bias. In addition, having considered the balance of the evidence before it, the Board concluded that the Applicants were neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection under  
 IRPA 
 . In addition to some concerns about credibility of the Principal Applicant and his wife, the Board concluded that the Applicants had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection.
