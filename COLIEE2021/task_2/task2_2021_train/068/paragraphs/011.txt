  In my view, the right of appeal from a decision of the Minister under s. 84(2) on new facts is not a substitute or an alternative to the right of appeal from the Minister's original decision. The purpose of s. 84(2) is to empower the Minister to reconsider his original decision on the basis of new facts, and s. 82(1) now provides for a right of appeal against a decision rendered by the Minister on the basis of new facts. It follows that this right of appeal can only be exercised if the Minister decides to reconsider his original decision in light of new facts. If the Minister, in the exercise of his discretion under s. 84(2), concludes to the absence of any new facts which would warrant a reconsideration of the original decision, no fresh decision can be said to have been rendered and no right of appeal lies under s. 82(1). However, if the Minister decides that the new facts warrant a reconsideration of his original decision, a fresh decision will result under s. 84(2) as it will be based on facts different from those under consideration when the original decision was rendered, and a right of appeal lies under s. 82(1). This is the result whether or not the original decision is amended, rescinded or is allowed to stand as originally rendered. A decision based on new facts is a fresh decision irrespective of whether the original decision is allowed to stand or not.
