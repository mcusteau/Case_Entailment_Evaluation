  The statutory scheme provides for an appeal as of right from the Minister's original determination that no benefit is payable. That determination becomes final and conclusive unless the right of appeal is exercised within twelve months after the month during which applicant receives notification thereof. Beyond that period, s. 84(2) allows the Minister, on his own volition, to rescind or amend his original decision at any time on the basis of new facts, and s. 82(1) now provides the applicant with an appeal from such a decision which must be exercised within ninety days of the notification of the Minister's decision.
