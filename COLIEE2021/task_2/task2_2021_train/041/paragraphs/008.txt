  In the present case, I agree with Apotex that the respondent's trademark application is confusing and ambiguous and that this is the result of the presence of both dotted lines, which have been disclaimed, and solid lines which have not been disclaimed, in the representations of the tablets. Although the application disclaims the hexagonal shape of the tablet, the Registrar of Trademarks failed to take this disclaimer into account in his decision nor does he indicate which part of the shape of the tablet was claimed as the trademark and which part was disclaimed. In fact, the impugned decision appears to assume that the trademark was for the colour and shape of the tablet, even though Monsanto's application states that it is not claiming rights in hexagonal tablets. Subsequently however, in its Reply to the Notice of Appeal and the evidence filed, the respondent does rely on the hexagonal shape of the tablet and the colour as being the trademark. There is considerable doubt in my mind therefore whether Monsanto's trademark application complies with the requirements of the  
 Trade-Marks Act
