 [12] 
  Rule 312(a) of the  
 Federal Court Rules, 1998 
  allows this court to grant to a party leave to file affidavits additional to those authorized under rules 306 and 307. The tests for determining whether leave should be granted is whether it would serve the interest of justice, will assist the court and will not cause serious or substantial prejudice to other parties. This court has granted leave to file a reply affidavit where the other party could not have anticipated that the opposing party would introduce fresh evidence [see footnote 10]. In this case, the judicial review presiding judge, with the assistance of the reply affidavit and the cross-examinations, will be in a better position to determine whether or not the Associate Deputy Minister made the right decision.
