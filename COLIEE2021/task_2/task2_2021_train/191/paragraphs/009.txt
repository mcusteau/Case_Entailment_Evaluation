  It would appear that this voluminous affidavit and exhibits attached thereto are produced as background information concerning the issues raised by the applicant's grievance. Most likely the Associate Deputy Minister is already familiar with much of this information. It does not appear to be new information that would prejudice the case of the applicant. In his affidavit, Dr. Lachance outlines the factual background leading to his decision and that of the Associate Deputy Minister. He describes the mandate and organization of the Bureau of Veterinary Drugs, the duties of the employees of that Bureau, the process whereby new veterinary drugs submissions are reviewed and current initiatives to improve the performance of the Bureau. The applicant being himself an employee of the Bureau would have knowledge of these matters. Obviously, that general background information could be of assistance to the judge presiding over the judicial review.
