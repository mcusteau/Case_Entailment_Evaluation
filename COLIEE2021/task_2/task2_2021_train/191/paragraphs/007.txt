 [7] 
  This court has struck out affidavits, or portions of them, which are abusive or clearly irrelevant, where a party has filed evidence which in fact is obviously inadmissible or where a court is convinced that admissibility would be better resolved at an early stage so as to allow the hearing to proceed in an orderly manner [see footnote 8]. The courts have also struck affidavits which contain opinion, argument or legal conclusions [see footnote 9] or would cause undue delay.
