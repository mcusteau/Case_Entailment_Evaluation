  On the other hand, there is also jurisprudence to the effect that the court has no jurisdiction to strike out affidavits by way of motion in anticipation of a judicial review proceedings. The appropriate procedure is to leave the affidavit for evaluation by the judge who hears the application on the merits [see footnote 5]. Judicial review is a summary procedure, the focus of which is advancing the application along to the hearing stage as expeditiously as possible. The ultimate adequacy of the allegations and evidence must be addressed by the judge hearing the application on its merits [see footnote 6]. There is an exceptional discretion to strike out affidavits but it ought to be exercised sparingly. To maintain the efficiency of judicial review proceedings, interlocutory contests as to affidavits should be discouraged and be left to be dealt with by the judge hearing the application [see footnote 7].
