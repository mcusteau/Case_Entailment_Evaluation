The applicants submit that the Council does not have the power to suspend Councillors. The
Election Regulations
do not make any provision for the suspension of Councillors. The
Regulations
only contain a provision for the removal of Councillors. The applicants, citing
Martselos v. Salt River First Nation
, 2008 FC 8 in their written memorandum, argue that where the powers of Council are set out in an
Elections Code
, the Council is limited to those powers and it would be incorrect to expand them. In
Martselos
, a Chief of the Salt River First Nation was removed on grounds other than those listed in the
Election Regulations
. Mr. Justice Beaudry held at paragraph 32 that the "
Customary Election Regulations
are an all-encompassing legal code which establish the grounds for which a Chief or Councillor may be removed from office" and that it would be incorrect to expand these grounds.
