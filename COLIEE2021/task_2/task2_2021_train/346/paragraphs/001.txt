Kelen, J.
: The parties in this case are before the court on two separate matters. The first matter (T-440-08) is an application for judicial review of the Sucker Creek First Nation Band Council's decision, dated February 22, 2008, to
suspend
the applicants as elected Councillors pending an investigation into allegations of conflict of interest against the applicants. On April 15, 2008, I granted an interlocutory injunction reinstating the applicants as Councillors pending the outcome of this judicial review application.
