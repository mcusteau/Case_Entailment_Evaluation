No petition was received by the Band Council seeking the removal of the applicants. The Band Council Resolutions removing the applicants were voted on by the three respondents only. The respondents do not explain why section 15.3 of the
Elections Regulations
was not followed except their assertion that the grounds for removal specified in section 15.1 and 15.2 do not require a petition and in any event, the respondents submit that the applicants have an alternate remedy for appealing their removal under s. 15.5 of the
Election Regulations
. Thus, the respondents submit that it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the alleged errors surrounding the removal of the applicants.
