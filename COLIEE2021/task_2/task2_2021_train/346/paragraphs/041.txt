The decision to suspend the applicants was made at a "secret" meeting on February 22, 2008, in an Edmonton hotel. The applicants were not given notice. The applicants were also excluded from a prior meeting regarding their suspensions on February 15, 2008. Additionally, the applicants were never provided with either the letter from Morgan Construction and Environmental Ltd., containing the main conflict of interest allegations against the applicants, or the memorandum from ATCO Electric Ltd. alleging problems with rates for pay for contractors involving the applicants. Thus, the applicants did not have an opportunity to respond to these allegations or to be present at the meeting where the decision to suspend them was taken.
