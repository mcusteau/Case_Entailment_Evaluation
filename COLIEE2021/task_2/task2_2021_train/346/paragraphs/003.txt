In this case, the Court concludes that the first application to set aside the decision suspending the applicants must be allowed because the indefinite suspension of the two councillors was effectively a removal, and the Council did not follow the election rules to remove the applicants. Moreover, the Council Meeting suspending the two councillors lacked fairness in that the applicants were not given notice of the allegations against them or an opportunity to respond. The second application to set aside the Band Council resolutions removing the two councillors is also allowed. The clear election regulations (referred to below) were not followed in that there was no prerequisite petition from the electors seeking the removal of the two councillors before the Council removed them.
