The applicant has argued that the Council acted beyond its powers in suspending the applicants. Mr. Justice Beaudry held in
Martselos v. Salt River Nation #195
, [2008] F.T.R. Uned. 15; 2008 FC 8, at paragraphs 16-18 that on questions of whether the Council acted beyond its powers, the appropriate standard of review is correctness (see also
Vollant v. Sioui et al.
(2006), 295 F.T.R. 48; 2006 FC 487, per Justice de Montigny at paragraph 31). The respondents have argued that the Council has the authority to suspend by custom. The Federal Court of Appeal noted, in its decision upholding Mr. Justice Beaudry's holding in
Martselos
, that "the Council has a greater expertise on matters such as knowledge of the Band's customs." (See also
Giroux v. Swan River First Nation et al.
(2006), 288 F.T.R. 55; 2006 FC 285,, per Justice Dawson at paragraph 54, varied on other grounds in (2007), 361 N.R. 360; 2007 FCA 108 (

)).
