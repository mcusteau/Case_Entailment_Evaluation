[47]
It is clear to the Court that the procedures for removing elected Councillors in the
Election Regulations
were not followed. Thus, the removal is not valid under the
Election Regulations
for the following two reasons:
a. the
Election Regulations
clearly and expressly provide that the Council can only remove the Chief or a Councillor upon receipt of a petition signed by at least 50% plus one of the electors stating the grounds under section 15.1 or 15.2 for seeking the removal before the Council can convene a special meeting to consider the removal. In this case there was no such petition; and
b. the meeting where the applicants were allegedly removed, was not a meeting convened by the Council. In fact, four of the seven members of Council did not agree to that meeting at that date. When the previous meeting had adjourned it was agreed that the next meeting would be at a time and place agreed upon. Instead this meeting was set unilaterally by the respondents.
