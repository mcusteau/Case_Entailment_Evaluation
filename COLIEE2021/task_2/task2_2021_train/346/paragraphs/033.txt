I am satisfied, as was Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer in
Lafond v. Muskeg Lake Cree Nation et al.
(2008), 330 F.T.R. 60; 2008 FC 726, at paragraphs 10 to 12, that the Chief and Council retain customary powers and authority, where Band legislation has not "covered the field", to suspend and discipline councillors. However, like Madam Justice Tremblay-Lamer in that case, I am satisfied that the applicants "suspension" from office was in fact a "removal" from their elected position. Justice Tremblay-Lamer said at paragraph 12:
"Nevertheless, I am of the view that while couched as a suspension from office, and thus qualitatively different from a removal, what has actually occurred in the present case is a removal of the applicant from his elected position."
ii. Was the meeting a "Duly Convened Meeting" of Council?
