The applicant was informed by letter dated 15 January 1998 of the Board's decision, which had been rendered on 1 October 1997 (AR, tab 2). The decision affirmed the Entitlement Appeal Panel's decision of 27 March 1997. In its decision, the Board held,
"The Board has carefully reviewed all of the available evidence in this case and has concluded, in the absence of a Report on Injuries to document the incident which allegedly took place in 1963, and confirming whether or not the appellant was on duty at that time, that the condition of lumbar disc disease is not related to the exigencies of peace time service. Furthermore, service records are devoid of any complaints regarding the appellant's back. The first medical evidence regarding back problems appears in a report dated 22 March 1993 from D.J. O'Neil, M.D., indicating a long history of low back pain, this published some 29 years after the appellant was released from service.
"It is further noted that the appellant injured his back in 1971, 1972 and 1990, again several years in the post-discharge period, and while the appellant maintains that his back problems pre-dated his 1971 injury, that is, his back problems arose from the alleged incident at the Bedford Rifle Range in 1963, without any recorded in-service evidence the Board is unable to grant pension entitlement. Moreover, the Board was not presented with any new medical evidence that would lead it to the conclusion that the appellant's present day had its onset during peace time service."
