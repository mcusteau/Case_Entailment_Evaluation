The applicant, Anthony Douglas MacDonald, was born in 1946. He enlisted with the Canadian Armed Forces and served in the Militia from 26 July 1963 until 27 January 1964, and in the Regular Forces from 4 August 1967 until 11 August 1967. In September 1963, the applicant claims he was riding in the back of a truck with other members of his unit, in the course of their duties, when the truck had an accident. The applicant claims he was injured, received treatment on site in a mobile hospital unit, and returned to his duties shortly thereafter. The accident and injury, however, are not recorded in the applicant's service medical records (application record ("AR"), tab 6, affidavit of Bunty Albert, exhibit A).
