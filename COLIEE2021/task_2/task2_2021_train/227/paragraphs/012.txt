In further assistance to applicants, the
Pension Act
creates favourable presumptions; the relevant one for the purposes of the case at bar is contained in s. 21(3):
"21(3) For the purposes of subs. (2), an injury or disease, or the aggravation of an injury or disease, shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, to have arisen out of or to have been directly connected with military service of the kind described in that subsection if the injury or disease or the aggravation thereof was incurred in the course of
. . . . .
(f) any military operation, training or administration, either as a result of a specific order or established military custom or practice, whether or not failure to perform the act that resulted in the disease or injury or aggravation thereof would have resulted in disciplinary action against the member."
Thus, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, causation is presumed if the injury was incurred during the course of the applicant's service.
