  There are, however, some issues raised by Apotex in its counterclaim that were not pursued at trial. I do not feel these deserve any award of costs. The first of these issues was an alleged conspiracy related to the conflict proceedings before the Commissioner of Patents; this claim was abandoned prior to trial but only after extensive discovery and corresponding motions. The second alleged conspiracy related to a licence agreement between Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. and Ratiopharm Inc. According to Apotex, this agreement violated the Competition Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34. This counterclaim was stayed in view of similar proceedings in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. Third, Apotex abandoned claims pursuant to the Trade-marks Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.-T-13. In the circumstances of this action, no costs should be awarded to Apotex for these issues that were raised in the pleadings but did not proceed to trial. I acknowledge that some costs were awarded against Apotex in respect of at least certain of these issues (see, the Order of Justice Hughes, dated September 12, 2007, and the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in Apotex Inc. v. Sanofi-Aventis, 2008 FCA 175, 66 C.P.R. (4th) 6). Nevertheless, given the nature of these issues and the degree to which they caused extra work, I believe that it would be fair to exclude the costs related to those issues from the overall award. Rather than require the parties to enter into the quagmire of (first) questioning whether specific costs related to those issues, and (second) taking into account the award of costs by Justice Hughes and the Court of Appeal, in my discretion, I will consider a discount of 10% to account for these issues.
