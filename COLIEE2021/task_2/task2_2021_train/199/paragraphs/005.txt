  The starting point is that a successful party is entitled to have its costs assessed on the basis of Tariff B at the mid-point of Column III (as provided for in Rule 407), together with disbursements that are reasonable and necessary for the conduct of the proceedings. This would be the basis of assessment unless the judge provides directions to the assessment officer or takes on the responsibility of assessing the costs. In this case, the parties are not seeking that I establish the amount of costs; rather, the parties, in a very principled way, have provided me with their view of various factors affecting the award of costs.
