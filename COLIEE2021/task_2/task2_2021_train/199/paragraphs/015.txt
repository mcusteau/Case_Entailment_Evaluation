  Apotex requests that it be allowed to recover "fees for two first and two second counsel, where applicable, for preparation for and attendance at trial, and preparation and filing of written argument during the course of the trial." Apotex also pointed out that the speed at which this litigation proceeded to trial required the retained law firms to work on more than one issue at a time prior to trial. Further, I observe that the pace of the presentation of evidence at trial would have been next to impossible for one counsel. Every one of the four parties was represented in the courtroom by multiple gowned lawyers. I am prepared to allow Apotex to recover its costs for two first counsel and one second counsel for preparation and attendance at trial and for preparation, filing of and attendance for written argument.
