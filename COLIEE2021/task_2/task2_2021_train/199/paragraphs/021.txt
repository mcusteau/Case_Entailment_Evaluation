  Apotex submits that it made a verbal offer to Sanofi to settle on December 15, 2008. Apotex also made written offers (by e-mail) on January 7, 2009 (less than one week prior to the commencement of the trial), and another on February 16, 2009 (on Day 25 of the trial). While Apotex acknowledges that its offer does not meet the standards of Rule 420, it asks the Court to either double the fees incurred following its January 7, 2009 written offer to settle or to place a 50% premium on such fees.
