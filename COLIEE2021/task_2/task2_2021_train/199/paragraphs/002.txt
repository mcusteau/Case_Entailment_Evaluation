  Although the Reasons cited above dealt with both actions, separate judgments were issued for each Docket. I observe that each of Novopharm Limited (Novopharm) and Apotex Inc. (Apotex) have materially different interests on the issue of costs. Accordingly, I have determined that a separate decision will issue for Docket: T-1161-07.
