  In my view, the upper end of Column IV is appropriate, and not simply because this award "splits the difference". A review of recent jurisprudence on the issue of awards in intellectual property trials indicates that this scale recognizes the significance and complexity of the various issues in such a trial (see, for example, Johnson & Johnson Inc. v. Boston Scientific Ltd., 2008 FC 817, [2008] F.C.J. No. 1022, at para. 15; Adir Costs, above, at para. 9-11; Kirkbi AG v. Ritvik Holdings Inc., 2002 FCT 1109, [2002] F.C.J. No. 1474, at para. 10). This trial, in my view, reflects the same level of significance and complexity. Indeed, in light of the number of Federal Court decisions where the Court concluded, in cases of similar complexity, that the high end of Column IV was appropriate, I question why the parties argued this point. I will award costs based on the upper end of Column IV.
