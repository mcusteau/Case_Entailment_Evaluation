In my view, the proper approach is to be flexible. Clearly the kinds of questions which were aptly criticized in
Can-Air
, supra footnote 5 can easily become abusive. On the other hand, a too rigid adherence to the rules therein laid down is likely to frustrate the very purpose of examination on discovery. While it is not proper to ask a witness what evidence he or she has to support an allegation, it seems to me to be quite a different thing to ask what facts are known to the party being discovered which underlie a particular allegation in the pleadings. While the answer may have a certain element of law in it, it remains in essence a question of fact. Questions of this sort may be essential to a discovery for the purposes of properly defining the issues and avoiding surprise; if the pleadings do not state the facts upon which an allegation is based then the party in whose name that pleading is filed may be required to do so.
