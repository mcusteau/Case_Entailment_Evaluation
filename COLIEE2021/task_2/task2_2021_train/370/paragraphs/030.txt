Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, there are a very small number of interrogatories which were drawn to my attention by counsel at the hearing which do ask questions of pure law and which should therefore be struck out. The following are the examples that were given by counsel:
a) Montana question 21(d): this question clearly asks what legal authority the government had to establish a pay list for Little Bear's Band.
b) Samson question 125: here again the question asks for the legal authority under the
Indian Act
for making certain per capita payments.
c) Ermineskin question 17: while the introductory part of this question is limited to facts and is unexceptionable, the follow-up questions contained in paragraphs (a) and following all seek admissions of law from the Crown and are improper.
