On the other hand, many experienced trial judges take a broader view. Thus in
Rubinoff v. Newton
[see footnote 6] Haines, J., said:
"The line of demarcation between disclosure of facts on which a party relies and the evidence in support of the fact may at times be very fine, and when it occurs, the resolution must be fact disclosure. And I can think of no more a simple and direct question than, 'On what facts do you rely?'
"(...) The opposite party is entitled to know the facts on which the acts of negligence or recovery are alleged but not the evidence to support it. To deny such facts would be to refuse the very purpose of discovery which is to learn the facts, or often equally more important, the absence of facts, pertaining to each and every allegation in the pleadings."
