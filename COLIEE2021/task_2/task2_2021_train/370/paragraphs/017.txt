Finally in
Cardinal et al. v. Canada
[see footnote 4] Mr. Prothonotary Hargrave, following the earlier jurisprudence, held that questions regarding the circumstances surrounding a surrender poll and the execution of surrender documents could properly be put and should be answered. This aspect of his decision was left undisturbed both on appeal to this division and on further appeal to the Court of Appeal.
