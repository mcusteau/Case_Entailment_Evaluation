As earlier stated, there is no dispute that the law requires that questions that fall into these categories should not be answered. However counsel have made very few submissions under these categories and in most of them I find the objection to be without foundation. Thus, questions relating to government policy with respect to the establishment and surrender of reserve lands are clearly relevant insofar as they relate to the reserve lands here in question; to the extent that a question may appear over-broad the answer may be limited to the matters actually in issue.
