The Crown's objection on these grounds is based primarily upon two British Columbia cases [see footnote 1]. In those cases it was held that it is not appropriate at discovery to ask deponents historical facts of which neither they nor any living persons to whom they have access have any memory and which can only be ascertained by reliance upon documentary records. Since the answers will of necessity be based on a reading of the documents, such questions should only be answered by expert historians as a matter of opinion.
