The jurisprudence is divided as to "compendious" or "reliance" questions; in
Can-Air Services Ltd. v. British Aviation Insurance Co.
[see footnote 5], it was said to be improper to ask a witness what evidence he had in support of an allegation or how it was to be proved at trial. Such reliance questions do not ask for facts that the witness knows or can learn but rather require the witness to play the part of a lawyer and to select which facts can be relied on to prove a given allegation.
