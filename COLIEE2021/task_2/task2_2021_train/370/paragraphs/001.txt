Hugessen, J.
: These actions, which have been joined, deal with matters arising from the adherence of Chief Bobtail and his people to
Treaty 6
in 1877, the creation of reserves as a result thereof, certain alleged surrenders of those reserves, and certain other alleged activities on the part of the Crown and its agents, the descendants of Chief Bobtail and the three plaintiff Bands over a period extending generally through to about 1909, the date of the alleged surrender of the Bobtail reserve. The validity and effects of that surrender are the central issues.
