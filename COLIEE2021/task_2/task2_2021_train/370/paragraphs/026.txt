Likewise in
Brennan v. Poslunds (J.) & Co.
[see footnote 7],
McRuer, C.J., ordered a witness to state the facts relied on in support of an allegation. In his view a question of this sort asks not so much for a conclusion of law by a witness as for the facts behind such conclusion. Where the witness is a party who is asserting that conclusion it is reasonable to ask for the facts supporting it.
