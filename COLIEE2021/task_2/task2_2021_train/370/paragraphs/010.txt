Where these sorts of difficulties arise it is my view that the court, as a part of its policy of encouraging the use of written interrogatories, should attempt to view questions in the best possible light. Thus, for example, where a question is susceptible of two interpretations, one of which is clearly improper (for instance asking the witness to give a conclusion of law), the court should prefer the interpretation which would make the question legitimate and admissible. Deponents, for their part, have a duty to make an honest and open attempt to answer. Thus where a deponent demonstrates an obtuseness in understanding a question or produces an answer which has little or no bearing on the facts in issue, the court will require him or her to answer the question properly in the light of the pleadings and may well attach heavy costs penalties to the party being discovered.
