  In the first place, an applicant has a duty to raise any allegation of bias at the first opportunity, that is, at the hearing before the Board. Mr. Toora's failure to do so implies a waiver on his part and he is foreclosed from raising this allegation in this Court, as Mr. Justice Beaudry held in  
 Wijekoon et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2002] F.T.R. Uned. 508; [2002] F.C.J. No. 1022; 2002 FCT 758, at paragraphs 29-31: 
 
 
 
 "In  
 Re Human Rights Tribunal and Atomic Energy of Canada Limited 
 , [1986] 1 F.C. 103 (F.C.A.), MacGuigan, J., held at page 113: 
 
 
 
 'However, even apart from this express waiver, AECL's whole course of conduct before the Tribunal constituted an implied waiver of any assertion of a reasonable apprehension of bias on the part of the Tribunal. The only reasonable course of conduct for a party reasonably apprehensive of bias would be to allege a violation of natural justice at the earliest practicable opportunity. Here, AECL called witnesses, cross-examined the witnesses called by the Commission, made many submissions to the Tribunal, and took proceedings before both the Trial Division and this Court, all without challenge to the independence of the Commission. In short, it participated fully in the hearing, and must therefore be taken impliedly to have waived its right to object.' 
 
 
 
 "It is trite law that alleged violations of natural justice must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity. If the applicants were in fact concerned that their rights may have been violated, they should have raised their objection at the outset. 
 
 
 
 "This was confirmed again in the case of  
 Kostyshyn v. West Region Tribal Council 
  [1992] F.C.J. No. 731 (QL) (F.C.T.D.) where Muldoon, J., held that the aggrieved party must 'allege promptly' and in the case of  
 Hernandez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1999] F.C.J. No. 607 (QL) (F.C.T.D.), where Pinard, J., made reference to the case of  
 Del Moral v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [1998] F.C.J. No. 782 (QL) (F.C.T.D.). In  
 Del Moral 
 , supra, Dubé, J., concluded that: 
 
 
 
 'The only reasonable course of conduct for a party reasonably apprehensive of bias would be to allege a violation of natural justice at the earliest practicable opportunity.'"
