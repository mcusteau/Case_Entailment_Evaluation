  Similarly, in  
 Jarada v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2005] F.T.R. Uned. 257; [2005] F.C.J. No. 506; 2005 FC 409, at paragraph 22, Mr. Justice de Montigny stated: 
 
 
 
 "It is well-settled case law that the reasons of an administrative tribunal must be taken as a whole in determining whether its decision was reasonable, and analysis does not involve determining whether each point in its reasoning meets the reasonableness test (see in particular  
 Stelco Inc. v. British Steel Canada Inc. 
 , [2000] 3 F.C. 282 (F.C.A.);  
 Yassine v. M.E.I. 
 , [1994] F.C.J. No. 949 (F.C.A.))."
