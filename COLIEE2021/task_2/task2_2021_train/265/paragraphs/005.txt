The first of these decisions is
Westclox Canada Limited v. Pyrotronics of Canada Limited
, [1981] 2 F.C. 68 (F.C.A.). In that case, the applicants had neither obtained leave to appeal nor filed a notice of appeal within the 60 day period set out in s. 48(1)(c) of the
Customs Act
(now subsection 68(1) of the
Customs Act
). The court held that the statute required the applicants to both obtain leave to appeal and to file and serve a notice of appeal within 60 days from the date of the making of the order, finding or declaration. The court also stated that it could not extend the time for obtaining leave to appeal and filing the notice of appeal since the period of time to be extended no longer existed, that is, there was no time period remaining for the court to extend. The court also rejected the submission that rule 2(2) of the
Federal Court Rules
, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663, enabled the court to extend the time and stated that this rule could not operate to enable the court to ignore the clear words of a statutory enactment.
