de Montigny, J.
: This is an application for judicial review of a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) wherein the officer concluded that the applicant was not a person at risk pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27 (the
IRPA
). The PRRA officer concluded that the applicant had an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in Colombo and hence, his claim was rejected. For the reasons that follow, I would allow this application for judicial review.
