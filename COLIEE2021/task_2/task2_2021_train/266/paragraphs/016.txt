It is to be noted that the only witness before the Board was Sanchez himself, no other witnesses gave evidence. The Minister put in evidence certain newspaper clippings and materials from sources such as U.S. Department of State reports. This sort of "evidence" appears to be accepted routinely in matters of this kind but is not the best evidence as to what an individual may or may not have done. Cumulatively the evidence may or may not meet the "less than balance of probabilities" test, but its probity, on an individual basis such as that of Sanchez, is less than satisfactory. When applying facts individually to a person in Sanchez's position, weight must be given to direct evidence, and less weight to generalized, otherwise unsupported statements, even if from an apparently reliable source.
