Having reviewed the factual findings of the Board, the findings as to "Nature of the Organization" and "Knowledge of the Organization's Atrocities" were patently unreasonable. Such factual findings were critical to the Board's finding, in law, that Sanchez "committed" atrocities. The application will therefore be allowed, the decision of the Board will be quashed and the matter sent back for a new hearing before a differently constituted Board. There is no question requiring certification. There will be no order as to costs.
