 [19] 
  As in  
 Malik 
 , above, I find that the duty of fairness owed to the applicant in this case was low and, in any event, was met through the prior notice provided to her specifying clearly the process that would be followed and the documentation required in order to support the application (see  
 Malik 
 , above, at para 29). In this case, the applicant did not raise the fact that through the issuance of instructions the visa officer had fettered his discretion. She was wise not to do so given that this argument was rejected in  
 Malik 
 , above, and that it is clearly evident from the information on the website, to which the applicant was directed, that if it was impossible for her to obtain the kind of detailed letters required from her employers, she should give an explanation in that respect and attempt to file different objective evidence, such as copies of past work assessments, etc.
