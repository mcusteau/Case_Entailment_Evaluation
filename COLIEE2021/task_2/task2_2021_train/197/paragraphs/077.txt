  I am not convinced by Mövenpick's argument. This Court is now invited to step into the Registrar's shoes, and the rules of evidence must therefore reflect those to which the Trade-marks Opposition Board must adhere. To borrow the words of Mr. Justice Décary in  
 Austin Nichols & Co v Cinnabon Inc 
 , [1998] 4 FC 569, [1998] FCJ No 1352 (QL): 
 
 
 
 13 The role of the court sitting in appeal of a decision of the Registrar is made abundantly clear by the last words of subsection 56(5). In giving the Court the same discretion as that "vested in the Registrar", Parliament has recognized that the Court sitting in appeal is expected to be able to decide the issues as if they were tried for the first time before the Court. This, in my view, suggests that a registered owner has in appeal the same opportunity to file evidence he had before the Registrar.
