  There is no precise template to be followed in applying for registration of a trade-mark. The applicant has considerable literary freedom. Esso, like Irving, could have chosen to define convenience store services as including fast-food services. It did not and was not taken to task by the Registrar, who has a wealth of experience. I see no reason why I should act any differently.
