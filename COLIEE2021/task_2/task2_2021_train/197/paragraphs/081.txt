  Section 56(5) of the  
 Trade-marks Act 
 , which allows parties to adduce new evidence, provides that the Federal Court may exercise any discretion vested in the Registrar. Thus, if it is necessary to consider the Levins affidavit on this point at all, in my discretion I accept it and am satisfied that Esso has used "March√© Express" in association with "convenience store and fast-food services offered at gasoline stations."
