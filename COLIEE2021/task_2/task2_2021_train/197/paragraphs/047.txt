  The evidence before her established that the "Marché Express" convenience stores at gasoline stations sold a variety of items such as cigarettes, candy bars and salty snacks, and offered fast-food items such as sandwiches, donuts, coffee and soft drinks. She thought it unlikely that the parties' trades would overlap because "as I understand it, the Applicant's services are not fast-food restaurant services, but rather convenience stores at gasoline stations where limited food items are sold." However, Mövenpick's statement of service did not include any limitation and nothing would prevent it from operating fast-food restaurants at gasoline stations. In such case, there could be a potential overlap between Esso's fast-food services and Mövenpick's restaurant services.
