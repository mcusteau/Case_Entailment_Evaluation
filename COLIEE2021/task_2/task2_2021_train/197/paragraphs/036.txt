 [36] 
  Before the Registrar, Mövenpick argued that "Marché Express" is confusing within the meaning of both sections 12 and 16 of the Act. It is confusing within the meaning of section 12(1)(d) with a registered trade-mark, and confusing within section 16(1)(a) and (c) as with marks previously used in Canada by Mövenpick, and confusing with a trade-name that had been previously used in Canada. However, the section 16 grounds were not seriously pursued in this appeal, and lack an evidentiary basis in any event.
