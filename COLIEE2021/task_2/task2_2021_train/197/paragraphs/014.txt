  As different issues relate to different dates, I consider a basic timeline to be helpful: 
 
 
 
 a. May 1992: the opening of the first Mövenpick "Marché" restaurant in Toronto; 
 
 
 
 b. 1 December 1994: filing date for registration of the "Marché" trade-mark; the services offered being the operation of restaurants; 
 
 
 
 c. 12 July 1996: registration date of "Marché"; 
 
 
 
 d. 18 July 2001: the opening of the first "Marché Express" in St-Hubert, a Montréal suburb; 
 
 
 
 e. 4 December 2001: Esso filed its application to register "Marché Express" word and design, based on use in Canada since 19 July 2001; 
 
 
 
 f. 17 September 2003: advertisement of the application for opposition purposes in the  
 Trade-mark Journal 
 , with the right to the exclusive use of the words "Marché" and "Express" disclaimed separately apart from the trade-mark; 
 
 
 
 g. 16 November 2004: Mövenpick filed a statement of opposition; and 
 
 
 
 h. 3 August 2010: the Registrar's decision dismissing the opposition.
