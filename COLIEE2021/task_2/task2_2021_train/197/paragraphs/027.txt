  In my view, this new evidence merely shores up the Registrar's decision. She accepted that the word "marché" was used by other traders to describe convenience stores. However the mark applied for was not solely the word "marché" but the combined words "Marché Express", which is not a linguistic construction which flows naturally in the French language. She was of the view that these combined words did not have a precise meaning with respect to the character of convenience store services. She concluded that the mark was merely suggestive of the result liable to be produced as opposed to being intrinsically linked to the services themselves.
