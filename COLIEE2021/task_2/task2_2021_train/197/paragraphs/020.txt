  The Registrar was of the view that the proposed mark could not be said to be clearly descriptive in the English language of convenience stores. Mövenpick focused more on French definitions. One of the definitions of "marché" in  
 Le Petit Robert 
  was "[l]ieu public de vente de biens et de services", while "express" was defined as "qui assure un déplacement ou un service rapide." The evidence before her established that the word "marché" was used by many other traders to describe "convenience stores" but that the combined words did not have a precise meaning with respect to the character of convenience store services. There was no evidence of use of "Marché Express" by other traders in the marketplace. She was of the view that at most the mark suggested ease of purchasing items at a convenience store which could save consumers some time. She concluded that the mark was not clearly descriptive in either in the French or English language.
