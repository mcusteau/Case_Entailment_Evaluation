  The Applicant made his second application for disability benefits on January 27, 2004. The application was deemed to have been made on March 18, 2003, the "protected date", since this is the date the Applicant's M.P. had first made an inquiry on behalf of the Applicant. In this second application, the Applicant submitted that he was working one to three days per week for one to three hours per day as an insurance salesman and that his ongoing chronic conditions prevented him from working more.
