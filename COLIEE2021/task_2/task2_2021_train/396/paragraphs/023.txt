As stated earlier, I do not wish my conclusion on the facts of this matter to be interpreted as a finding that it would be impossible to found a danger opinion on a single serious conviction, where there is evidence on file supporting the view that a person so convicted poses a present or future danger to persons in Canada. However, there is nothing in the circumstances of this case preceding or surrounding the single conviction, or subsequent to the single conviction, to indicate that the applicant constitutes a present or future danger to the public. There is no question that by virtue of the very serious crime he committed, the applicant was quite properly subject to deportation; however, being found to constitute a danger to the public in Canada, combined with the conviction, has further implications; it removes a right of appeal to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board. For this to follow, in addition to the conviction, there must be evidence of present or future danger.
