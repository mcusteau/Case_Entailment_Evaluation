[10]
No argument was presented regarding the sufficiency of procedural safeguards taken in the formation of the opinion, nor were any constitutional arguments regarding the validity of s. 70(5) presented at the hearing. In the applicant's supplementary memorandum of argument, counsel for the applicant raised a constitutional issue regarding the standards against which a legislative provision should be measured for a determination as to vagueness. Since my invitation to make further submissions was with regard to the two issues noted above, and since there was no notice of a constitutional question that I am aware of, nor opportunity for counsel for the respondent to orally address this issue, I will not deal with it.
