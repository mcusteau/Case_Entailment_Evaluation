Counsel submitted that the scheme of the
Act
itself gives support for the position that a conviction alone is not sufficient to ground a danger opinion, since there are two requirements under the subsection that must be met for an appeal right to be removed: the individual must have been convicted of a serious offence
and
must be found to be a danger to the public. There is in place, mandatory removal of landed persons who have been convicted of serious offences, but such persons have a right to appeal the deportation order before removal. Section 70(5) removes that right to appeal for only certain of those persons, those who are the subject of danger opinions. If Parliament intended that a conviction for a serious offence alone grounded a danger opinion, then there would be no need for a determination of opinion by the respondent. Counsel argued that to give meaning to both requirements, the danger opinion must be founded on something more than a conviction alone.
