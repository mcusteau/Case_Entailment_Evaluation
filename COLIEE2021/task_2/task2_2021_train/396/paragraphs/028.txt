I am cognizant that in order to be certified, a question must be one that not only transcends the interests of the immediate parties and contemplates issues of general importance, but it must also be a question that is determinative of the appeal. (
Liyanagamage v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1994), 176 N.R. 4 (F.C.A.), per DÃ©cary, J.A.)
On this basis, I find that the questions proposed by counsel for the applicant should not be certified. However, I disagree with the position of counsel for the respondent that no question ought to be certified. Because it is determinative of this matter, and because, in my view, it is a serious question of general importance, I will certify the following question:
"Does the phrase 'danger to the public in Canada', as it appears in s. 70(5) of the
Immigration Act
, imply a concept of 'present or future danger' that must be satisfied?"
Application allowed.
