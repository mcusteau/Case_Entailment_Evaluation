[7]
Pursuant to s. 70(1) of the
Act
, a permanent resident has a right to appeal the issuance of a deportation order to the Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board; the filing of an appeal of this nature stays the execution of the deportation order pending determination of the appeal. Section 70(5) was enacted by s. 13(3) of
An Act to amend the Immigration Act and the Citizenship Act and to make a consequential amendment to the Customs Act
(S.C. 1995, c. 15, in force 10 July 1995), and provides:
"(5) No appeal may be made to the Appeal Division by a person described in subs. (1) or paragraph (2)(a) or (b) against whom a deportation order or conditional deportation order is made where the Minister is of the opinion that the person constitutes a danger to the public in Canada and the person has been determined by an adjudicator to be
(a) a member of an inadmissible class described in paragraph 19(1)(c), (c.1), (c.2) or (d);
(b) a person described in paragraph 27(1)(a.1); or
(c) a person described in paragraph 27(1)(d) who has been convicted of an offence under any Act of Parliament for which a term of imprisonment of ten years or more may be imposed."
The "danger opinion" provided for in s. 70(5) functions in a similar way to similar opinions provided for in other provisions of the
Act
which mandate certain consequences of the Minister forming the opinion that a person constitutes a danger to the public in Canada. Section 70(5) removes the right to appeal a deportation order to the Appeal Division where there is a "danger opinion" and the person is determined to be criminally inadmissible to Canada.
