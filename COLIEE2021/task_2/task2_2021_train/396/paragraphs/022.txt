Against the foregoing, I find that the respondent erred in law, in making a determination that the applicant constituted a danger to the public in Canada. I am satisfied, that on the material that was before the respondent, there was no evidence that the applicant posed a "present or future danger" to the public in Canada. The evidence disclosed that the applicant was not a paedophile; he demonstrated low sexual arousal in all areas based on testing conducted well after the events that led to his conviction. The applicant's conviction occurred nearly four years before the danger opinion, and there was no evidence of criminal activity in the interim. Throughout his dealings with police and probation officers, and with Immigration officials, the applicant was cooperative. I cannot see any basis for the issuance of the danger opinion beyond the fact of the single serious conviction and the relatively singular series of events leading to that conviction.
