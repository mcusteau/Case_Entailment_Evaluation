  I stated earlier that Bell's first response to Ms. Lusina's complaint provided its detailed position with respect to the merits of the complaint. At the outset, however, it raised the issue of the agreement. When the investigator summarized Bell's position and provided it to Ms. Lusina for her commentary, the summary made no reference to this "defence". Hence, Ms. Lusina, not being aware that Bell had raised it, as an issue, did not respond to it. After Ms. Lusina submitted her commentary, there was a change of investigators.
