  On December 6th, Ms. Lusina accepted Bell's offer subject to clarification on a number of points (none of which are relevant to this matter). It appears that, while dealing directly with Bell, she continued to consult counsel. On December 19th, Ms. Lusina signed her human rights complaint. On December 21st, she and Bell arrived at a settlement, the terms of which were incorporated into an "Acknowledgement, Release and Discharge" (the agreement), subject to final approval by Human Resources (Bell) and Ms. Lusina obtaining legal advice (Bell agreed to pay her legal fees). It seems that counsel who provided legal advice in relation to the agreement was not the same counsel retained by Ms. Lusina in May.
