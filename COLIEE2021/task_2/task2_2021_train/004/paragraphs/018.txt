  Regarding the allegation of false evidence, Ms. Lusina contends that the CHRC was influenced by false information provided by Bell. Bell's representative - who had carriage of the file - falsely stated that she was not aware of the human rights complaint until January 25th, a full week after Bell executed the agreement. Ms. Lusina maintains that the individual knew about the complaint on January 18th, the day the agreement was signed by Bell. The failure of the CHRC to investigate further is, according to Ms. Lusina, a breach of the duty of fairness.
