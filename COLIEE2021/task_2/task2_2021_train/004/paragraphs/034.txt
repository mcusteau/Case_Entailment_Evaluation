  There are a number of similarities between  
 Gee 
  and the case before me. Notably, the CHRC, here, had before it the investigator's report as well as the submissions of the parties in respect of the contents of that report, which they had the opportunity to review before it was submitted to the CHRC. In  
 Gee 
 , there were also other related documents arising out of the long history of the situation. There is, in my view, however, a striking and material distinction between  
 Gee 
  and this matter. In  
 Gee 
 , there is no indication that there was an allegation of, or an argument relating to, a breach of procedural fairness. That is not the situation here.
