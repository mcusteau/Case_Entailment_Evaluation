  Bell submitted its response in correspondence dated September 18, 2002. At the outset, Bell referred to the settlement discussions, the resolution, and the agreement. It specifically noted that, at the time the release was signed, Ms. Lusina failed "to inform Bell that she had filed a human rights complaint and purposely withheld information that was clearly material to severance negotiations". Bell then provided an overview of its past history in relation to separation programs and addressed (with the exception of Ms. Lusina's performance of her duties) the matters particularized by the CHRC. On October 30th, the investigator provided a summary of Bell's responsive submissions to Ms. Lusina. The summary, however, did not mention Bell's allegation that Ms. Lusina had purposely withheld information regarding the filing of the complaint during the settlement negotiations and at the time the release was signed.
