  There was a clear violation of the duty of fairness, in Ms. Lusina's view, when the CHRC withheld pertinent information regarding Bell's defence, namely, Bell's allegation that her complaint was vexatious or frivolous or in bad faith in the face of the settlement agreement. She was not aware of Bell's position in this respect until she received the investigator's report in July, 2003. Consequently, she contends that she did not have an opportunity to respond to it before the investigator made a recommendation to the CHRC.
