  Ms. Lusina asserts that this is a case warranting the court's intervention. She says that the CHRC has a statutory obligation to deal with a complaint, that it should dismiss only in plain and obvious cases, and that it can dismiss where it finds bad faith, but there is no bad faith here. In general terms, she argues that the CHRC violated procedural fairness, failed to conduct a thorough investigation of her complaint before deciding to dismiss it, and was influenced by false evidence or by misapprehension of the complaint.
