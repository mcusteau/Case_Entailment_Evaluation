  With these principles in mind, I turn to the circumstances of this matter. The decision of the CHRC tracks the wording contained in the investigator's recommendation to dismiss: "the complainant has signed a settlement release covering the events alleged in the complaint". In  
 Gee 
 , supra, the Federal Court of Appeal dealt with a situation where judicial review had been granted in circumstances not unlike those that exist here. The CHRC had dismissed a complaint "in view of the agreement reached between the parties". The applications judge characterized the agreement as "contracting out" of the protection of the  
 CHRA 
 , a matter which is prohibited by general principles of law. On appeal, Mr. Justice Strayer, writing for a unanimous court, underscored the importance of the totality of the material before the CHRC and the result reached. He concluded that the CHRC (in  
 Gee 
 ) had before it considerable background material that could explain its decision, of which the agreement was, in reality, only one element.
