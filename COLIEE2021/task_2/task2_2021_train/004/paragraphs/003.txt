  Ms. Lusina retained counsel in relation to the termination of her employment. In May of 2001, negotiations regarding an acceptable severance package began. Ms. Lusina's counsel suggested that 18 - 24 months salary, in lieu of notice, was reasonable. On August 11, 2001, Ms. Lusina wrote to the CHRC alleging discriminatory conduct by Bell. She informed her lawyer that she had done so. On October 19th, she requested that Bell deal directly with her rather than through her counsel. The negotiations continued. On November 26th, Bell presented a "final" offer. On November 29th, Ms. Lusina contacted the CHRC about amending her complaint. She spoke with CHRC counsel, CÃ©line Harrington, and in the course of their discussion regarding potential amendments to her complaint, Ms. Lusina informed Ms. Harrington about the settlement offer and inquired as to whether it could affect her human rights complaint. Ms. Harrington advised that, normally, releases are attached to such packages and Bell would "likely object based on that release". Ms. Harrington also stated that while it is generally the view that one cannot sign away human rights, she could not guarantee that the settlement would not have an impact.
