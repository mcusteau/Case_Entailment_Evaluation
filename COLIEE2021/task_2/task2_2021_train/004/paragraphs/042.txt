  The situation is further compounded by Bell's misrepresentation - regarding the date it received notice of the complaint - in its response to the investigator's report. That representation was supported by a document which, on the record before me, appears to be a doctored one. While Bell argues that its representation is irrelevant to the issue - Ms. Lusina's disclosure of the human rights complaint to Bell - it seems to me that it is relevant to the extent that it undermined the position taken by Ms. Lusina in her response to the investigator's report. Ms. Lusina took the position that Bell was aware of the complaint prior to executing the agreement. Bell's responses to the complaint (before completion of the investigator's report) allege prejudice arising from non disclosure of the complaint, both with respect to the negotiations and, to a lesser extent, to finalizing the agreement. Bell's representation to the CHRC in this respect left Ms. Lusina powerless because she did not know of Bell's position, nor could she have known. She learned of it only as a result of her preparation for determining whether she would seek judicial review of the impugned decision.
