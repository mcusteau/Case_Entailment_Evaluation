In the present case, with respect to the CRDD's main credibility concern quoted above at paragraph 8, the CRDD made the following finding:
"The claimant did not provide a satisfactory explanation for the fact that she did not try to leave Saint Vincent at an earlier date, considering that the alleged abuse went on from 1971 to 1992, a period of 21 years. She had obtained a passport in 1987. The reasons she gave for not leaving the country at an earlier date were that her children were small and later that she was waiting for an opportunity to come to Canada. She came when she received a letter inviting her to visit a friend in Canada. The panel is not persuaded that she could not have left at an earlier date, with the help of her parents who continued to assist her and who looked after her children. She could have sought refuge in other Caribbean countries, which were easier to reach and did not require visas (footnote omitted)." [see footnote 18]
The CRDD then goes on to state:
"A major delay occurred in Canada, where she waited more than five years to make her claim. Furthermore, she made a claim only after her application to stay on humanitarian and compassionate grounds was rejected. She testified that she remained illegally in Canada and that she did not inquire about regularising her position for a long time. Information about the possibility to claim refugee status is easily available to an English speaking person in Toronto and can be obtained from many sources. The panel finds that her behaviour contradicts the well-founded fear of persecution she claims. Her testimony that she did not move from the address where she resided even after she was informed that her husband was making attempts to have her deported from Canada as an illegal immigrant confirms the above finding of the panel."
