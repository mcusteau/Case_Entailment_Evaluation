The story the applicant has to tell about her abuse and the action she took, or did not take as a result, is only part of what is required to substantiate her refugee claim; the other part is the knowledge, understanding, and sensitivity that the CRDD must possess in order to properly assess the applicant's story. That is, the answer to the question of whether a potential option is an IFA for the applicant must include a very careful and informed analysis of whether it is reasonable from the applicant's perspective, given the state of her mind and the condition of her existence resulting from the abuse. The claimant is the only one who can tell the story; knowing how to decide whether to believe her is critical.
