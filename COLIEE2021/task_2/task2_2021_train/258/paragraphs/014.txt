[14]
During the course of the oral hearing before me, counsel for the respondent submitted that the questions respecting the applicant's credibility did not affect the outcome of the CRDD hearing since the ultimate decision reached was that the applicant had an available internal flight alternative ("IFA") which she did not use. I rejected this argument from the bench because a finding that an IFA is viable, attainable, and accessible [see footnote 11] depends on a full understanding of the applicant's condition, which requires a proper assessment of the applicant's credibility.
