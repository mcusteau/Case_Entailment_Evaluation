[29]
Accordingly, for the reasons provided concerning the reviewable error arising from the CRDD's representation respecting credibility, I hereby set aside the CRDD's decision, and refer the applicant's claim back to a differently constituted panel for redetermination in accordance with the following direction: As I am satisfied that it would be an ordeal to require the applicant to give her evidence again, on the redetermination the transcript of the applicant's evidence taken in the first hearing be accepted as evidence without the need for the applicant to again testify orally, except for questions or further evidence that might be required to be presented by the applicant, the hearing officer, or members of the panel.
