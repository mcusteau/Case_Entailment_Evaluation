[3]
In the plaintiff's return for the taxation year 1980, the plaintiff did not report the disposition of her former property nor the acquisition of the replacement property. As a consequence, the Crown concluded that there had been a disposition of capital property, i.e., that property transferred by the plaintiff to Linda Armson. The Crown fixed the deemed proceeds of disposition of that property at $50,000, deducted the adjusted cost base of $11,500, calculated the total capital gain at $38,500 and then fixed the taxable capital gain tax at $19,250.
