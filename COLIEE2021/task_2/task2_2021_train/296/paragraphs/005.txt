(a) property the proceeds of disposition of which are described in subparagraph 13(21)(d)(ii), (iii) or (iv) or 54(h)(ii), (iii) or (iv), or
(b) a property that was, immediately before the disposition, a former business property of the taxpayer,

(e) the gain for a particular taxation year from the disposition of his former property shall be deemed to be the amount, if any, by which
(i) where the particular year is the initial year, the lesser of
(A) the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition of the former property exceed the aggregate of its adjusted cost base to him immediately before the disposition and any outlays and expenses to the extent that they were made or incurred by him for the purpose of making the disposition, and
(B) the amount, if any, by which the proceeds of disposition of the former property exceed the aggregate of the cost to him, or in the case of depreciable property, the capital cost to him, determined without reference to paragraph (f), of his replacement property and any outlays and expenses to the extent that they were made or incurred by him for the purpose of making the disposition, or
(ii) where the particular year is subsequent to the initial year, the amount, if any, claimed by him under subparagraph (iii) in computing his gain for the immediately preceding year from the disposition of the former property,
exceeds
(iii) such amount as he may claim, not exceeding a reasonable amount, as a reserve in respect of such of the proceeds of disposition of the former property that are not due to him until after the end of the particular year as may reasonably be regarded as a portion of the amount determined under subparagraph (i) in respect of the property, and
(f) the cost to him or, in the case of depreciable property, the capital cost to him of his replacement property at any time after the time he disposed of his former property, shall be deemed to be
(i) the cost to him or, in the case of depreciable property, the capital cost to him of his replacement property otherwise determined,
minus
(ii) the amount, if any, by which the amount determined under clause (e)(i)(A) exceeds the amount determined under clause (e)(i)(B).

(a) if he has elected in respect thereof under subs. (1), he shall be deemed to have elected in respect thereof under subs. 13(4); and
(b) if he has elected in respect thereof under subs. 13(4), he shall be deemed to have elected in respect thereof under subs. (1).

shall, to the extent that the taxpayer so elects in his return of income under this Part for the year in which he acquired the replacement property, be deemed not to be proceeds of disposition of that part and to be proceeds of disposition of the other part.
"4(7) Subparagraph (1)(e)(iii) does not apply to permit a taxpayer to claim any amount thereunder in computing a gain for a taxation year where
(a) the taxpayer, at the end of the year or at any time in the immediately following year, was not resident in Canada or was exempt from tax under any provision of this Part; or
