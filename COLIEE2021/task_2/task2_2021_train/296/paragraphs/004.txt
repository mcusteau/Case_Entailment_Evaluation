It is well-known that since the major revisions to Canadian income tax law came into effect by the adoption of the
Income Tax Law Amendment
Act
in 1971, gains on the disposition of capital property are taxable. The
Act
, however, provides for temporary relief to a taxpayer when, upon the disposition of such property, he acquires capital property as replacement property. Pursuant to s. 44, the taxpayer may elect to offset the gain in one with the price of the other and postpone the eventual reckoning of any capital gain to a subsequent or ultimate disposition.
