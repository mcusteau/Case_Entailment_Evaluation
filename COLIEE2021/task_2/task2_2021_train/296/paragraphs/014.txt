Whatever the practical application of s. 44 in the eyes of the individual taxpayer, there is no doubt in my mind that the requirement for an election is clearly set forth and must be respected. One of the essential requirements of an election, if the dictum in
Cooksley v. Toomaten Oota
, 5 C.C.C. 26, is to be respected is that in all events an election must be communicated. The particular method of communication might vary from case to case and indeed there is implied in the language of s. 44 various methods of communicating an election. Nevertheless, absent an election, I do not see where the normal tax rules relating to the disposition of any capital asset can be avoided.
