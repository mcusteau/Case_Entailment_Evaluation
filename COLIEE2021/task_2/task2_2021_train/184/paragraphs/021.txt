  The respondents allege the applicants mischaracterize the significance and impact of the CIRB decision. The CIRB was tasked with determining whether certain individuals fell within the definition of  
 "employee" per the  
 Code 
 . A determination that an individual is an employee within the meaning of the  
 Code 
  does not by implication mean the individual is an employee for the purposes of other legislation. In  
 Estwick 
 , Justice Heneghan dismissed an application for judicial review against an adjudicator's decision, who found that the applicants were not public service employees. She found that the work "employee" can have a "different meaning on different legislative schemes" (para. 26).  
 Pointe-Claire 
  is of limited applicability to the case at bar, as it deals specifically with the collective bargaining setting. Further, the respondent states the CIRB's decision does not make the impugned decision res judicata as the CIRB decision was limited in scope and did not consider the pension status of the individual applicants. It is argued the applicants already acknowledged the CIRB did not have the jurisdiction to determine the pension status of the individual applicants as is evidenced by the MOU where the Mint was requested by PSAC (and agreed) to make its best efforts to put the best case forward that the employees in question should be entitled to buy back service. The CIRB decision provides little assistance as to why the CIRB considered the individuals to be employees within the meaning of the  
 Code 
 .
