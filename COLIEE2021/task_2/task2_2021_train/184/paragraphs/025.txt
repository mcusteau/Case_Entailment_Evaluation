  The CIRB's jurisdiction, powers and duties are restricted by the  
 Code 
 . According to subsections 15(b) and (c) of the  
 Code 
 , the CIRB is empowered to make regulations respecting the determination of units appropriate for collective bargaining, as well as the certification of trade unions as bargaining agents for bargaining units. A plain reading of the definitions of "employee" and "employer" makes it clear that the CIRB has the power to determine employment status for the purposes of Part I- Industrial Relations of the  
 Code 
 . In doing so, the CIRB may find that certain individuals, working under a contract with a third party were, in fact, "employees" within the meaning of the  
 Code 
 . I therefore agree with the applicants that matters related to employment status at the Mint are squarely within the jurisdiction of the CIRB. However, I qualify the statement as follows: matters related to employment status at the Mint  
 for the purposes of the  
 Code 
  are squarely within the jurisdiction of the CIRB.
