  Given the express statutory definition, it was not unreasonable for the Officer to find the individual applicants were not employees of the Mint for the purposes of the  
 PSSA 
  during the Relevant Period. A clear and careful reading of the Contract (which was before the Officer) makes it apparent that Pro-Fac was responsible for a wide array of personnel matters including, most notably pay, supervision, deductions and leave. Further, the Mint was precluded from offering to employ or accepting for employment any Pro-Fac employees without Pro-Fac's written consent. The penalty for contravention of this provision was considerable: the Mint would be obliged to pay a sum equal to two years' salary of any employees it hired in violation of the Contract. In the absence of any persuasive jurisprudence or argumentation to support the allegation that the intention of the parties as evidenced by the terms of the Contract ought to be disregarded, I am of the opinion that the Officer's decision was not unreasonable.
