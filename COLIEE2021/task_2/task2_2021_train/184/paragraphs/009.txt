  In its decision, the CIRB concluded that true employees and dependent contractors (who by virtue of the  
 Code's 
  definition are considered to be "employees") will continue to have their rights protected by the  
 Code 
 . In this respect, subsection 18(3) does not directly restrict the rights of employees to be members of a bargaining unit. The CIRB relied on  
 Pointe-Claire (Ville) v. Syndicat des employées et employés professionnels-les et de bureau, section locale 57 (S.E.P.B. - U.I.E.P.B. - C.T.C. - F.T.Q.) 
 , [1997] 1 S.C.R. 1015; 211 N.R. 1 ( 
 Pointe-Claire 
 ), a case that has generally been applied by labour boards to identify the true employer in situations of tripartite arrangements. The CIRB highlighted the non-exhaustive list of factors elucidated in  
 Pointe-Claire 
  (the  
 Pointe-Claire 
  factors) which pertain to the employer-employee relationship, such as the selection process, hiring, training, discipline, evaluation, supervision, assignment of duties, remuneration and integration in the business. The CIRB acknowledged that there is no limit on the Mint's capacity to contract out for work or services. Nonetheless, in situations where individuals are working for the Mint under a contract for services, the relationship between these individuals and the Mint will be subject to examination within the context of the  
 Pointe-Claire 
  factors.
