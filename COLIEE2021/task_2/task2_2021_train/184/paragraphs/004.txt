  The applicant Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC), filed two applications with the Canadian Industrial Relations Board (the CIRB) seeking to include additional employees in an existing bargaining unit in respect of employees of the Mint. The matters raised similar issues and involved the same parties, thus, the CIRB decided to consolidate the matters. In order to protect the privacy of individuals, positions in question were identified according to an assigned number. Grievances filed by four of the five individual applicants were held in abeyance pending the outcome of the applications before the CIRB.
