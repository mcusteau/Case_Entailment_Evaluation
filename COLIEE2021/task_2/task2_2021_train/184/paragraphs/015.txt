  The applicants argue the  
 PSSA 
   
 contains no privitive clause 
 ; there is a  
 lack of relative expertise 
  of the Officer; the purpose of the  
 PSSA 
  is to establish the requirements and options for employees of the public service in regard to pension eligibility, contributions and benefits;  
 there are no balancing 
  interests nor does it establish a range of remedial choices of responses; and, that the  
 PSSA 
  confers no discretionary, policy or adjudicative functions upon the Officer in administering the  
 Act 
 , all of which favour a less deferential standard of review. The applicants characterize the issue of whether the individual applicants were employees within the meaning of the  
 PSSA 
  as being  
 purely legal in nature 
 . The applicants rely heavily on  
 National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada (CAW-Canada) Local 2182 et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) 
 , [2007] F.C.J. No. 613; 311 F.T.R. 91; 2007 FC 449, a recent decision of this Court which held that the appropriate standard of review for a decision of an administrator of the superannuation plan is correctness.
