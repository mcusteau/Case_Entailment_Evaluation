  As a result of the CIRB decision and the subsequent MOU, a representative of PSAC requested that PWGSC recognize the period within which the individual applicants were employed by Pro-Fac (the Relevant Period) as "pensionable service" in accordance with the  
 PSSA 
 . The Officer, having investigated the matter, rendered the impugned decision on May 23, 2006. In her decision, the Officer noted the Contract explicitly stipulates that all personnel assigned by Pro-Fac to fulfill its obligations " 
 shall be and shall remain the employees if the [Pro-Fac 
 ] who shall be responsible for the arrangement of substitutions, pay, supervision, discipline, unemployment insurance, Worker's compensation, leave and all other matters arising out of the relationship between employer and employee" (emphasis added in the impugned decision). The Officer relied on the documentation provided by the parties and a telephone conversation with Guy Bordeleau, a Human Resources officer at the Mint, to conclude that "it appeared to be a third-party contract situation" between the Mint and Pro-Fac. The Officer consulted with the Treasury Board Secretariat and PWGSC's own Legal Services and ultimately found that individuals hired through the auspices of a temporary help agency or a general contractor cannot be regarded as employees per the  
 PSSA 
 . Third party contract service would therefore not be countable as personable service under the  
 PSSA 
 . Accordingly, it was decided that the individual applicants should not have their dates of becoming a contributor to the  
 PSSA 
  amended retroactively.
