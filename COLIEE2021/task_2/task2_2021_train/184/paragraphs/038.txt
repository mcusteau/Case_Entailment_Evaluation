  Finally, based on the wording of the CIRB decision, I am of the opinion that the reasons were sufficient. I do not think the Officer was required to provide extensive reasons distinguishing the findings of the CIRB from her own since, as aforementioned, these decisions were rendered in consideration of different issues and non-overlapping statutory schemes.
