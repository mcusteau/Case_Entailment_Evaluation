  The respondent submits the evidence clearly establishes that during the Relevant Period the individual applicants worked at the Mint job site under the Contract the Mint had entered into with Pro-Fac. Indeed, the Contract specifically prohibited the Mint from hiring Pro-Fac employees without its express consent or else the Mint would face pecuniary consequences. The parties acted in a manner consistent with the fact that Pro-Fac was the employer and not the Mint. Finally, the respondent alleges the common law test for determining employee status is not relevant when, as occurs in this case, there is an express statutory definition of the term "employee". In the alternative, even if this Court decides the common law test is applicable, a review of the totality of the evidences favours a finding that the individual applicants were employees of Pro-Fac and not the Mint during the Relevant Period. The respondent argues it is disingenuous for the applicants to now contest the jurisdiction of the Officer when it was in fact PSAC that submitted the matter to PWGSC for review.
