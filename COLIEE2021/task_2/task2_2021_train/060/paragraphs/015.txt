 [15] 
  At paragraphs 11, 12 and 13 of his affidavit, Josue Jacquelin, Law Clerk at the applicant's counsel's firm, sets out what I take to be the crux of the applicant's submission: 
 
 
 
 I am hereby appealing to the Board not to prejudice Mr. Jean-Claude Kabende Emani as the Board's inability to contact him was through no fault of his but ours. 
 
 
 
 Our Law office takes full responsibility for the omission to provide our contact information as the claimant's counsel and failure to receive the claimant's e-mail regarding his contact information. 
 
 
 
 We hereby request that Mr. Jean-Claude Kabende Emani's claim be re-opened as he had no intention whatsoever of ever abandoning his refugee claim in Canada. Failure to re-open his refugee claim/application will make the claimant suffer irreparable harm and untold hardship that would unfairly render his statusless in Canada.
