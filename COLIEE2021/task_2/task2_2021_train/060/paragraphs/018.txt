  In the present case, there is no dispute that the applicant submitted his PIF in a timely manner. The PIF included his contact information at the time. The problem is that the Board was not informed when the applicant changed his address for the second time, due to errors on the part of counsel. Nonetheless, the fact that the applicant's PIF was duly submitted to the Board removes him from the purview of subsection 58(2) and brings him within 58(3). This latter provision requires that "in every other case" the Board "must give the claimant an opportunity to explain why the claim should not be declared abandoned".
