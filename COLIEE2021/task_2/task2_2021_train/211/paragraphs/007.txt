  The applicant's superiors at the Department of Justice supported her request for a leave of absence. On February 13, 2004, the Deputy Minister of Justice, Morris Rosenberg, wrote to the Commission to recommend that the leave of absence be granted. In Mr. Rosenberg's view, the applicant did not exercise considerable power in a very public and visible way over the people in the riding of St. Catharines and, consequently, there was no reason to deny her request for a leave of absence. Attached to Mr. Rosenberg's letter was the applicant's job description, an organizational chart and briefing notes prepared for the Deputy Minister.
