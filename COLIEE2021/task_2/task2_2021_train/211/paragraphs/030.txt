  The  
 fourth factor 
  is the nature of the problem in question. The decision in this case was fact-intensive because the Commission was required to determine the scope of the applicant's duties and assess whether, as a result of her responsibilities, her usefulness to the public service could be impaired. That said, the Commission did not hear viva voce evidence, it did not assess credibility, and it did not undertake its own effort to collect information relating to the applicant's duties - all of which represent the usual reasons for according greater deference to factual decisions. Accordingly, this factor is somewhat ambivalent.
