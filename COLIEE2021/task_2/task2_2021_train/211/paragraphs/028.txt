  The  
 second factor 
  to consider is whether the decision-making body has greater expertise than the reviewing court with respect to the question under review. In the present case, the Commission has some expertise relative to the Court because it is responsible for the supervision of the public service, it is charged with the on-going implementation of the  
 Public Service Employment Act 
  and it has experience in the application of subsection 33(3). This militates in favour of deference. That said, some of the considerations that the Commission is required to make under subsection 33(3) fall within the competence and particular expertise of the Court. For example, the decision to grant a leave of absence involves the balancing of constitutional values, namely, freedom of expression and political participation with the constitutional convention of political neutrality. This is the type of assessment that falls squarely within the expertise of the Court. Overall, this factor militates in favour of some deference.
