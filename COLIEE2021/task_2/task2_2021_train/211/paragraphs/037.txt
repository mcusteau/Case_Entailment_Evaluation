  The Commission also submits that it was not bound by the recommendation of the Department of Justice in making its determination, nor did it have a legal requirement to consult the Department. There is no doubt that the Commission has the sole authority to grant a leave of absence in such circumstances. Nonetheless, in my opinion, it should not have set aside the recommendation of the Deputy Minister lightly. The applicant's superiors at the Department of Justice are in the best position to know the scope of the applicant's responsibilities and to evaluate how visible her position was and is likely to be in the near future. Given this special vantage point, it seems only reasonable that the Commission would not set aside the recommendation of the Deputy Minister without conducting its own meaningful inquiry into the responsibilities of the applicant.
