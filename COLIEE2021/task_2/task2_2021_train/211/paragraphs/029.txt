  The  
 third factor 
  of the analysis involves a consideration of the purpose of the  
 Act 
 , as well as the particular provision at issue. The  
 Public Service Employment Act 
  aims to effectively manage the public service and protect its integrity. Similarly, the purpose of subsection 33(3) is to preserve the integrity and neutrality of the public service. As a result, the decision to grant a leave of absence involves some balancing of policy issues. Moreover, the decision is highly discretionary. These factors signal that greater deference should be accorded to the Commission. However, in favour of a stricter standard, the decision in question focuses narrowly on the applicant's rights and interests as opposed to balancing the interests of various constituents or mediating among them. Consequently, this factor yields mixed results.
