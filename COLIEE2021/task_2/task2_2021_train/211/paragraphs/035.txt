  Unfortunately, the Commission adopted an overly simplistic approach in its analysis. I agree that the inquiry must be forward looking since the concern is whether the employee's usefulness could be impaired once she returns from leave. However, it is not reasonable for the Commission to consider every remote possible responsibility that might fall within the scope of the employee's position at some future point in time. It is only reasonable for the Commission to conduct its inquiry into the applicant's responsibilities within some realistic context. In particular, since the applicant would have returned to her job within a few months had she not been successful in the election, the Commission should have considered what responsibilities the applicant was likely to have in the near future. This inquiry would have provided a more realistic picture of whether her usefulness to the public service could be impaired upon her return. In deciding what responsibilities the applicant was likely to have in the near future, the Commission might have considered, among other things, the types of cases that the applicant was currently responsible for as well as how long she had been in her position.
