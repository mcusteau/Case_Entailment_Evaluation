Finally, the Board did not err by not giving any weight to the psychologist's report. The Board member indeed noted that the report was a "sympathetic report" and that she herself "perceived this sympathy and the psychologist's assessment of the credibility of the claimant upon reading it. However, this impression was not sustained by me after hearing the claimant's testimony." The fact that the psychologist was not aware of all aspects of the applicant's life (it appears that the psychologist was not aware that a certain Mr. Cho sexually exploited her and that she had been working in a massage parlour) and that the Board had found the applicant not credible, constituted valid reasons to discard this latter evidence.
