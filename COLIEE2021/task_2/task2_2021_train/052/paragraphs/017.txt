 In practice, international human rights sources reported in 2004 and in early 2005 that many of Mexico's human rights violations stem from structural deficiencies in its criminal justice system (HRW 8 Jan. 2005; AI 2004). For example, Amnesty International's 2004 annual report (ibid.) and Human Rights Watch's World Report 2005 (8 Jan. 2005) noted that cases of torture, arbitrary detention, and extortion within the judicial system, especially at the state level, continued to be reported in an atmosphere of impunity in 2003 and 2004. Country Reports 2004 added that while efforts to reform the judiciary were being made in 2004, concerns such as "lengthy pretrial detention, lack of due process, and judicial inefficiency and corruption persisted" (28 Feb. 2005). 
 
 
 
 In June 2004, Alejandro Gertz Manero, then-Federal Secretary of the Secretariat of Public Security (Secretaría de Seguridad Pública, SSP) was quoted as describing the country's justice system as being outdated, lacking in credibility, and unresponsive to the needs of Mexican society (FBIS 30 June 2004). According to a 2004 public opinion poll conducted by Corporación Latinobarómetro, 58 per cent of the Mexican respondents claimed that it was quite possible to bribe a judge in order to receive a favourable sentence (sentencia favorable) (13 Aug. 2004). 
 
 
 
 Key points discussed at a July 2004 conference on justice reform in Mexico, sponsored by the US-based Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) and the Center for US-Mexican Studies, included statements that the criminal justice system was "both ineffective and unfair" (CSIS 16 July 2004). At the conference, numerous national and international justice reform experts claimed that in Mexico "[fewer] than 5 per cent of crimes are investigated and [fewer than] 2 per cent go to trial" (ibid.). Moreover, the criminal justice system was deemed unfair due to its use of arbitrary detention, delays in trial and sentencing, "incarceration without sentencing" or pretrial detention and "poor legal defence" (ibid.; see also AI 28 Sept. 2004). 
 
 
 
 Various sources reported that, among the criticisms of the judicial process, the use of pre-trial detention (prisión preventiva) was of particular concern (ibid.; OSJI Nov. 2004; CSIS 16 July 2004). During the July 2004 justice reform conference sponsored by CSIS and the Center for US-Mexican Studies, experts concurred that pre-trial detention "impedes the prosecutorial process and contributes to a system that jails large numbers of people" (ibid.). In a November 2004 publication of the Open Society Justice Initiative (OSJI), author and public security expert Guillermo Zepeda stated that about 82,000 incarcerated individuals were then waiting for a court appearance in Mexico, some for having committed only minor offences (11 Nov. 2004). Zepeda's study also argued that pre-trial detention has not reduced crime rates, does not effectively guarantee victim compensation, and is not cost-efficient (OSJI 11 Nov. 2004). 
 
 
 
 As well, Country Reports 2004 noted that authorities did not ensure legal representation for poor defendants (28 Feb. 2005, Sec. 1.c). In particular, "[d] efendants in pretrial detention did not have immediate access to an attorney to discuss privately issues arising during the hearings. Moreover, the public defender system was not adequate to meet the need" (Country Reports 2004 28 Feb. 2005, Sec. 1.c).
