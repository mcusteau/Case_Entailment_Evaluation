Lewis
, supra, Stone, J., held at p. 92 that the applicant had not been treated fairly by the initial decision-maker. Nonetheless, the court ruled that the statutory remedy was adequate since the procedural defect could have been cured. Stone, J., relied in particular on the judgment of Beetz, J., in
Harelkin v. University of Regina
, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561; 26 N.R. 364. Beetz, J., listed the factors which the court should take into account in deciding whether another adequate remedy exists. He said at p. 588 [S.C.R.]:
"In order to evaluate whether appellant's right of appeal to the senate committee constituted an adequate alternative remedy and even a better remedy than a recourse to the courts by way of prerogative writs, several factors should have been taken into consideration among which [sic] the procedure on the appeal, the composition of the senate committee, its powers and the manner in which they were probably to be exercised by a body which was not a professional court of appeal and was not bound to act exactly as one nor likely to do so. Other relevant factors include the burden of a previous finding, expeditiousness and costs."
