The exception described in
Johnston
, supra, is not applicable to the case at bar since the applicant received all the PSRs applicable to his certiorari application. Even Béliveau, J., in
Johnston
acknowledged the strong trend in the courts [see footnote 1], regarded as [TRANSLATION] "unanimous" by Mayrand, J., at p. 20 of
Plamondon v. Viau et al.
, June 26, 1991, Montréal 500-36-000329-915 (S.C.), that the rule of exhausting remedies should be followed. At p. 3012 Béliveau, J., wrote:
[TRANSLATION]
"Finally, the court feels it should reiterate the rule that the remedy is discretionary so that the principle applicable to custodial matters remains that remedies should be exhausted, at least when they are equivalent. However, as the exercise of discretion is involved
and it is far from clear that the alternate remedies are equivalent
, the undersigned considers that here it is in the interest of the administration of justice and of the parties to resolve the question through habeas corpus." (My emphasis)
