The court is not entirely satisfied with the phrase [TRANSLATION] "still has maximum", the second aspect of the respondent's reasons. Is this general statement too broad to be accepted by a court responsible for protecting an individual's right to fair treatment? Other reasons for denying the transfer were given in the respondent's affidavit but are not mentioned in the memorandum dated August 29, 1995. As proof of the applicant's "still maximum" security classification, the respondent offered his negative and aggressive attitude to persons responsible for his work and his noninvolvement in institutional programs since his arrival at Donnacona (Exhibit I-8). The same facts were cited by the NPB in its reasons (p. 3, Exhibit R-2). Despite these doubts as to the scope of the reasons, the court accepts that the respondent did not have to entirely reiterate the analysis prepared for determining his security classification. Moreover, the PSR of August 14, 1995 supplied to the applicant clearly and expressly referred to the PSR of January 31, 1995 and the determination of the applicant's security classification which is set out there in detail. The PSR dated August 14, 1995 incorporated the security classification given in the PSR dated January 31, 1995 and indicated that the transfer sought by the inmate was not recommended by the CSC because [TRANSLATION] "the inmate does not meet the security classification of the institution requested". The PSR of January 31, 1995 set out in seven page detail the reasons for making the decision to increase the applicant's security classification. Although all this elaborate procedure for jumping from one report to another does not meet the requirements of efficiency, the court concludes that the respondent's reasons did not represent a
flagrant
breach of natural justice.
