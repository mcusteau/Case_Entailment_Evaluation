[31]
At the hearing held on January 10, 1997 the court gave the applicant permission to file an application based on rule 324 of the
Federal Court Rules
. This is an application for an extension of time to file an additional affidavit, namely the applicant's own affidavit, in support of the application for judicial review. The affidavit was accompanied by grievance documents dealing with the applicant's transfer from Leclerc to Donnacona and the determination of the applicant's security classification. The letter from Pierre Viau, Warden of Leclerc, dated May 12, 1995 was also attached to the affidavit. For this affidavit the applicant was sworn by his counsel in the instant case. The court concludes that the affidavit was very late and also void as not having been properly sworn. Further, as judicial review is not admissible for the reasons given above, the court dismisses the application and denies the applicant leave to file a third affidavit in support of the application for judicial review.
Application dismissed.
