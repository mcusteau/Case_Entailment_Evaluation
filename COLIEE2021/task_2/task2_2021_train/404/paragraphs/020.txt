There are two aspects to the respondent's reasons dated August 29, 1995: (1) the escape conspiracy and (2) the general security classification. The court recognizes that, as counsel for the respondent admitted at the oral hearing, these reasons are anything but extensive or verbose. At the same time, the court rejects the applicant's argument that he could not exercise his right to submit observations without details being provided or a public hearing held on the nature of the allegations made against him. In the applicant's submission, he was never able to make a full defence to the allegations that he was involved, or suspected of being involved, in one or two escape conspiracies, since he never came before the disciplinary tribunal and was never the subject of any criminal proceedings. However, in this situation where a voluntary transfer is denied in a prison natural justice does not require an exhaustive summary of the reasons, a disciplinary tribunal or criminal proceedings. As Pinard, J., noted in
Desjardins v. National Parole Board et al.
(1989), 29 F.T.R. 38 (T.D.), at p. 41: "... the rules of natural justice and fairness are common law rules that are flexible in the sense that they have to be applied in the circumstances of the particular case." Strayer, J., also wrote in
Camphaug
, supra, at p. 167:
"... that a decision to transfer is not like a conviction for an offence: what is required on the part of the decision-maker is a reasonable belief that the prisoner should be moved for the sake of the orderly and proper administration of the institution. This implies that fairness in the making of such a decision does not require that the inmate be given all the particulars of the alleged wrongdoings; it is sufficient if he can make representations to demonstrate that the recommendation that he be moved is an unreasonable one."
