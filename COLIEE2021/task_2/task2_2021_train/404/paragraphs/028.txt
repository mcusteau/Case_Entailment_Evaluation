Despite the minor reservations mentioned, the court considers that the alternate remedy in the case at bar - the grievance procedure laid down in the
Regulations
and Commissioner's Directives - is adequate. The purpose of Directive No. 81, "Inmate Complaints and Grievances" is stated in s. 1 to be: "To ensure that inmate complaints and grievances are dealt with promptly and fairly at the lowest level possible in a manner that is consistent with the spirit and intent of the Mission Document." To attain this end the
Regulations
create a system of redress in which decisions are given to the offender "as soon as practicable" (five or six working days depending on the level of the decision-maker - Directive No. 81). The
Regulations
further provide for the participation of inmate grievance committees (s. 77(1) - where they exist at the institution), outside review boards (s. 79(1)) and complaints in writing.
