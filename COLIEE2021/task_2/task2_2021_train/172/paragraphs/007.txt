  But Mr. Pannu was subsequently found inadmissible to Canada. He had lied on his application to immigrate, claiming he was the dependent son of a woman who was not his mother. His mother had died in 1987. Mr. Pannu was ordered deported from Canada on September 12, 2001. Ms. Pannu was included in the removal order, and thereafter made another series of claims: 
 
 
 
 4.  
 Appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division – with Mr. Pannu: 
  The couple appealed the removal order under paragraph 70(1)(b) of the old Immigration Act. That paragraph gave the Board’s Immigration Appeal Division the authority to quash or stay a removal order under its equitable jurisdiction. The Board could consider foreign hardship a permanent resident might face if removed from Canada. Their appeal was dismissed, in a decision dated April 26, 2002. 
 
 
 
 5.  
 H&C Application and PRRA – with Mr. Pannu: 
  The couple made an H&C application in June, 2002, and applied for a PRRA in June, 2003. Both were refused in January 2004. The couple signed a separation agreement on December 22, 2004. 
 
 
 
 6.  
 Judicial Review of Negative PRRA Decision – with Mr. Pannu 
 : The couple’s application for judicial review was rejected on November 26, 2004. 
 
 
 
 7.  
 Refugee Claim #2 – Ms. Pannu only: 
  Ms. Pannu claimed Convention refugee status again on November 12, 2003. Her claim was refused on October 21, 2004, for credibility reasons. 
 
 
 
 8. H&C Application #3 – Ms. Pannu only: Ms. Pannu made a third H&C application under subsection 25(1) of the IRPA on December 24, 2004. It was refused on November 29, 2005. That is the decision under review in this hearing.
