 Montigny, J. 
 : Ms. Pannu has lived in Canada since 1988, when she moved here from India. After a series of events I will recount below, both of Ms. Pannuâ€™s previous two sponsors were declared inadmissible and deported. She has lived here without status since December 1998, when her work permit expired. In December 2004, Ms. Pannu made her third humanitarian and compassionate application (H&C), hoping to have her application for permanent residence processed in Canada. The immigration officer, Courtnay Petschulat, refused her application in a decision dated November 29, 2005. This is a judicial review of that decision.
