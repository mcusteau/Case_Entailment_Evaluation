  Before turning to the substance of the Applicant’s claims, it bears repeating that the relief under section 25 of the IRPA is an exceptional remedy dependent on the Minister’s discretion. An applicant is not entitled to a particular outcome, even if there are compelling humanitarian and compassionate considerations at play. The Minister can balance humanitarian and compassionate considerations against public interest reasons that might exist for refusing to grant an exceptional remedy. The person making an H&C application has the onus to bring any relevant evidence to the officer’s attention and to satisfy the officer that, in his or her personal circumstances, the requirement to obtain a visa from outside Canada in the normal manner would cause unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship. The fact that Canada is a more desirable place to live than the country of removal is not determinative of an H&C application (Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 125, [2002] 4 F.C. 358 at paragraphs 14-20; Serda v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 356 at paragraphs 20-23; Owusu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FCA 38).
