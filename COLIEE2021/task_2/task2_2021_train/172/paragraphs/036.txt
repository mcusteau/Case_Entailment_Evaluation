  Ms. Pannuâ€™s counsel also contended that the officer applied the wrong test when it assessed whether the Applicant had provided sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds. He focused his argument on the last paragraph of her reasons, where she wrote: 
 
 
 
 I have considered all information regarding this application as a whole. Having reviewed and considered the grounds the applicant has forwarded, I am not satisfied that sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist to approve this exemption request. A request for humanitarian and compassionate consideration is not in place to serve as an alternative stream for immigration to Canada. I am satisfied that the applicant would be able to apply to immigrate to Canada through the standard overseas procedures without requiring an exemption from the usual requirements without putting her at risk to life or risk to her personal security.
