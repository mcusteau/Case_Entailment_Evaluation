In coming to the conclusion that the impugned decision is unreasonable, I am mindful of the argument made by the respondent that the fact that the RPD reasons do not canvass every piece of evidence does not indicate that the decision maker did not consider these documents and is generally not fatal to its final decision. However, this is a rebuttable presumption
