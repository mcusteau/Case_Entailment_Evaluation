  The evidence contained in paragraphs 15 and 17 of Mr. Slaeman's Affidavit and paragraph 9 of Ms. Roukan's Affidavit, however, is not admissible. It does not fall within one of the recognized exceptions to the general rule that a court is limited on a judicial review application to considering the record before the tribunal. Indeed, admitting this evidence would be completely inimical to the judicial review process, and would invite applicants to conduct a  
 de novo 
  trial, which is certainly not the requisite inquiry on a judicial review application. As Justice de Montigny noted in  
 Ochapowace Indian 
   
 Band 
  at para 10, "[t]he purpose of a judicial review application is not to determine whether the decision of a tribunal was correct in absolute terms but rather to determine whether its decision was correct [or reasonable] on the basis of the record before it". Thus, the respondent's request to strike portions of the applicants' affidavits is successful only with respect to paragraphs 15 and 17 of Mr. Slaeman's Affidavit and paragraph 9 of Ms. Roukan's Affidavit.
