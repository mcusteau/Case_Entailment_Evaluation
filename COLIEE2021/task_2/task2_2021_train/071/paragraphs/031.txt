  Apart from the obvious inconsistency of this position with the prior argument regarding the applicants' inability to understand the documents disclosed to them, the applicants' second argument has no merit because it bears no relevance to what actually transpired and the non-disclosed items are completely irrelevant to the determination the adjudicator was called upon to make. Much more relevant matters  
 were 
  disclosed by Passport Canada to the Applicants, which would have necessitated the same response by the applicants regarding their theory of what had transpired, yet, the applicants provided no submissions in their defence to Passport Canada nor to the adjudicator.
