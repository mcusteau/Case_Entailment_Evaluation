  In several of the impugned paragraphs, the applicants attest to their lack of fluency in English language, state that another individual completed all the written representations that they provided to Passport Canada and to the Edmonton police, and claim that they did not fully understand what was contained in these representations. They explain that their lack of understanding resulted in certain of the discrepancies which the adjudicator noted in his decision. In another of the impugned paragraphs in Mr. Slaeman's Affidavit, he suggests that one of his sons, who "has had several problems with the law revolving around drugs, gangs and violence", might have stolen the passports, without the knowledge of the applicants. The final fact set out in the impugned paragraphs is the applicants' claim that they do not know the impostors who sought to fraudulently use their passports and citizenship cards to attempt to board a flight from Dubai to Toronto.
