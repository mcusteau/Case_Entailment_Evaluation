 Kamel 
  did not decide that Passport Canada must disclose every matter it inquires into or even that it must disclose every document that it provides to the decision-maker. Rather, it held that Passport Canada must disclose to both the decision-maker and the individual under investigation all the information it gathered that is relevant to the determination to be made. Arguably, the above-cited passages from  
 Kamel 
  may go slightly further and provide that any information given to the decision-maker must also be provided to the applicant, even if it is immaterial. However, the need to disclose immaterial information was not squarely addressed in  
 Kamel 
  as the case concerned a highly relevant and prejudicial report that was provided to the Minister - but not to Mr. Kamel -which played a central role in the Minster's decision to permanently suspend passport services for Mr. Kamel. In my view, Justice NoÃ«l's comments regarding what must be disclosed by Passport Canada should be read bearing these facts in mind, and, accordingly, do not stand for the proposition that it is a breach of natural justice for Passport Canada to fail to disclose irrelevant documents that it might send to the adjudicator. While it might be a more prudent practice for Passport Canada to provide identical disclosure to the adjudicator and the individuals under investigation (and thereby ensure it would be immune from challenges of this nature), in my view, there is no breach of natural justice where, as here, buried in the file forwarded to the adjudicator there are a few irrelevant facts that were not disclosed to the individuals under investigation.
