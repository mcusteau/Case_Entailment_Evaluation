  With respect, such an assertion is entirely without merit. In my view, no reasonable person would be led to any such conclusion, based on this single line in the witness statement and on the contradictory letters filed by the applicants. This is particularly so where, as here, the applicants sent several letters to Passport Canada, in English, and did not once indicate that they were having difficulty understanding the correspondence. On these facts, there was simply no basis upon which Passport Canada could ever have ascertained that the applicants might be facing communication difficulties.
