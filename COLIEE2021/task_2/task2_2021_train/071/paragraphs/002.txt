  Following the seizure of the applicants' passports from the impostors, Passport Canada carried out an investigation and eventually made a recommendation to the adjudicator to revoke the applicants' passports and impose a five-year ban on their obtaining another Canadian passport. The adjudicator accepted the recommendation in his decision of July 19, 2011. In this application for judicial review, the applicants assert that the adjudicator's decision should be set aside due to flaws in both Passport Canada's investigation and the adjudicator's decision.
