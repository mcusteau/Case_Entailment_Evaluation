  Thus, paragraphs 2-5 and 9 of Mr. Slaeman's Affidavit and paragraphs 2-4 of Ms. Roukan's Affidavit are admissible in this judicial review application. In this regard, I find no merit in the suggestion of the respondent that the Court should determine admissibility of this type of evidence only after it determines whether or not there is merit to the breach of procedural fairness claim. Were the Court to proceed as the respondent argues it should, it would be engaged in a completely circuitous exercise where the merits of the claim would depend on evidence which would not be before the Court unless and until the claim is found to be meritorious. Such circularity cannot possibly be the basis upon which admissibility is determined. Rather, in my view, admissibility depends upon the characterization of the evidence. If it fairly relates to a procedural fairness claim, then it is admissible. As noted, the evidence contained in paragraphs 2-5 and 9 of Mr. Slaeman's Affidavit and paragraphs 2-4 of Ms. Roukan's Affidavit does relate to their procedural fairness claims. It is therefore properly before the Court.
