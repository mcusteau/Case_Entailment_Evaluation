  Turning to the applicant's second allegation, this case and that of  
 Abdi, Hashi and Abshir v The Attorney General of Canada 
  (2012 FC 642), released concurrently with this decision) involve the application of the broad principles from  
 Baker 
  and  
 Kamel 
  to fact patterns that are very different from that in  
 Kamel 
  and from each other. In both this case and that of  
 Abdi, Hashi and Abshir 
 , the applicants argue that Passport Canada ought to have disclosed copies of its entire file to them or, alternatively, that certain pieces of information or, in the case of'  
 Abdi, Hashi and Abshir 
 , certain documents amounting effectively to written advocacy, ought to have been disclosed.
