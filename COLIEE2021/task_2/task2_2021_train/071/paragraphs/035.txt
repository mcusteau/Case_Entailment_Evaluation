  Before the Court, the applicants assert that someone stole their passports in the manner suggested in Passport Canada's December 3, 2010 letter. The suggestion is that this person might have been Mr. Slaeman's son, as set out in paragraph 15 of Mr. Slaeman's Affidavit. However, no explanation was given as to why the applicants did not make this submission to Passport Canada. This claim is central to their defense.
