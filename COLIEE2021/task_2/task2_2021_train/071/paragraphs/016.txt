 [16] 
  This general rule was recently affirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada and the University of Manitoba v the Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency 
 , 2012 FCA 22 at paras 17-20. As noted by Justice Stratas in that decision at paras 18-19, the differing roles of the Court and the administrative body underlie the rule: the role of the Court is to "review the overall legality of what the Board has done, not delve into or re-decide the merits of what the Board has done ... [the] Court cannot allow itself to become a forum for fact-finding on the merits of the matter."
