 [10] 
  In my view, the issues that arise in this application may be stated as follows: 
 
 
 
 1. As a preliminary matter, have the applicants filed evidence that was not before the adjudicator, and should this evidence be excluded from consideration in this judicial review application; 
 
 
 
 2. Were the applicants afforded procedural fairness; 
 
 
 
 3. Were the Passport Canada investigators biased; and 
 
 
 
 4. Was the adjudicator's decision reasonable
