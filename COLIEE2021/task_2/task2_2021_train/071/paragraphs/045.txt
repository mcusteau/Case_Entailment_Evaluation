 [45] 
  In the present case, the applicants assert that the adjudicator's factual determinations were unreasonable. In  
 Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa 
 , 2009 SCC 12, [2009] 1 SCR 339 [ 
 Khosa 
 ], the Supreme Court of Canada held that judicial review pursuant to sections 18 and 18.1 of the  
 Federal Courts Act 
 , RSC 1985, c F-7 [FCA] is governed by the common law principles set out in  
 Dunsmuir 
  and that section 18.1(4)(d) of the FCA provides "legislative precision to the reasonableness standard" by which factual findings are to be measured ( 
 Khosa 
  at para 46). Section 18.1(4)(d) of the FCA provides that this Court may set aside a tribunal's decision if it is satisfied that the tribunal "based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact it made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard to the material before it".
