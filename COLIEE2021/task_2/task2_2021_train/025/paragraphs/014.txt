  With respect, I cannot agree with the applicant's argument. The evidence proffered by the applicant demonstrates that she has, in fact, suffered both physical and psychological trauma from the abuse and harm inflicted on her by her ex-partner. This was not questioned by the Board and is not at issue in this application. Rather, what is at issue is whether such evidence is relevant to a finding that the applicant could have obtained state protection in the Federal District of Mexico City. In my view, such evidence is  
 not 
  relevant to the Board's finding.
