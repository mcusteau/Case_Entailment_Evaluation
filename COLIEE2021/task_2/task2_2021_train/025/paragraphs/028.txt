  I have concluded that the Board's decision was unreasonable in two respects: 
 
 
 
 1) the Board misunderstood that the applicant was "physically attacked in front of her mother in Mexico City." In fact, the applicant's PIF states in paragraph 10: 
 
 
 
 ... As a result, I returned to the home of my mother in Pachuca where I hid until the end of May, 2005 when [the abuser] found me, pushed my mother aside, slapped my face and told me that he expected me to return to him. 
 
 
 
 The Board based its decision on the misunderstanding that the assault took place in Mexico City and that the claimant did not contact the authorities in Mexico City, where the Board considered the police would be more effective than in Pachuca. In fact, the assault took place in Pachuca, where the applicant had previously made a complaint against the politician and was told the police would not take a denunciation against such a well-known individual. The Board's conclusion that "it is speculation on the part of the applicant as to how the authorities ... might react" is clearly unreasonable since the applicant had already reported the abuser to the police in the Pachuca; and 
 
 
 
 2) the decision is unreasonable because the obvious question in this case was not addressed by the Board, namely whether the public authorities including the police will protect the young applicant, the mistress of the politician, and prosecute the politician for assaults.
