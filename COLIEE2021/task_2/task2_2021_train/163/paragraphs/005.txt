  On December 12, 2005, Health Canada wrote to Apotex to inform them that Health Canada had taken the position that section 5 of the Patented Medicines (Notice of Compliance) Regulations, SOR/93-133 (PMNOC Regulations), as amended, was only triggered in what concerns Apo-perindopril 2 and 4 mg tablets, and thus that Apotex was only required to address the 196 Patent in respect of COVERSYL 2 and 4 mg tablets. This decision was based on the fact that on March 15, 2001, Servier Canada had filed Form IV Patent Lists listing the 196 Patent in respect of COVERSYL 2 and 4 mg tablets, but did not file a Form IV Patent List in respect of COVERSYL 8 mg tablets.
