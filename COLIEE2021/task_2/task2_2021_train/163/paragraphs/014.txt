  The Applicants, for their part, argue that there is only decision at issue, namely the December 12, 2005 decision of the Minister. According to the Applicants, the issuance of the NOC for Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets was a consequence of the Ministerâ€™s December 12, 2005 finding that the PMNOC Regulations were not engaged in what concerns Apo-perindopril 8 mg tablets. Thus, the Applicants claim that the amendments they seek to make to their Original Application are justified, as a change of circumstance has taken place, and the amendments would allow the Court to deal with the issues at stake in the most efficient and economical manner.
