 [6] 
  The right to a hearing in the context of PRRA proceedings exists when credibility is the key element on which the officer bases his or her decision and without which the decision would have no basis. It has been held that PRRA proceedings without a hearing (under IRPA), and in which the applicant's position is explained in writing, are in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice. (See Suresh v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3 and Youmis v. Solicitor General of Canada, [2004] F.C. 266, paragraph 6). Therefore, there was no violation of the fundamental rights provided in section 7 of the Charter.
