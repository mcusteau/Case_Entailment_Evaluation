Some years ago, this Court recognized that there was more than one valid approach to determining whether an applicant had met the residency requirement of the
Act
. The two principal approaches involve, on the one hand, a purely physical test and, on the other, a qualitative test of residency:
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Nandre
(2003), 234 F.T.R. 245; 2003 FCT 650, at para. 11. In
Nandre
, I concluded, citing six main reasons, that where a citizenship judge finds that an applicant had not satisfied the physical test, he or she has an obligation to go on to apply the qualitative test. The latter involves an inquiry, based on a consideration of several factors, into whether the applicant had established and maintained a residence in Canada for the required period. The relevant factors appeared in
Koo, Re
, [1993] 1 F.C. 286; 59 F.T.R. 27 (T.D.).
