Mr. Dedaj left Albania in 1997 and moved to the United States where he met and married his wife. He arrived in Canada in 2002, made a successful refugee claim, and became a permanent resident in 2005. He claims to have been physically present in Canada from October 2, 2002 until August 30, 2007, the day he submitted his citizenship application. Because he was credited a half day for every day of physical presence in Canada prior to becoming a permanent resident, and a full day for every day thereafter, he achieved, in his view, exactly 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada as of August 30, 2007.
