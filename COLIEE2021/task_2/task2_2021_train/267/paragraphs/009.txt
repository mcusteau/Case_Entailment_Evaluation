In his written reply argument, said by the applicant to be this final submission, he raises a question about the term, and therefore the validity, of the respondent's chairman's appointment. That question is legally vapid, but more to the immediate point it is a matter of neither reply nor rebuttal in the course of the argumentation of the parties. Accordingly that aspect of the applicant's written argument is simply to be ignored in these proceedings. The parties' submissions therefore are complete and closed.
