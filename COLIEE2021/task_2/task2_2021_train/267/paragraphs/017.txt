As an independent tribunal, the board is not legally obliged to conform its decisions to favourable recommendations, but rather, only to consider them. It may properly find greater weight in other considerations properly before it, such as the applicant's institutional behaviour. This court is not entitled to usurp the board's function. Even if the court would have come to the opposite conclusion, if it were charged with the same responsibilities as is the board, so long as the board acts within its jurisdiction, the court will not command the board to render a different decision. There is no basis here for finding that the decision involved an unreasonable exercise of discretion. That being so, the respondent's decision is also not to be quashed in this sense, either.
