What the applicant does not mention in his affidavit is one of the factors mentioned in Ex. K, "institutional behaviour-offences". In the applicant's case that is a factual factor. For the respondent there was filed the affidavit of Nan Georgina Harrison, a member of the respondent board who received the applicant's application for day parole dated March 21, 1985. She and two other members of the board reviewed that application in September, 1985. The reasons given to the applicant (named: Christopher MacDonald) for not granting him day parole, according to this affiant, were communicated to him in a notification dated September 17, 1985, a copy of which is Ex. C to her affidavit:
"You are serving a relatively long sentence for a serious offence you have been involved in contraband within the institution and a further offence-free period is necessary to prove credibility. The board does not believe that you have gained the maximum benefit from incarceration, nor has the deterrent aspect of your sentence been achieved."
