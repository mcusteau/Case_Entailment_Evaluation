This finding that the respondent board's decision-making process in regard to the applicant's request for day parole meets the tests of the Bill of Rights and the Charter, still leaves one further consideration at large. The relief which the applicant seeks here is discretionary on the part of the court. Ordinarily the court will not even consider a favourable exercise of discretion unless and until the applicant has exhausted all avenuse of redress and appeal before invoking the court's powers. According to Mr. Labelle the respondent's vice-chairman, and Mr. Simmons who, and whose staff, have custody and control of the applicant's file among others, the applicant never made any "Request for Re-examination of Decision" to the Appeal Committee of the board after his application for day parole had been denied. No extraordinary reasons for by-passing a request for re-examination of that decision have been placed herein before the court. Accordingly, the court ought not to, and will not, exercise its discretion in favour of the applicant's motion for an order to compel the respondent to provide a new, and in-person hearing for his application.
