Mr. Justice Beetz who wrote for those judges who based their decision in the Singh case on the provisions of the Bill of Rights, is reported as noting at pp. 229 and 230 S.C.R.:
"I do not wish to suggest that the principles of fundamental justice will impose an oral hearing in all cases. In Attorney General of Canada v. Inuit Tapirisat of Canada, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 735, at p. 747, Estey, J., speaking for the court quoted Tucker, L.J. in Russell v. Duke of Norfolk, [1949] 1 All E.R. 109 (C.A.), at p. 118:"
'The requirements of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the tribunal is acting, the subject matter that is being dealt with, and so forth.'
"The most important factors in determining the procedural content of fundamental justice in a given case are the nature of the legal rights at issue and the severity of the consequences to the individuals concerned. In the same Inuit Tapirisat case, at the same page, Estey, J., also quoted Lord Denning, M.R., in Selvarajan v. Race Relations Board, [1976] All E.R. 12 (C.A.), at p. 19:
'... that which fairness requires depends on the nature of the investigation and the consequences which it may have on persons affected by it. The fundamental rule is that, if a person may be subjected to pains or penalties, or be exposed to prosecution or proceedings or deprived of remedies or redress, or in some such way adversely affected by the investigation and report, then he should be told the case made against him and be afforded a fair opportunity of answering it.'"
