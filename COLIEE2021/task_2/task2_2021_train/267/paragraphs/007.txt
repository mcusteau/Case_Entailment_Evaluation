There is yet another factor to consider. The court cannot compel an individual applicant to be represented by counsel, advisable as that may be, because every individual who complies with the procedural rules has an undeniable right to access to, and audience in, the court, subject always to normal requirements of decorum. Not everyone--indeed, not every barrister--is effective in expressing oral submissions to a tribunal. So, to deny unrepresented prisoners the access afforded by Rule 324, could well be to compel a perhaps inarticulate, illeducated person (unlike the present applicant) to make a hopelessly inept and ineffectual oral submission, if that person be determined to place his complaints before the court. More appropriate is to permit a prisoner, at the utterly inconsequential risk of displaying shaky spelling and grammar, to reflect upon his or her words in composing written submissions at a time of his or her own choosing and perhaps with the aid of someone more literate than the applicant.
