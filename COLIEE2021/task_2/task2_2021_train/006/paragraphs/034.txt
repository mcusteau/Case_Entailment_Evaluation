  Therefore, the suggestion made by the Board that women are randomly raped in Haiti by criminals is not supported by the evidence; while women are targeted for kidnapping just like men, they are raped because they are women. Likewise, young boys may be abused because they are part of a vulnerable social group. The fact that there has been "horrific sexual abuse of young boys by UN peace keeping forces from Sri Lanka" does not help to sustain the reasonableness of the Board's general conclusion. Again, the real issue is whether such violence is a serious violation of a fundamental human right for a Convention ground and the Board's analysis in this regard is perfunctory and biased.
