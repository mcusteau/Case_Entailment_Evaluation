  First, the Court finds that the Board's conclusions of fact as to the apolitical nature of organized criminal groups are reasonable. Even if one accepts that political motive can coexist with non-Convention grounds, the evidence before the Board was highly speculative and virtually untied to political involvement (or leading to an inference that political motive could constitute a secondary ground). This part of the Board's decision is entirely supported by the evidence and thus the Court has no grounds to interfere.
