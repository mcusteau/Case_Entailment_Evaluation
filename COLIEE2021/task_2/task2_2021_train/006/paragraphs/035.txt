  The fact that the applicant "is a married 30 year old not an under 18 year old, single female" has strongly influenced the dismissal of this claim. The Court is also appalled by certain gratuitous statements of the Board, such as "rape is not the motive for criminal violence against women", "[g]ender is not a variable in such a calculation" (in the case of kidnapped women who are raped), "'genderless' is a rather meaningless word", and "the perpetrators of rape in Haiti ... [are] mostly poor, young, uneducated, males". Such a stereotypical view further confirms that the Board member did not have an open mind or otherwise suggests a pernicious form of bias which severely taints the reasonableness of the result.
