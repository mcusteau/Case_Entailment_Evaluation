  In  
 Frederic v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
 , [2010] F.T.R. Uned. 731; 2010 FC 1100, the Court was tasked with evaluating whether the Board's conclusion that fear of sexual assault cannot give rise to refugee protection because it amounts to a general fear of crime which affects the entire population of Haiti, and not a particular social group, was reasonable. Justice O'Reilly of this Court dismissed the application, but explicitly stated at paragraph 11 that: 
 
 
 
 "... while the issues raised in this case are difficult and merit, in appropriate circumstances, serious scrutiny both by the Board and this Court, this is not an apt case to analyze them thoroughly. As mentioned, the proposition that a woman's fear of sexual violence could form the basis of a refugee claim was not the main thrust of Ms. Frederic's application. Accordingly, the evidence before the Board was not as extensive as one might otherwise have expected, and the submissions on the point were not as detailed as they might have been in a case in which the issue was central to the claim."
