  The Tribunal first pointed out that the onus is on an applicant to prove that the pension decision was incorrect. It then noted that the applicant had no Canadian lease papers from 1976 to 1978 to demonstrate residence in Canada. It inferred from the record that her furniture had been kept at her mother's house in New York during that period, and that her bank account had not been transferred to Canada until the end of 1977. As well, the Tribunal noted, Ms Saraffian had stated that, prior to marrying in 1978, she did not have a definite intention of settling in Canada. Her ties to the country were therefore not strong enough to establish residency prior to 1978 in the Tribunal's view.
