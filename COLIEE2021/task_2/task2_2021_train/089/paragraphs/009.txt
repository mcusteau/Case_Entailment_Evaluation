  The record indicates that the outside correlation review was not completed as quickly as planned and, in the result, Dr. Frazee's return to full inspection duties was delayed. An e-mail from the CFIA Regional Director, Freeman Libby, to Dr. Frazee dated May 28, 2003 described the situation as follows: 
 
 
 
 "Scott; This is a follow-up to our conversation this morning. As you are aware management is trying very hard to get some help from the Ontario Area vis-Ã -vis some veterinarians with expertise in red meat (hog) slaughter to come to Larsons to work with you and the staff at Larsens. The main goal of this is to address the 'disposition' issue working towards ensuring consistency in our approach. 
 
 
 
 It is hoped that this will take place early next week. I will advise you as soon as possible when this has been confirmed. 
 
 
 
 Until we get this in place I am asking that you refrain from working the kill floor. I want to re-emphasize with you that in no way is this viewed as 'disciplinary' action by management. By remaining off the kill floor it allows the Agency time to address the issue in a manner that I described to you during our calls. 
 
 
 
 I want to thank you for your cooperation and I want to reiterate that I am committed to getting this issue resolved ASAP."
