 [48] 
  For these reasons, I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the defendant provided a false blood sample to the R.C.M.P. This constituted the making of a false representation to, and the knowing concealment of a material circumstance from, the R.C.M.P. The false representation was that the blood sample was that of the defendant. The defendant knowingly concealed the material circumstance that it was someone else's blood contained in a rubber tube inserted in his arm under his skin. Through the making of this false representation and/or the knowing concealment of a material circumstance, the defendant circumvented any further police inquiry which would likely have led to criminal charges. This, in turn, would have rendered him ineligible for citizenship. Through the making of the false representation and/or the knowing concealment he was able to tell the Citizenship Judge that he had not been charged with an offence.
