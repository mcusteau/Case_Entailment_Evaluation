  In Salhany on  
 Canadian Criminal Procedure 
  (6th Edition) (looseleaf), at paragraph 3.680 the learned author writes: 
 
 
 
 "3.680 In Canada, the prosecution of someone accused of a criminal offence is generally initiated by the laying of an information before a justice of the peace. Anyone who, on reasonable grounds, believes that a person has committed an indictable offence may lay an information in writing and under oath before the justice. The expression 'to lay an information' means essentially no more that to present an accusation in writing before a justice of the peace (i.e., to lay the information before him) for his signature."
