 [16] 
  While I have concluded that the decision in  
 Obodzinsky 
  does not prohibit a motion for summary judgment on a reference, I take the decision to sound a cautionary note. At the least, the order sought on summary judgment must be consistent with the nature of the reference under subsection 18(1). In the present case, I find that condition to be met. The relief sought on the motion for summary judgment is a declaration on the subject matter of the reference. The motion for summary judgment has also been brought on a timely basis, before the reference itself has been set for hearing, as required by rule 213(1).
