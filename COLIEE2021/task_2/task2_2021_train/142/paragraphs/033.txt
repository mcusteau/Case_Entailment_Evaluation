  Three months before that date, on November 6, 1992, the defendant became aware of the allegations made against him by the victim of the sexual assault he had committed. The defendant's evidence of what he did as a result of his knowledge of the complaint and investigation is important. The defendant, in his affidavit filed in opposition to this motion, swears that: 
 
 
 
 "5. I was first made aware of the allegations against me on November 6, 1992. I was interviewed by the R.C.M.P. on November 9, 1992, in the presence of my counsel, Brad Hunter. At the time, I denied my involvement in the offences. I did not want to be convicted of the offences and I was not willing to accept responsibility for the offences at that time. I now accept responsibility for my actions. 
 
 
 
 "6. I also attempted to clear myself of the allegations by providing a false blood sample to the police. This was an offence of attempting to obstruct the course of justice by providing false evidence contrary to section 139(2) of the  
 Criminal Code 
 . 
 
 
 
 "7. My goal at the time was to avoid prosecution for the offences that occurred on October 31, 1992. I would not have provided a sample of my own blood at that time because I knew that it would incriminate me."
