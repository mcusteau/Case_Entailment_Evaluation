  In my view, there is no evidentiary foundation for this argument. There is no evidence that Sgt. Haanstra required the consent of Crown counsel to charge the defendant. The evidence is only that Sgt. Haanstra called Crown counsel to see if there was any objection to a charge being laid. The only evidence of a basis for objection on the part of Crown counsel is the agreement that he made with the defendant's counsel not to charge the defendant until the DNA test results were received. This agreement was made only as a result of the provision of the false blood sample by the defendant, which the defendant gave only because he knew it would not incriminate him.
