Counsel for the plaintiffs argues, on the other hand, that there is no rational basis for treating patent rights differently from other intellectual property rights, or indeed from other types of cases in which interlocutory injunctions are sought and granted. He argues that to refuse to grant interlocutory injunctions in patent cases effectively encourages piracy of patent rights since an infringing defendant is given, by that refusal, a compulsory licence to manufacture and market the invention during the life of the litigation - which can sometimes exceed the economic life of the product. In the present case, there is evidence that the economic life of garment bags is approximately five years. I understand "economic life" to refer to the period of time during which one can expect an innovative product to be commercially viable, before being overtaken by another more innovative version of the product. Consideration of the respective arguments with respect to the applicable rules in patent cases will be dealt with under the rubric irreparable harm (balance of convenience).
