There is no textual infringement by the defendant of the plaintiffs' patent. Officers of American Tourister admit that that company took the best features of the plaintiffs' bag in designing its own. At the same time, they attempted not to infringe the plaintiffs' patent. The garment bags being sold by the defendant were purposely "designed around" the plaintiffs' patent. The defendant's garment bags do not have a stiffened lower portion of the interior panel. Instead, a stiffened small divider panel has been inserted inside the bag to serve the same function. This additional insert has garment holding means (straps) on one side for the holding of long garments which are then held in a U-shaped fashion when the bag is closed. The reverse side of the added panel has pockets for items such as shoes.
