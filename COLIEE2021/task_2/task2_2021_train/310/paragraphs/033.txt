As noted above, counsel for the defendant argues that the granting of interlocutory injunctions in patent cases is rare because damages are, in general, an adequate remedy. Counsel's review of the jurisprudence leads him to conclude that exceptions to this general rule exist where: (1) the patent is coming to the end of its life and the courts are quick to prevent infringement operating as an early spring board into the market by a competitor; (2) the validity of the patent and its infringement has already been adjudicated (perhaps by a foreign court); (3) the defendant's financial position is insubstantial (a "fly-by night" defendant); (4) the plaintiff and defendant occupy vastly disparate market positions, such that the larger, in the interim, could inflict serious harm on the smaller; (5) the product is not yet on the market and a quia timet injunction is being sought.
