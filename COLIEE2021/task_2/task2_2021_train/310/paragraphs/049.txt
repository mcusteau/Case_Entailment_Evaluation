If the defendant is right, and there is a more or less prima facie rule against issuing interlocutory injunctions in patent cases, then I would consider this case to fall within an exception to that rule. The exception would exist by virtue of the fact that the economic life of the patented product, in this case, is likely to expire well before the issue of the patent's validity and infringement could be finally determined at trial. In any event, I prefer to adopt an analysis which does not rely on any such presumption. In my view, it would be appropriate to grant an interlocutory injunction in this case if the requirements for doing so were otherwise met.
