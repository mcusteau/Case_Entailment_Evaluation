As with all applications for interlocutory injunctions, the argument focuses around three issues: the strength of the plaintiffs' case; the degree of harm which will arise from the withholding or granting of an injunction (irreparable harm); the balance of convenience as between the parties which the granting or withholding of an injunction will create. In addition, argument was addressed to the fact that interlocutory injunctions are granted to preserve the status quo as well as to equitable considerations (in this case, whether there had been delay in seeking the interlocutory injunction).
