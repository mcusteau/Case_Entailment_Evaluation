In the Varta case, the patent related to a method to effect the electrical connection of adjoining cells in a storage battery and to seal the aperture in the partition between the cells with the connecting material. The main difference between the patented connection method and the defendant's method was that in the former the metal to seal the aperture came from projections on the connector lugs and in the latter, the metal necessary to fill the aperture was provided by squeezing the lugs. Otherwise, the two methods were identical.
