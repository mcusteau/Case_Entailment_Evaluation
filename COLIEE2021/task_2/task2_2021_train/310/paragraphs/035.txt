In addition to the higher rate of return that might be charged in the absence of competition by an infringing product, the holder of a patent also loses the access to increased market share and other similar spinoffs which the exercise of the monopoly right would otherwise give him. In the present case, for example, the simultaneous or future purchases of matching pieces of luggage is one such non-quantifiable loss. In addition, the inventor-manufacturer's reputation as an innovator in the market place is undercut by the infringement even though such infringement be temporary in nature. And, the infringer free loads on the innovator's research and development costs. The market edge gained from innovation which is lost as a result of an unimpeded infringement is not easily quantifiable.
