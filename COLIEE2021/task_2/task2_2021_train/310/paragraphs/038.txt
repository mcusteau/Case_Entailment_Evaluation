Counsel for the defendant's main argument, however, is not based on the adequacy of damages as a remedy for the plaintiffs. They are not adequate. Rather, the argument is based on the comparative ease of calculation as between the plaintiff and the defendant, with respect to damages suffered, if the interlocutory injunction should turn out to have been erroneously given. The defendant argues that plaintiffs' losses would be at least partly quantifiable. There would be at least a beginning point from which to try to assess such damages (i.e. the defendant's sales of the infringing product). At the same time, it is argued that the damages the defendant might suffer, if an injunction were erroneously given, would be far more difficult to calculate. Counsel argues: "you cannot quantify what did not happen". Or, in other words, the balance of convenience dictates that an interlocutory injunction not be given.
