The plaintiff, Samsonite Canada, and the defendant, Holiday, are equally strong in the Canadian market place [see footnote 2]. Thus, the granting or withholding of an injunction, in this case, is not likely to have an irreparably destructive effect on either. Both can pay any damages that might arise out of a final determination at trial. Both purchase their respective garment bags from the Orient; thus, no dislocation of a local work force would result from the granting or withholding of an injunction. The defendant's garment bag is not inferior in quality to the plaintiffs' (although the plaintiffs point out that in the absence of an injunction they will have no control over this factor).
