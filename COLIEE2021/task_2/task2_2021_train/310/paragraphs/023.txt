As noted above, there are two garment bags which are alleged to infringe the plaintiffs' patent. These are Holiday's "Jetliner", the "Ultimate" garment bag, and American Tourister's "The Organizer". The divider type panel which has been added is connected in the "Ultimate" bag to the lower front seam, that is, to the seam between the interior panel and the bottom gusset. The divider type panel which has been added to "The Organizer", is connected to the lower back seam, that is, the seam between the exterior panel and the bottom gusset. As between the "Ultimate" and the plaintiffs' "The World's Greatest Garment Bag", there is less functional difference than is the case as between "The Organizer" and the plaintiffs' bag. In fact, if one stapled the extra panel, which has been inserted into the "Ultimate" bag, to the front interior panel of that bag, there would be a textual infringement of the plaintiffs' patent. But the panel, when in use is, of course, not so stapled. In the case of "The Organizer", the functional difference between it and the plaintiffs' garment bag is that long garments never touch the bottom gusset of "The Organizer" (in the plaintiffs', "The World's Greatest Garment Bags", they do so). The extra divider panel in "The Organizer" bag, being connected to the back seam of the bag, keeps long garments from ever touching the bottom gusset. While the plaintiff clearly seeks an injunction to prevent the marketing of both the "Ultimate" and "The Organizer", counsel for both parties indicated that the defendant had given notice that it, in any event, was going to cease manufacturing and marketing the "Ultimate".
