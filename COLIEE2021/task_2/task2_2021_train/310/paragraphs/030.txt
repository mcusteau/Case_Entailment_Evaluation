In the present case, while the same purpose is served by the two garment bags, it seems to me that they accomplish that purpose in materially different ways. As counsel for the defendant argued, they can only be said to be functional equivalents if function is expressed at a very general level. The plaintiffs' garment bag and patent provides for the prevention of bunching by the stiffening of the interior panel, by the attachment of garment holding means to the interior panel. The defendant's garment bags accomplish the purpose of preventing bunching by adding an additional panel to the interior of the bag. That panel serves the purpose, not only of having the garment holding means attached to it, but also of providing pockets for shoes and other comparable items (on the reverse side of the panel). Also, the text of the plaintiffs' patent does not indicate to me that there was an intention to "fence off" a broad spectrum of functional equivalents. The patent is specifically addressed to garment holding means added to the
interior panel
and to the stiffening of the
interior panel
. I think it likely that the defendant's addition of a small interior divider panel, for the purpose of accomplishing the same function, would be said to fall outside the monopoly claimed.
