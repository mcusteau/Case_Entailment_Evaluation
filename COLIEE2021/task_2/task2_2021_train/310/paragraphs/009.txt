It is, of course, trite law that the court, on an interlocutory injunction application, does not determine the merits of the dispute; such determination is for the trial judge. At the same time, it has to be frankly recognized that, as a practical matter, in many intellectual property cases, the interlocutory stage
is
determinative. This arises because some issues, such as the existence or not of copying, are matters determined by "the eye of the court", for which detailed evidence is not usually of much assistance. Also, the issuing or not of interlocutory injunctions (in this court, at least) is determined on motion supported by extensive affidavits on which full cross-examination has been allowed. In many cases, the evidence before the court on such motions is not greatly different from that which would be adduced at trial. (This may be different from the summary procedure followed in some other courts where such full examination of the evidence is not available at an interlocutory stage).
