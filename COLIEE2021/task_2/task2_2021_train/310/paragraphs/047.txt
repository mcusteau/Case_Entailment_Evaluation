In my view, the prior art which was before the patent examiner is relevant to the rebuttability of the presumption of validity. This is not a matter of the construction of the claims per se, on which issue the law is clear that the patent file is not relevant. However, to support the relevance of the files, for the purpose of proving what prior art was and what was not before the patent examiner, it seems to me there would have to be some evidence, attesting to the fact that all patents which had been considered by the examiner were indeed referred to in the file or were likely to have been referred to in the file. Without some such assurance or attestation, I do not see how the documents can support the conclusions purported to be drawn therefrom. What is more, in this case, the evidence, even if admissible, would carry little weight. While claims 28 to 31 of the patent were originally disallowed by the United States examiner, on reconsideration, they were allowed. Thus, the evidence carries little weight to demonstrate the conclusion sought to be drawn; subsequent events contradict that very conclusion. In my view, the evidence issue can be disposed of in this case by indicating that even if technically admissible, it carries little weight.
