The defendant's argument, that claim 28 is anticipated and claims 28 to 31 are obvious, relies particularly on three of the prior art patents: U.S. patent no. 2,596,412 (Kish); U.S. patent no. 3,164,231 (Krynoski); U.S. patent no. 2,740,506 (Davis). The Kish patent issued in 1952 and contained an apron the full length of the flap (interior panel). This enclosed long garments to facilitate their packing. The upper end of this apron was stiffened by a metal bar to provide a well defined fold line for the middle of the garments. But there was no focus on trying to prevent long garments from bunching at the bottom of the bag by securing them to the lower portion of the interior panel. There was no mechanism suggested for holding the garments in place once the bag was closed and folded. Rather, the concept embodied in the Kish patent seems to be designed to ensure that the long garments would be folded in four when the bag was closed in a folded position; and, a boxed space at the bottom would thereby be freed for shoes and other such articles. I do not think that this patent is likely to be held to anticipate the plaintiffs' patent.
