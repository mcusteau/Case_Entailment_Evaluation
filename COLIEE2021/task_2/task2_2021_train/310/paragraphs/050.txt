The fact that doubt exists with respect to establishment of the plaintiffs' case, and the fact that it will be comparatively easier to calculate damages which the plaintiffs might suffer, should an interlocutory injunction be wrongly refused, than it would be to calculate the damages the defendant might suffer if the injunction were wrongly given, lead me to conclude that the order sought should not be granted.
Application dismissed.
