 [28] 
  Although neither party presented any evidence as to what would normally consist of a reasonable delay in the PR application process for the federal skilled worker class, in  
 Liang 
 , above (at para 29), this Court found that 6 to 12 months was a reasonable delay within which such applicants could expect to receive a decision from CIC under MI-1. The Agent's decision falls well within this range. The Court therefore finds that the first part of the test set out in  
 Liang 
  has not been established; the delay in question was not longer than the nature of the process required. (The Court recognizes that the delays set out in  
 Liang 
  were in regard to cases processed under MI-1; however, it finds that a similar characterization of "reasonable delay" would be found under MI-2; notably in light of its objective to further restrain the growth of applications and allow CIC to clear its backlog).
