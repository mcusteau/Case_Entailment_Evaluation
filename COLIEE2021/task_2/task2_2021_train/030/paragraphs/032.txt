  The Global Case Management System (GCMS) notes recorded by the Agent, on July 18, 2011, make explicit reference to the PR applications being returned to the Applicants by regular mail, which is standard CIC practice. There is also no dispute as to whether the immigration consultant's address on file was correct. Moreover, the evidence on the record indicates that the decision letters were successfully delivered to the immigration consultant's address in Dubai; however, they were all returned to CIC by the Dubai postal service as "unclaimed" by the addressee in January 2012 (see Exhibits EE-QQ, Affidavit of Catherine F. Brown).
