, a member of the Armed Forces ("the member") had submitted an application for redress of grievance following the issuance of a counselling and probation caution of six months by the Commander, Fourth Maritime Operations Group, D.E. Collinson. The member's application for redress was examined by the Commander, Maritime Forces Pacific, Rear Admiral Johnston who advised the member that he did not support the application. As a result, the member commenced judicial review proceedings in the Trial Division of this court seeking to set aside Rear Admiral Johnston's decision. The Department of Justice, acting on behalf of the Armed Forces, brought an application to strike the judicial review proceedings on the ground, inter alia, that the member had available to him an adequate alternative remedy which he had not exhausted, namely the submission of his application for redress of grievance to the Commander, Maritime Command, as provided at art. 19.26(7) of the
Q.R.&O.
