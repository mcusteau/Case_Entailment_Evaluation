The application to strike the judicial review proceedings was dismissed by the trial judge whose decision is reported at (1996), 103 F.T.R. 27. In dismissing the application to strike, the trial judge stated at 36 that:
"[21] If the applicant continued to push his grievance up to the CDS and the Minister, the recourse to judicial review would be premature at this stage. However, by seeking judicial review at this stage, the applicant has quite naturally notified the respondents that he opts not to expend the time, resources, money and nervous stress to push up through the chain of command. Believing that the initial impugned decision was and is illegal, the applicant wastes no more of the above, but attacks that decision as soon as he discovers that the first level of authority declines to support the grievance, or in other cases the first time a higher authority so declines."
