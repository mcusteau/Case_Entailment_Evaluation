The respondent's position is simple. He relies on paragraph 13 of CFAO-15-7 which clearly states that where a member of the Armed Forces incurs more than one period of obligatory service, the total obligatory period of service is the sum of all periods incurred. Paragraph 13 goes on to provide that the total period is to be served "commencing the day the second period of training is completed".
