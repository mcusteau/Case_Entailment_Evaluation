[15]
By letter dated March 11, 1996, the Senior Assistant-Deputy Minister, Lieutenant General Fischer, denied the applicant's application for redress of grievance. Lieutenant General Fischer advised the applicant that, should he not be satisfied with his decision, he could request through the normal chain of command that his application for redress be forwarded to the Chief of the Defence Staff. As I indicated earlier, the applicant did not ask that his application for redress be forwarded to the Chief of Defence Staff.
