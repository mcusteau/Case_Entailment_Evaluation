I now turn to the issues. The first issue is whether Lieutenant General Fischer's interpretation of FRP-96 and CFAO-15-7 is correct. The applicant argues that Lieutenant General Fischer's interpretation was wrong and that his outstanding obligatory months of service should have been waived.
The respondent, obviously, is in agreement with Lieutenant General Fischer's interpretation.
