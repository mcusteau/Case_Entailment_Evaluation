On December 7, 1995, the applicant applied under FRP 96 for release from the Armed Forces.
By his decision, Lieutenant General Fisher dismissed the applicant's application for release. This decision, which the applicant seeks to set aside, reads as follows:
"1. I have personally reviewed your application for redress of grievance in which you request that your Force Reduction Plan (FRP) application be accepted unconditionally. You believe that you have served your Obligatory Service (OS) for Post Graduate training in view of the fact that FRP 96 waives the OS requirements for Undergraduate Training for your Military Occupation.
"2. As a result of reviewing all the appropriate documentation, including your rebuttal at Reference B to the briefing note, I believe that your interpretation of current policy is incorrect. I am satisfied that the periods of OS must be served consecutively and that the logical order is that the OS for Undergraduate Training must be served first followed immediately by the OS for incurred for Post Gradate [sic] Training. It is also clear to me that you are not permitted to substitute one period of OS for another. Correspondence at References D and E are very valid in that they provide clarification to current policy and apply to everyone.
"3. I do not believe that you have been treated unfairly or have suffered any injustice. Therefore, I do not support your request for redress.
"4. Should you not be satisfied with this response, you may request, through your normal chain of command, that your request be forwarded to the next higher level of adjudication, the Chief of the Defence Staff."
