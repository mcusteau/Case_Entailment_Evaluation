The public evidence on Mr. Zündel, it must be stated, might not be sufficient to determine that he is a threat to the security of Canada. The fact that his publications are found among other items seized when police raid violent, extremist groups, is also not sufficient. Mr. Christie rightly denounced the rational fallacy found in the Ministers' memorandum - extremists read Mr. Zündel's publications, and commit violent acts, and therefore a link should be found between the two.
