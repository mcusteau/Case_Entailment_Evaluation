Before giving my reasons, I wish to state that the issue of the reasonableness of the certificate still has to be ruled upon, and that the instant decision does not decide the matter. For the time being, I wish to be prudent, and sufficient information has been shown to me to support the idea that the Ministers "have reasonable grounds to believe that the permanent resident is a danger to national security". The determination as to whether the certificate is reasonable will be for another day.
