The Supreme Court of Canada defined in
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3; 281 N.R. 1, at para. 90, what constitutes "danger to the security of Canada":
"... a person constitutes a 'danger to the security of Canada' if he or she poses a serious threat to the security of Canada, whether direct or indirect, and bearing in mind the fact that the security of one country is often dependent on the security of other nations. The threat must be 'serious', in the sense that it must be grounded on objectively reasonable suspicion based on evidence and in the sense that the threatened harm must be substantial rather than negligible."
