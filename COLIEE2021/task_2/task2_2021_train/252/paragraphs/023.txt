Mr. Zündel was questioned about a number of people who are part of dangerous and violent movements, here and abroad, and in every instance, he characterized the relationship as basically superficial, transient, without consequence, and with no funding involved. There is too much evidence to ignore what is obvious. What I have seen in camera, and what I heard in Court from Mr. Zündel, are completely at odds. Mr. Zündel wields much more power within the right-wing, extremist and violent movement known as the White Supremacist Movement (however defined, the only concern for me being the danger it represents to society) than he lets on. He would have us believe that he is only interested in ideas, and that others use his ideas as they see fit, a situation for which he cannot be responsible.
