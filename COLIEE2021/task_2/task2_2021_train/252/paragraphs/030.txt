It is obvious that Mr. Zündel has provided a pale reflection of the real relationship he has had for decades with the individuals named above and others identified in the documents filed as evidence by the Ministers, individuals who have been involved in violent, criminal activities. One finds in their words and actions always present a common thread: hatred of Jews, hatred of nonwhite minorities, a claim that Whites are threatened by our multicultural society. Mr. Zündel may deny that he advocates violence, but he cannot deny that he espouses the same ideas as extremist violent groups. The information provided in camera by the Ministers to this Court goes further: Mr. Zündel in many cases pulls the strings that lead to violent actions.
