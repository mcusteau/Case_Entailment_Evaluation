  I have considered the Minister's submission that the CRDD answered the only relevant question to be determined, which was whether there was a serious possibility that Mr. Tolu would be persecuted if returned to Turkey. However, I am not satisfied that the CRDD would have reached that conclusion had it properly considered the evidence before it.
