  In 1988, Mr. Tolu's family moved to Istanbul from the village of Kantarma hoping to escape the pressure they had faced there as Alevi Kurds. In 1991, Mr. Tolu and his father were arrested by security agents who were looking for what was characterized as separatist propaganda. They were detained for two days, given very little food or drink, questioned at length, and beaten. Mr. Tolu saw his father subjected to electric shocks.
