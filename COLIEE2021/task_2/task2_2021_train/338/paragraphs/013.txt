I find no basis for a conclusion that the respondent's
Charter
rights were violated. While reference was made in material before the court on behalf of the respondent to both ss. 7 and 11 of the
Charter
, any argument based upon s. 11 can, I conclude, be summarily dismissed. In
R. v. Wigglesworth
, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 541; 81 N.R. 161; 61 Sask.R. 105; 24 O.A.C. 321; 45 D.L.R.(3d) 235; [1988] 1 W.W.R. 193; 60 C.R.(3d) 193; 28 Admin. L.R. 294; 32 C.R.R. 219; 37 C.C.C.(3d) 385, Madame Justice Wilson wrote at p. 558 S.C.R.:
"... It is, in my view, preferable to restrict s. 11 to the most serious offenses known to our law, i.e., criminal and penal matters and to leave other 'offenses' subject to the more flexible criteria of 'fundamental justice' in s. 7."
