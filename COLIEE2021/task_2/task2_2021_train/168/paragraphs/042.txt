  I think the answer to this objection is that it is up to Parliament to define how certain categories of non-citizens will be dealt with in terms of a right of non-refoulement. Convention refugees must not be refouled because Canada has signed the Refugee Convention, and likewise, those in danger of torture cannot be refouled because of Canada's commitments under the Convention Against Torture. There is no such obligation with respect to mandate refugees. In any case, mandate refugees are only declared refugees for the purpose of allowing the UNHCR to provide help. Once the mandate refugee has been resettled, the UNHCR's mandate no longer applies to that person.
