  Mr. Kim submits that two important pieces of evidence were ignored. First, the officer failed to recognize the significance of reports that some of the U.S. deportees who are kept in detention pending release into the wider Cambodian community are supplied with food by their Cambodian relatives, and failed to deal with published allegations that Cambodia does not have the resources to support returnees. He submits that as he has no relatives in Cambodia, he will not have the necessaries of life. Second, and more significantly, Mr. Kim cites a reported statement by the Prime Minister of Cambodia to the effect that he does not want criminals returned and that they would be imprisoned in Prey Sar, a notorious prison in which, allegedly, the risk of torture is high.
