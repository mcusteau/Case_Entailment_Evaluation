  In addition, though this was not argued by the applicant, I found it strange that the PRRA officer's decision made no reference to the part of Mr. Kim's application letter where he described horrific treatment - likely amounting to torture - by the police when he was just five years old (Tribunal Record at 47-48). Again, however, I do not believe that this amounts to reviewable error, considering the finding that there was no evidence that Mr. Kim is now of any interest to the government or police of Cambodia.
