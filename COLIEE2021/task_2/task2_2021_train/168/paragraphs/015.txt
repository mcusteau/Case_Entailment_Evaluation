  The expertise of the PRRA officer is variable, depending on the nature of the question considered. With respect to country conditions, PRRA officers can be said to have extensive expertise. They are required to do research to assess the level of protection and other country conditions for each application. As noted in the  
 Citizenship and Immigration Canada Manual 
  for PRRA officers, PP-03 "Pre-removal Risk Assessment (PPRA)" at 11.02, "One of the implicit assumptions about PRRA is that the PRRA decision-maker will become, over time and through experience, very knowledgeable on many countries." As such, a significant degree of deference should be given to conclusions on country conditions. Furthermore, with respect to other facts necessary to complete the assessment, the Court is in no better position than the PRRA officer, and if an oral interview is conducted, is arguably in a worse position to determine the facts. A high degree of deference should be shown to this sort of expertise.
