 [74] 
  In my view, the applicant's suggested question is too broad, while the respondent's is too narrow to be of general application. However, the two questions phrased as follows would raise questions of law of general application whose answers would be determinative of this appeal: 
 
 
 
 1. What legal effect, if any, has a designation of by the UNHCR as a "mandate refugee" on the determination of whether an individual is a protected person under ss. 95, 112, and 115? 
 
 
 
 2. What legal effect, if any, does a successful application for permanent residence under the former  
 Indochinese Designated Class Regulations 
  have upon a determination of whether an individual is a protected person under ss. 95, 112, and 115? 
 
 
 
 These are question of law, the result of which would have an impact beyond the facts of this case. The status of mandate refugees within the  
 IRPA 
  scheme is a question that warrants scrutiny, as is the question of the legal position occupied by persons admitted to Canada as part of the Indochinese designated class.
