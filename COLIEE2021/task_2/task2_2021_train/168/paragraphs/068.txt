 [69] 
  In  
 Correia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) 
  (2004), 253 F.T.R. 153 (F.C.), Justice Phelan found that an immigration officer need not consider humanitarian and compassionate factors prior to making a report pursuant to ss. 36(1) and 44(1) of  
 IRPA 
 . In particular, he focussed on the low level of discretion accorded to immigration officers under  
 IRPA 
  in making decisions regarding serious criminality and the limited nature of the inquiry.
