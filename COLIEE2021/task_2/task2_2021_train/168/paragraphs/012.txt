  The purpose of requiring a PRRA analysis is ultimately to honour Canada's international obligations under the  
 Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment 
 . Given this specific context, I find that two purposes under paragraphs 3(2)(d) and (e) above are particularly engaged in the "risk assessment" portion of a PRRA decision: to offer safe haven to persons at risk of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, as well as upholding Canada's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings.
