  As a preliminary matter, Mr. Kim objects to the admissibility of the affidavit of John R. Butt, an immigration official, on the ground that it contains legal argument. In my view, the affidavit explains the historical state and evolution of immigration policy, practices, and programs from the early 1970s onward. The statements do not contain legal argument, but statements about what Mr. Butt understood the state of the law to have been at various points in time. I am alive to the fact that Mr. Butt is one immigration official among many, and that he is simply expressing his opinion and understanding of the relevant facts. The applicant's concerns would have been better addressed by means of a cross-examination on the affidavit (which was not performed), rather than by its exclusion. The affidavit is accepted as filed.
