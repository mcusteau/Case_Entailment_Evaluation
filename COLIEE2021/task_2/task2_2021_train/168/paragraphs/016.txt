  By contrast, the PRRA officers do not have the same level of expertise regarding questions of law as does this Court. While the officer receives training on the relevant law, he or she need not have a general legal background, and likely has familiarity with only the  
 IRPA 
  and  
 IRP Regulations 
  as they relate to his or her functions. A higher degree of deference is necessary only when the decision-making body has, in some way, a greater expertise than the reviewing court and the particular issue pertains to this greater expertise:  
 Conseil de la magistrature (N.-B.) v. Moreau-Bérubé 
 , [2002] 1 S.C.R. 249; 281 N.R. 201; 245 N.B.R.(2d) 201; 636 A.P.R. 201, at para. 50. This is not the case here. In my view, very little deference ought to be shown to the expertise of PRRA officers on such legal questions as determination of jurisdiction or interpretation of the relevant law. Finally, as discussed below, I do not find that an exercise of discretion is relevant to any aspect of a PRRA decision, so no additional deference needs to be accorded to the decision-maker on that account.
