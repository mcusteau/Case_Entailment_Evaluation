  When it comes to the application of the law to the facts, the PRRA officer has some training and experience, but not the same level of expertise as a Court. Particularly, for those questions of mixed fact and law in which the officer is dealing with law outside his or her training and everyday experience, little deference should be shown. Somewhat more deference should nonetheless be shown in cases where the PRRA officer is dealing with questions of mixed fact and law for which they can be expected to have some knowledge, training, and experience, such as the application of the legal definition of protected person to the facts of a given case.
