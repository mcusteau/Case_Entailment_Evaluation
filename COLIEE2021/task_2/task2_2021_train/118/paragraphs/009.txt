  While it is clear that to give, means something other than to consent, what does it mean under Hindu law? The Appeal Division did have before it a decision of the Supreme Court of India which, while not dealing specifically with the giving and taking of a child in an adoption ceremony, did provide them with some guidance regarding the nature of adoption under Hindu Law:  
 Dei v. Mohanta 
  (1993), 28 H.L.R. 366. The Minister, in arguing the adoption in this instance was void under  
 HAMA 
 , relies only on its interpretation of the provisions of  
 HAMA 
  and provided no other jurisprudence regarding the requirements and interpretation of  
 HAMA 
  by the Indian courts.
