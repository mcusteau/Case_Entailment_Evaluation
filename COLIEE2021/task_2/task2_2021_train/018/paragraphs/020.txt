  The Board also relied on the fact that state police forces are separate and distinct and that there was no reason to think that a person such as the applicant, who was not on an official "wanted" list, would face the same kind of problems from members of police forces outside the federal district. However, the applicant's evidence that he had seen outside the house in Toluca cars with tinted windows similar to those often used by police forces was not contradicted. This indicates that the Board may have been mistaken in concluding that a law abiding citizen in Mexico who has been beaten, threatened and otherwise harassed for resisting the demands of corrupt officials by members of one police force has nothing to fear from members of other forces. On the other hand, it should also be noted that the fact that the applicant had been traced by the police to Toluca, which is in the state of Mexico and no more than approximately a hundred miles from Mexico City, does not necessarily prove that he would not be safe if he were to relocate much further away from the capital. Mexico, as counsel for the respondent reminded me, is a very large country, and the applicant's name is not in the national law enforcement computer records.
