  Even more recently, the Federal Court of Appeal was again asked to answer a certified question with respect to state protection, in the context of a refugee claim based on spousal violence ( 
 The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration 
  v.  
 Carrillo 
 , 2008 FCA 94). Writing for the Court, Justice LÃ©tourneau first mentioned that an applicant bears both an evidentiary and a legal burden. In other words, the applicant must not only introduce evidence of inadequate state protection (the evidentiary burden), but must also convince the trier of fact that the evidence adduced establishes the inadequacy of the state protection (the legal burden). While the burden of proof is the usual balance of probabilities standard applicable to rebuttals of presumption in administrative and civil matters, the quality of the evidence adduced to meet that burden will have to be of a high standard if, as stated in  
 Ward 
 , the "presumption serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the claimant" (at par. 51). Accordingly, the evidence adduced will not only have to be reliable, but also have probative value.
