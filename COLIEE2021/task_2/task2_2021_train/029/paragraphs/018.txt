  The standard of review applicable to issues of state protection has been determined by this Court to be reasonableness: see  
 Chaves 
  v.  
 Canada (MCI) 
 , 2005 FC 193, 45 Imm. L.R. (3d) 58. This standard has been confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in  
 Hinzman 
  v.  
 Canada (MCI) 
 , 2007 FCA 171, at par. 38, 282 D.L.R. (4th) 413 ( 
 Hinzman 
 ) and has not been modified by the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Dunsmuir 
  v.  
 New Brunswick 
 , 2008 SCC 9, 164 A.C.W.S. (3d) 727 ( 
 Dunsmuir 
 ). The adequacy of state protection raises questions of mixed fact and law, and must therefore attract a good measure of deference. A reviewing court will not intervene if the decision falls "within a range of acceptable outcomes, which are defensible in respect of the facts and law": see  
 Dunsmuir 
  at par. 47.
