  The issue of state protection has been canvassed on a number of occasions by this Court and by the Federal Court of Appeal, as well as by the Supreme Court of Canada in  
 Canada (A.G.) 
  v.  
 Ward 
 , [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689 (QL) ( 
 Ward 
 ). Absent a situation of complete breakdown of the state apparatus, there is a presumption that a state is able to protect its citizens. To rebut this presumption, an applicant must adduce clear and convincing evidence of the state's inability to protect him or her. My colleague Justice Layden-Stevenson aptly summarized the applicable principles in  
 B.R. v. Canada (MCI) 
 , 2006 FC 269, at par. 20, 53 Imm. L.R. (3d) 229: 
 
 
 
 Absent a situation of complete breakdown of state apparatus, it is generally presumed that a state is able to protect its citizens. This presumption serves to reinforce the underlying rationale of international protection as a surrogate, coming into play where no alternative remains to the claimant. Refugee claimants must present clear and convincing confirmation of a state's inability to protect them in order to rebut the presumption that states are capable of protecting their citizens:  
 Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward, 
  [1993] 2 S.C.R. 689. State protection cannot be held to a standard of perfection but it must be adequate. It is not enough to show that a government has not always been effective in protecting persons in a claimant's particular situation. However, where the state is so weak and its control is so tenuous as to make it a government in name only, it may be justifiable to claim an inability to obtain state protection:  
 Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Villafranca 
  (1992), 99 D.L.R. (4th) 334 (F.C.A.) leave to appeal dismissed, [1993] S.C.C.A. No. 76.
