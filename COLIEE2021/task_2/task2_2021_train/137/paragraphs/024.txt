  Since Mr Fabbiano heard nothing until 2013 about his potential inadmissibility after having made submissions in 2007, he reasonably believed that officials were no longer pursuing the issue, and was obviously surprised when he received the 2013 decision. There was nothing that would have suggested to him that he ought to file supplementary submissions. This was not an application on his part, in respect of which he might have had an obligation to inform the decision-maker of any additional information. He was being pursued by the respondents.
