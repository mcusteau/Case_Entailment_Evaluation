  Abuse of process is a common law principle permitting courts to stop proceedings that have become unfair or oppressive. This includes situations where there has been an unacceptable delay resulting in significant prejudice ( 
 Blencoe v British Columbia 
   
 (Human Rights Commission) 
 , [2000] 2 SCR 307, at para 101). A key question is whether the delay "impairs a party's ability to answer the complaint" (at para 102). Alternatively, a court can provide a remedy where the proceedings have become oppressive for other reasons including, for example, where the person carried on with his life reasonably believing that no further action would be taken against him ( 
 Ratzclaff v British Columbia (Medical Services Commission) 
  (1996), BCJ No 36 (BCCA) (QL), at para 23).
