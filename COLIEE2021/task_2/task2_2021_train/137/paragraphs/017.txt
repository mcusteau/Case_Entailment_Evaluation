  There was also evidence about Mr Fabbiano's personal circumstances. In his 2007 submissions, he presented a number of H&C grounds in his favour: 
 
 
 
 • He has lived almost his entire life in Canada, having visited Italy only once when he was 13 years old. He has little or no family in Italy. 
 
 
 
 • He does not speak Italian, and would have trouble finding employment in Italy. 
 
 
 
 • He has four Canadian-born children, two of whom live with him and his common-law spouse. 
 
 
 
 • He has been steadily employed as a carpenter since 1975, and also runs a small glass business. 
 
 
 
 • He has only one criminal conviction for which he served a one-year sentence while living at home. 
 
 
 
 • He has work-related hearing loss and injuries to his hands. 
 
 
 
 • His spouse and one son are both status First Nations members, who would lose their connection with their heritage if they moved with him to Italy. 
 
 
 
 • His daughters both have serious medical challenges, including depression, which would be aggravated by their father's deportation. 
 
 
 
 • His removal from Canada would have a seriously adverse impact on his remaining family members, including his elderly parents who would not be able to visit him in Italy.
