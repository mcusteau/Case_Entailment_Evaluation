  As mentioned, there was evidence before the delegate showing that Mr Fabbiano was associated with the Hells Angels. In particular, according to some members of the RCMP, Mr Fabbiano had been a member of the Hells Angels since 1992 and had been seen on numerous occasions wearing Hells Angels "colours". In fact, Mr Fabbiano acknowledged to the RCMP that he was a member. However, there was no evidence that Mr Fabbiano actually furthered any criminal activities of the Hells Angels.
