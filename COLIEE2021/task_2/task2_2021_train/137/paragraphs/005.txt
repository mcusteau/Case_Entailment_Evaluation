  In my view, the delay in communicating the delegate's decision to Mr Fabbiano constitutes an abuse of process. The delay prejudiced Mr Fabbiano and compromised the integrity of the administration of justice. Accordingly, I must allow this application for judicial review and stay the admissibility proceedings against Mr Fabbiano. It is unnecessary to address the other issues Mr Fabbiano raised.
