  In the circumstances, Mr Fabbiano could reasonably have concluded that his submissions had been persuasive and that he was no longer at risk of removal. Further, at the time the decision was communicated to him, the information underlying it was nearly 7 years old. Undoubtedly, the circumstances of his children and other family members would have evolved during that time period, as would his own situation, including his employment, health and, perhaps, his relationship, if any, with the Hells Angels. In my view, issuing a decision in 2013 relating to his admissibility to Canada based on information gathered in 2007 clearly prejudiced Mr Fabbiano.
