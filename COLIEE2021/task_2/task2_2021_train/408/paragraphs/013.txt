There is a conflict between the affidavit of John Justus Floto and that of John V. Houghton as to whether actual confusion with the plaintiff's product took place in the mind of one David Moir, a British Columbia Liquor Distribution Branch employee. The first affidavit alleges that Mr. Moir said it did. The latter affidavit alleges that Mr. Moir later said that he was not so confused. As both these are hearsay, this evidence could not be assessed great weight. However, due to the two different interpretations, David Moir took the unusual course of making his own affidavit - more about this later.
