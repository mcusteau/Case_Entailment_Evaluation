In general, Canadian courts appear to follow the requirements for granting an interlocutory judgment as set down by the House of Lords in American Cyanamid Co. v. Ethicon Ltd., [1975] A.C. 396, for intellectual property: Syntex Inc. et al v. Apotex Inc. (1984), 1 C.P.R.(3d) 145 (F.C.A.); Halliburton Co. et al v. Northstar Drillstem Testers et al., (1981), 58 C.P.R.(2d) 73; Smith Kline & French Canada Ltd. v. Frank W. Horner Inc. (1982), 68 C.P.R.(2d) 42. Mr. Justice Beetz, however, recently stated in A.G. Manitoba v. Metropolitan Stores et al. (unreported, S.C. No. 19609, March 5, 1987) at page 17: "... it is neither necessary nor advisable to choose, for all purposes, between the traditional formulation and the American Cyanamid description of the first test ...". [See [1987] 1 S.C.R. 110; 73 N.R. 341; 46 Man.R.(2d) 241.] Thus, the "serious question" test as opposed to the "prima facie case" test may not always prevail.
