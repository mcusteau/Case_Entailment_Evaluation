  The applicant has requested costs. Pursuant to Rule 22 of the  
 Federal Court Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules 
 , Can. Reg. 93-22, costs shall not be awarded unless so ordered for special reasons. Special reasons suggests some form of abuse of the Court's process or unfairness to one of the parties. While I have concerns about the manner in which the forfeiture decision was made and apparent lack of attention in the preparation of the manager's affidavit in this case, I am not prepared to make such a finding.
