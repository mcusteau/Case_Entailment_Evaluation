  On March 14, 2005, Ms. Lee went to the Greater Toronto Enforcement Centre (GTEC) and spoke to Officer Peterdy, accompanied by the Pastor of her Church. The following day, March 15, 2005, the applicant, Ms. Kang, also attended the GTEC with the Pastor and spoke with Officer Peterdy. How these interviews were conducted is not clear. Presumably the Pastor served as interpreter. Officer Peterdy took notes which were entered on the FOSS system. The respondent relies on those notes as a contemporaneous record of statements made by the applicant and her mother at these meetings. The accuracy of that record is disputed by the applicant. What is common ground, however, is that Ms. Kang undertook to take steps to ensure that her mother would comply with the outstanding removal order and return to Korea, which she did in April, 2005.
