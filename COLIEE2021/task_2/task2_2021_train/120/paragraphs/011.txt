  In an affidavit submitted for these proceedings, Ms. Gilker deposes that she reviewed the applicant's file and "... as such have knowledge of the matters hereinafter deposed to. Where my statements are based on information and belief, I have so stated". Ms. Gilker's affidavit then proceeds to review the history disclosed by the file without any further indication of what was within her personal knowledge and what was based on information and belief. Ms. Gilker repeats the statements contained in the FOSS notes made by Officer Peterdy, as statements of fact. No mention is made of the contradictory affidavit evidence submitted by the applicant other than as "submissions". Ms. Gilker concludes in paragraph 11: 
 
 
 
 "I considered all of the evidence on file and the Applicant's submissions and determined that Ms. Lee had breached a Condition of Release causing the Applicant's bond to be forfeited."
