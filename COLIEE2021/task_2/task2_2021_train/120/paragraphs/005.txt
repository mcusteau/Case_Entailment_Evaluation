  On March 12, 2005, CBSA Officer J. Atkinson made an early morning visit to 8 Dunstable Place looking for other members of the family who were the subject of warrants and, while there, found that Ms. Lee was not present. A few days later, Atkinson told Officer Mike Peterdy that Ms. Kang said that her mother was not living there. Officer Peterdy entered that statement as a note on the Field Operating Support System ("FOSS"). Ms. Kang's son, Chul Hee Kang, who speaks English, deposes that he interpreted for his mother on the occasion and mistakenly gave the officer wrong information due to confusion over his grandmother's name and that of the other family members being sought.
