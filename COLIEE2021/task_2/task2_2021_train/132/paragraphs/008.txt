  In the present case, the applicants had already had their visas extended twice in order to remain in Canada. Furthermore, their claim for permanent residence status was denied by the Immigration and Refugee Board, and a further extension granted in order to allow the applicants time to make travel arrangements from Canada. Rather than leave, they made a refugee claim which was also denied by the Immigration and Refugee Board, and judicial review was not granted. This current H & C application seems to be a backdoor attempt at remaining in Canada when access through the front door has been denied in accordance with Canadian law. (Mayburov v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] F.C.J. No. 953; Lee v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCT 7, [2001] F.C.J. No. 139)
