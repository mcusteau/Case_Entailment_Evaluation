  As for the applicants' arguments that the officer improperly weighted certain pieces of evidence, I would reaffirm that, as was pointed out in the Agot v. Canada, supra, decision, the weighing of relevant factors is not the function of a court reviewing the exercise of ministerial discretion. Therefore, as long as the totality of the evidence was properly examined, the question of weight remains entirely within the expertise of the immigration officer. On that point, I find that the officer thoroughly reviewed everything that was available to him, acknowledging the claims of the applicant but properly indicating why it was that he did not accept them, for example: 
 
 
 
 The officer acknowledged that the Applicant's establishment in Canada, but noted that this was not a sufficient ground for a positive H & C decision. (Page 6 of the reasons for decision of the officer) 
 
 
 
 Although leaving the Church at which the applicant was a pastor may cause inconvenience to the parish and its members, it would not cause disproportionate hardship as the Church was able to survive with no one heading it between 1993 and 1999, and that it had a retired missionary, two seminary students and numerous persons who helped out in various groups within the Church. (Page 5 of the reasons for decision of the officer) 
 
 
 
 The officer also agreed that the daughters of the applicant were much younger when they came to Canada, but found that they would be able to adjust, seeing as to how they were born in Korea and lived there until 1996. They also have no family in Canada, but have maternal and paternal family members in Korea with whom they remained in contact. Furthermore, they are familiar with the culture and language of that country and attended school there. (Page 5 of the reasons for decision of the officer)
