  The  
 Oceans Act 
 , S.C. 1996, c. 31, heavily relied upon by the applicant, in its preamble, specifies that Canada promotes the wide application of the precautionary approach to the conservation, management and exploitation of marine resources in order to protect these resources and preserve the marine environment and that Canada recognizes that conservation, based on an ecosystem approach, is of fundamental importance. Part II of the  
 Act 
  deals with ocean management strategy and mandates collaboration by the Minister with various stakeholders. The general powers of the Minister include a direction to encourage activities necessary to foster understanding, management and sustainable development of oceans and marine resources. The specific ministerial powers are delineated in s. 43 and are specifically stated to be subject to s. 4 of the  
 Department of Fisheries and Oceans Act 
 . Section 6(1) of the  
 Fishery (General) Regulations 
 , SOR/93-53, enacted pursuant to paragraph 43(m) of the  
 Fisheries Act 
 , provides for the variation of any close time, fishing quota or limit in respect of an area or any portion of that area fixed under any of the  
 Regulations 
 . It would thus appear that the Minister acted within the powers granted to him by law.
