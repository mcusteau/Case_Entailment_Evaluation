  An action taken by the Crown is prima facie deemed to be in the public interest:  
 Tsartlip Indian Band et al. v. Pacific Salmon Foundation et al. 
  (1988), 24 F.T.R. 304 (T.D.). When a private applicant alleges that the public interest is at risk that harm must be demonstrated. This is because private applicants are normally presumed to be pursuing their own interests rather than those of the public at large. In considering the balance of convenience and the public interest, it does not assist an applicant to claim that a given government authority does not represent the public interest. Rather, the applicant must convince the court of the public interest benefits which flow from the granting of the relief sought:
