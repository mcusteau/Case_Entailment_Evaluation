  When a public authority is prevented from exercising its statutory powers, it can be said that the public interest, of which that authority is the guardian, suffers irreparable harm:  
 Canada v. Fishing Vessel Owners' Association of B.C. 
 , [1985] 1 F.C. 791; 61 N.R. 128 (F.C.A.). A court should not, as a general rule, attempt to ascertain whether actual harm would result. To do so would in effect require judicial inquiry into whether the government is governing well, since it implies the possibility that government action does not have the effect of promoting the public interest and that the restraint of the action would therefore not harm the public interest:
