A finding of credibility is a finding of fact. As a result, the Applicant for judicial review bears a heavy burden of proving that the Board's determination is perverse, capricious or without regard to the evidence before it (s. 18.1(4)d), Federal Court of Canada, L.R.C. 1985, c. F-7). It is trite law that this Court will only intervene where the Board's decision is found to be patently unreasonable (Aguebor v. Canada (M.C.I.), (1993) 160 N.R. 315 (F.C.A.)). As Martineau J. wrote in R.K.L. v. Canada (M.C.I.) ([2003] F.C.J. No 162, at par. 7):
"The determination of an applicant's credibility is the heartland of the Board's jurisdiction. This Court has found that the Board has well-established expertise in the determination of questions of fact, particularly in the evaluation of the credibility and the subjective fear of persecution of an applicant: see Rahaman v. Canada (M.C.I.), [2000] F.C.J. No. 1800 at para. 38 (QL) (T.D.); and Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (M.C.I.), (1998), 157 F.T.R. 35 at para. 14."
