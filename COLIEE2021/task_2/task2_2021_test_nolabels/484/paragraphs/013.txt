There are essentially two issues to be determined in the context of this application: 1) Were the Board's adverse credibility findings patently unreasonable, based on erroneous findings of fact or reached without regard to the evidence before it? 2) Did the Board breach the principles of natural justice in not giving the Applicant an opportunity to file any critical information or documents to substantiate the various elements of her claim before reaching its decision?
