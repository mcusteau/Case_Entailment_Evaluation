On the departure from Cameroon, the Board finds a number of problems. First, the Board notes that the applicant claims to have communicated with her mother, during her detention, through notes. The Board notes that this information is not in her PIF. The Board also finds it implausible that the applicant only knew the first name of the pastor who helped her travel to New York and Canada. During her testimony, the applicant remembered the pastor's full name; the Board finds that this selective memory further impugns her credibility.
