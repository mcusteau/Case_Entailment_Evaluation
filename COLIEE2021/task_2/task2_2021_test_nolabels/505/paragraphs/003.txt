The applicant submits that pursuant to procedural fairness there was a duty on the visa officer to inform the applicant of his option to have his spouse assessed in any occupation in which the spouse is qualified for and prepared to follow in Canada. Further the visa officer, it is submitted, is required to assess the spouse in the spouse's intended occupation where there is evidence before the officer indicating the spouse is qualified in the intended occupation.
