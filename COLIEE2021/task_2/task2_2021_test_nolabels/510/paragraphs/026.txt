[26]
The nature of the case to be met is reasonably clear in that the plaintiffs, in pleading that the defendant's
Pneumocort
trademark was not registerable, are looking to s. 12(1)(d) of the
Trade-marks Act
, for that is a section of the
Act
referred to in paragraph 23 of the statement of claim; the paragraphs in the statement of claim leading up to the allegation that the
Pneumocort
trademark was not registerable certainly point to confusion between the two trademarks; s. 12(1)(d) is, by a process of elimination, the only option; and finally, the applicant, in paragraph 13 of written argument on this motion, recognizes that it is in fact the applicable section, before getting into rhetorical speculation as to what the other possibilities might be.
