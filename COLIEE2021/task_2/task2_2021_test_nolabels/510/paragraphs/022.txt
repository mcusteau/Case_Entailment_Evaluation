[22]
Paragraph 21(b) of the statement of claim, taken together with the background information set out in paragraphs 5 through 20, concludes that the defendant's
Pneumocort
trademark was not distinctive, given the confusion that it has caused or is likely to cause with the plaintiffs' trademark. The defendant, in a reply to the plaintiffs' submissions, raises an argument based on the
Trade-marks Act
definition of "distinctive" in s. 2, about adaption of the trademark to distinguish wares, as opposed to actually distinguishing wares: this is something best left to be explored on discovery, or argued at trial.
