In the present instance, counsel for the defendant refers to
P.L.G. Research Ltd. et al. v. Jannock Steel Fabricating Co. et al.
(1991), 46 F.T.R. 25; 35 C.P.R.(3d) 344 (T.D. Prothonotary), a decision in which the Associate Senior Prothonotary, Mr. Giles, ordered particulars, notwithstanding the absence of an affidavit indicating the necessity for particulars, on the common sense basis that the pleadings were deficient on their face, and thus no affidavit evidence was required to substantiate the claim for particulars.
