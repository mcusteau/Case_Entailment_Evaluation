I have also kept in mind that it is improper to make bare assertions of conclusions of law in a pleading. However, they are permissable so long as supported by the material facts on which the conclusions are based: see for example
Société des produits Marnier-Lapostolle v. Rey (René) Swiss Chocolates Ltd.
(1989), 32 F.T.R. 75; 29 C.P.R.(3d) 329 (T.D.), at p. 331.
