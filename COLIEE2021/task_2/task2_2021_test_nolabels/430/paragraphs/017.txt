I am satisfied that Novopharm purchased or acquired, on the 1st of October, 1990, a limited quantity of the invention for which the Patent was afterwards obtained by Merck, within the meaning of s. 56 of the
Patent Act
. Thus, pursuant to that section, Novopharm, before the claim date of the claims in the Patent, had the right to use and sell to others subject of course to the issuance of an appropriate, or more than one appropriate, notice or notices of compliance under the
Regulations
, the limited quantity of the specific composition of matter for which the Patent was afterwards obtained under the
Patent Act
.
