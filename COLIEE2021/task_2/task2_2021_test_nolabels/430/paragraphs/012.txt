Mr. Justice MacGuigan reasoned that, as applied to the facts of this matter, Novopharm could not be said to have "purchased or acquired" the bulk enalapril maleate until it obtained title to it. He continued in his analysis by concluding that title could not pass, once again on the facts of this matter, to Novopharm until the product was in a deliverable state. For ease of reference, I quote again:
"In circumstances where the seller itself thought that the product was unsuitable for delivery, I do not think this court should conclude otherwise."
