I can find no basis on which to conclude that the phrase "Meets specifications" refers other than to the stipulation in Novopharm's purchase order for the bulk enalapril maleate that the product must meet Health Protection Branch requirements. If I am wrong in this and the words "meets specifications" in the Delmar certificate of analysis referred to the bulk enalapril maleate meeting Delmar's specifications as opposed to those of Novopharm and, by incorporation, those of the Health Protection Branch, I still conclude that the words clearly and unequivocally demonstrate that Delmar was, as of the date of the certificate, of the opinion that the bulk enalapril maleate was in a "deliverable state".
