The specified delivery date was the 15th of October, 1990. Under date of the 31st of August, 1990, Delmar produced a "certificate of analysis" with respect to enalapril maleate indicating that it "meets specifications". It is of note that the certificate of analysis pre-dates the purchase order but there was no dispute before me that the certificate of analysis was applicable with respect to the enalapril maleate eventually delivered to Novopharm.
