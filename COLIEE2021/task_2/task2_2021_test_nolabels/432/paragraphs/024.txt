[24]
Upon considering the additional evidence filed before this court together with the evidence filed before the Registrar, and upon looking at all the relevant surrounding circumstances in the same way as did the Registrar, I am also left in doubt as to whether, at the date of filing of the appellant's application, its proposed trademark VICTOR HUGO & Design was confusing with the respondent's trademark HUGO BOSS. As a result, like the Registrar, I have concluded that the appellant has filed to meet the onus or burden upon it of establishing that there existed at the material date no likelihood of such confusion and that he then was the person entitled to registration pursuant to s. 16(3) of the
Act
, which is sufficient to dismiss the present appeal.
