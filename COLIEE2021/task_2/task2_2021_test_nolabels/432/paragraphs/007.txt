[7]
It is the appellant's first contention that the Registrar erred in law in the test to be applied and the circumstances to be considered when deciding whether there existed any likelihood of confusion between the appellant's proposed trademark VICTOR HUGO & Design and the mark raised by the respondent, namely HUGO BOSS. The appellant's second contention is that based on the additional evidence filed in support of this appeal, when considered in light of the evidence which was before the Registrar, there is no likelihood that confusion would occur in the marketplace as a result of the concurrent use of the trademarks VICTOR HUGO & Design and HUGO BOSS in respect of men's wearing apparel.
