Clarke v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 123 F.T.R. 277 (T.D.), per Wetston, J., which deals with the issue of the necessity for reasons for a decision under s. 70(5) of the
Act
, counsel for the applicant urged in written submissions following the hearing in this case that reasons of the PCDO in a decision concerning membership in the PDRCC class should demonstrate a "risk assessment methodology ... substantially rational and rationally connected to the social-scientific field of risk assessment methodology".
