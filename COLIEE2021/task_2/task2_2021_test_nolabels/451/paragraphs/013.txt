I note that in
Nadarajah
, Rothstein, J., considered the documentary evidence there in question to be from sources available to the public and he referred to the decision of Mr. Justice Rouleau in
Quintanilla v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 105 F.T.R. 315 (T.D.). In the latter case, where documentary evidence of country conditions considered in a PDRCC assessment is material that is publicly available, Rouleau, J., held there was no obligation to inform the applicant, in advance of a decision, of specific documents concerning country conditions that are being considered. That same principle was applied in
Nadarajah
by Rothstein, J., and in my view it is applicable here, at least with reference to documents published and available from public sources prior to the date of any submission by the applicant.
