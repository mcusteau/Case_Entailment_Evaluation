Post hearing submissions of the applicant were extensive, with counsel reviewing two major academic discussions of risk assessment methodology. On the basis of those counsel offered a critique of the risk assessment methodology as that appears or is inferred from the draft manual. I expect that submission should be of interest to policy, planning and training officers of the respondent. From my perspective, it does not concentrate on the matter raised at the hearing, that is, the significance of any failure to disclose in advance of the PCDO's decision in this case, the methodology of risk assessment followed in determination of claims to be included in the PDRCC class. The post hearing submission does note that in the draft manual emphasis is placed on the duty to disclose information or evidence to be relied upon by a PCDO that is not readily available to the public.
