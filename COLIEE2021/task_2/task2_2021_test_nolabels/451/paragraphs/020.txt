The argument for disclosure is made more strongly in relation to the methodology and principles that underlie the risk assessment faced by those claiming to be within the PDRCC class. This matter was highlighted at the hearing of this application for judicial review, and, as earlier noted, there was no evidence before the court of guidelines, instructions, or principles underlying, or to be applied in assessing, risk. The definition of the class under s. 2(1) of the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978, SOR/78-172, as amended (the "
Regulations
"), provides in part:
"'member of the post-determination refugee claimants in Canada class' means an immigrant in Canada
. . . . .
(a) who ... is ...,
(b) who has not ..., and
(c) who if removed to a country to which the immigrant could be removed would be subjected to an objectively identifiable risk, which risk would apply in every part of that country and would not be faced generally by other individuals in or from that country,
(i) to the immigrant's life, other than a risk to the immigrant's life that is caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care,
(ii) of extreme sanctions against the immigrant, or
(iii) of inhumane treatment of the immigrant."
Following the hearing, counsel for the respondent, as permitted, provided to the applicant for comment a copy of the respondent's internal documents for guidance of PCDO's, including a "Draft Manual for PCDOs" and a modular training program for PCDOs including that draft manual.
