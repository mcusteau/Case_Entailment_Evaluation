The applicant contends that citations given for a number of the documents listed as consulted by the PCDO were obscure and not readily identifiable. In particular reference is made to "CA Reports", to "IPS reports", to "AFP" and to "Indexed Media Review Binders on El Salvador Jan-Sept/95". While it is noted by the applicant that the Decision Record states specifically that the "decision is based on recent information drawn from a range of public sources", it is urged that the documents referred to are of a specialized nature, not normal country condition reports and moreover, they were cited by obscure references not understandable to the public. It is urged that they fall within the class of "extrinsic evidence", about which the applicant should have been apprised and given opportunity to comment, as referred to by Mr. Justice Rothstein in
Nadarajah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 112 F.T.R. 296 (T.D.), at para. 7 where he said in part,
"Generally, extrinsic evidence is evidence of which the applicants are unaware because it comes from an outside source. ... In the context of information on country conditions, if the information relied upon by the Post Claim Determination Officer is information to which the applicants could not have had access, and it is material to the decision made, I think the information might well constitute extrinsic evidence."
