Counsel for the respondent Minister urged that no question be certified. The question proposed in regard to documents from the public domain concerning general country conditions is similar to one that has been certified by Rothstein, J., in
Nadarajah
, supra, and also in
Singh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1996] F.C.J. No. 781 (T.D.), and by Heald, D.J., in
Xavier
, supra, and by Gibson, J., in
Garcia
, supra. In those cases, the facts relating to the PCDO's use of public information without notice to the applicant are generally analogous to the facts in this case. The question posed concerns the fairness of the process followed by the PCDO.
