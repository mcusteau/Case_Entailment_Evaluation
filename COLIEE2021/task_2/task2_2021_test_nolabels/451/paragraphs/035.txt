Counsel for the applicant urges that certain questions be certified for consideration by the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 83(1) of the
Act
. At the hearing counsel proposed the following question:
"whether an Immigration Officer conducting a review pursuant to the PDRCC regulations violates the principle of fairness, as enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Shah
, when he or she fails to disclose, in advance of determining the matter,
a) documents relied upon from public sources in relation to general country conditions, or
b) documents that elucidate the theoretical principles and methodological guidelines that are relied upon to carry out the PDRCC risk assessment."
Following the hearing, the second aspect of that question, concerning risk assessment methodology, was elaborated upon by counsel for the applicant in written submissions proposing three questions specifically relating to the methodology for determining "objectively identifiable risk" in this case, and generally.
