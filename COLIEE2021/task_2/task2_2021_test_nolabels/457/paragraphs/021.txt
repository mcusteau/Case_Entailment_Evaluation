[21]
It seems clear to the Court that s. 112 of the
Act
and s. 231 of the
Regulations
do not deal with the same concept. On the one hand, if I consider the ordinary and generally accepted meaning of the phrase "come into force" used in s. 112 of the
Act
, it means (Translation) "become enforceable". On the other, if I look at s. 231 of the
Regulations
, which refers to a stay of the removal order, I note that the verb "stay" means (Translation) "postpone for a time, defer, suspend, await the expiry of a deadline for proceeding".
