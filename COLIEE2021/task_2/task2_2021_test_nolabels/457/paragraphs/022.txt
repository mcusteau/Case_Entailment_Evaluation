It is clearly apparent from this return to the fundamental rules of interpretation that it is quite possible to say that an order may be stayed but still have come into force. Accordingly, I feel that the removal order came into force at the time the Board's decision was made, but was simply suspended by the filing of the application for judicial review. Consequently, it follows that the officer could validly consider she had jurisdiction to conduct the PRRA, since the removal order had in fact come into force as required by s. 112 of the
Act
