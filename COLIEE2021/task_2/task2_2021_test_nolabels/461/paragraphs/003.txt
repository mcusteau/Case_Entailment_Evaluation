On March 5, 2008, the Board rejected the applicant's claim as it found the applicant to be non credible. The Board concluded that the applicant is not, and never has been, a Falun Gong practitioner. First, the Board found that the applicant's failure to file a summons for her arrest, which she claimed was actually left by the PSB at her home in China, was fatal to her claim, and that her explanations for not producing it were unsatisfactory. Second, the applicant's story of departing China without going through security check points, and boarding an Air Canada plane without a boarding pass, was said to be implausible and inconsistent with the documentary evidence.
