Prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick
, 2008 SCC 9 (
Dunsmuir
), this Court had held that the Board's findings of fact and credibility, and its assessment of the evidence are within its specific expertise and therefore attract a highly deferential standard of review, in line with the former patent unreasonableness standard (
Aguebor v. (Canada) (Minister of Employment and Immigration),
[1993] F.C.J. No. 732 at para.4, 160 N.R. 315). The standard is now "reasonableness," meaning that this Court will only intervene if the impugned decision is said to be unreasonable, in the sense that it falls outside the "range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law":
