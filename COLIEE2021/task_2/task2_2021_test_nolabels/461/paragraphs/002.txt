The applicant, Lijuan Wang, is a citizen of the People's Republic of China. She claims to have a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of the Communist regime, and in particular the Public Security Bureau (PSB), by reason of her political opinion as a Falun Gong practitioner. The applicant alleges that she started practising Falun Gong in August 2005 on the advice of a friend who was concerned about the applicant's health following the applicant's divorce and diagnosis with angina. The applicant submits that on April 7, 2006, she was advised that two fellow practitioners had been arrested while distributing Falun Gong leaflets. As a result, the applicant immediately went into hiding at a relative's home. On April 9, 2006, while in hiding, the applicant learned that the PSB had been to her home on April 9, 2006, looking to arrest her for being involved in illegal Falun Gong activities. The applicant therefore made arrangements to be smuggled out of the country. She arrived in Canada on July 24, 2006. The applicant alleges having learned that the PSB, subsequent to her departure, was still trying to locate her and that the fellow practitioners who had been arrested were still in jail. Thus, the applicant filed for refugee protection a few days after her arrival in Canada. The applicant asserts that she has been practising Falun Gong on a daily basis while in Canada. She has also found a practising centre at Milliken Park in Toronto.
