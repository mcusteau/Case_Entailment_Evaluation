These decisions were also the subject of submissions to the Court in
Thamotharem
. Following a review of each case, Justice Blanchard expressed the following conclusion at paragraph 46 of his reasons:
"In my opinion, in none of these cases did the Court establish that the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness require that refugee claimants be questioned by their counsel first. In fact, whether the Board's choice of the order of questioning accorded with natural justice or procedural fairness was not before the Court in any of the cases. The cases all dealt with specific circumstances in which the Court held that the Refugee Board's conduct of the hearing was improper or led to an error in the Board's findings of fact."
And further at paragraph 53:
"In my opinion, the cases cited by the Applicant and the Intervener do not lead to the conclusion that a meaningful opportunity to present one's case includes a right to question first. Rather, they reaffirm that the Board is entitled to control the procedures of a hearing but that the Board must conduct the hearing in a way that does not unfairly restrict the claimant's right to present her or his case."
