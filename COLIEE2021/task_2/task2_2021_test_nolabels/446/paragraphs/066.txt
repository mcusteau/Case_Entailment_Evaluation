What constitutes a "reasonable opportunity to present evidence" must depend upon the circumstances of each case. It may be that in a particular refugee determination hearing it would be necessary for the claimant's counsel to question first in order to ensure that his or her evidence is properly presented. But I have difficulty understanding why that would be necessary in every case or why it is essential in fundamental justice terms that the claimant have the option at his or her discretion to determine the order of questioning, as the applicants have argued.
