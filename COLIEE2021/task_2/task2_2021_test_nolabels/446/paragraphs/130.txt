At the trial level, the Court in
Ainsley
found the statement to be mandatory and regulatory in nature based on three factors: (1) the language of the policy; (2) the practical effect of failing to comply with the policy; and (3) the evidence with respect to the expectations of the Commission and staff regarding the implementation of the policy: see
Ainsley Financial Corp. et al. v. Ontario Securities Commission et al.
(1993), 14 O.R.(3d) 280; 106 D.L.R.(4th) 507 (Gen. Div.).
