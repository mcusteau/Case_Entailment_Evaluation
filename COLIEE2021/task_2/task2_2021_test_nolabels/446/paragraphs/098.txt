In my view, the conclusion that the process was intended by Parliament to be inquisitorial rather than adversarial in nature is supported on the face of the legislation. Notwithstanding Professor Galloway's evidence and the Court's awareness of egregious examples of hostile and aggressive questioning, I am not persuaded that a failure to respect that intent by RPOs or Board members in individual cases establishes that the hearings are adversarial. The process was not designed to be a contest between parties adverse in interest but rather an inquiry into whether a claim to Canada's protection is being legitimately made. In that context, a close examination of the merits of the claim is consistent with the nature of the process and the roles of the member and the RPO.
