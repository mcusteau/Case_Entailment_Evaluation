The applicants submit that the enactment by Parliament in
IRPA
of provisions for a Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), combined with the failure of the Governor-in-Council to bring the RAD into effect enhances the duty of fairness owed to the applicant and decreases the deference owed by the Court to a decision of the Board on refugee protection. The applicants submit that the duty is greater and deference less than if the appeal provisions had not been legislated.
