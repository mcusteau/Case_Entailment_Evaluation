I accept that the language of Guideline 7 could be construed as mandatory in nature by an inexperienced and less confident Board member and that Board members in general may, as found by Justice Blanchard, feel some top-down pressure to follow it. But that does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that members consider themselves bound to apply it as if it were legislation, a regulation or a formal rule made under the Chairperson's authority.
