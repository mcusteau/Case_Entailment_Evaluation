In my view, the question of bias in this context has to be raised on a case-by-case basis. I note, without deciding the matter, that in the Jones application record there is evidence of what counsel described as "long, nasty, brutish and hostile" examination of the claimant by the Member. That evidence may support a finding that in the particular circumstances of that case, a reasonable apprehension of bias is made out. That is to be decided by the judge hearing the merits of the case. It does not, in my view, support a finding that institutional bias results from the questioning order called for by Guideline 7.
When must an objection to the use of Guideline 7 be raised?
