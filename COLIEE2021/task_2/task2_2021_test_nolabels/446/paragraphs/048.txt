I note that in
Thamotharem
, neither the applicant nor the intervener argued that the Chairperson's standard order of questioning procedure violates the principles of fundamental justice guaranteed under s. 7 of the
Charter
. Rather, they based their submissions on the common law principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. Accordingly, Justice Blanchard determined the content of the procedural protections to be afforded the applicant in that case by an analysis of the factors described by Justice L'Heureux-Dub√© in
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817; 243 N.R. 22; 174 D.L.R.(4th) 193 (
Baker
). The applicants submit that should be the starting point in considering fundamental justice.
