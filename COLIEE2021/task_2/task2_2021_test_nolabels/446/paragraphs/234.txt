If the applicants failed to cite a denial of procedural fairness in their applications for leave, judicial review of the applications should be confined to the grounds for which they sought leave. The common "basket clause" formula "such further and other grounds as the applicants may advise and this Honourable Court permit" is not a complete and concise statement of the grounds intended to be argued within the meaning of Rule 301. However, in some cases, the issue was identified in the memorandum of fact and law filed with the application.
