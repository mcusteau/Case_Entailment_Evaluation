[184]
In this instance, Parliament has seen fit to equip the Board with two mechanisms by which to determine its process; the rule making authority under s. 161 and the authority to issue guidelines and to identify Board decisions as jurisprudential guides under paragraph 159(1)(h). The choice of instrument has been left to the Chairperson, subject to the requirements that changes to the
Rules
require the approval of the Governor-in-Council and must be laid before Parliament. There is no limitation in the statute on the scope of the guidelines that the Chairperson may issue so long as they are intended to "assist members in carrying out their duties". Nor is there any restriction from issuing guidelines that pertain to procedural matters. There is no express conflict between Guideline 7 and any of the Rules made pursuant to s. 161.
