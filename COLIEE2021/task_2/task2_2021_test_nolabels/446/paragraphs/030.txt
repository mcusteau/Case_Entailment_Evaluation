It appears from the evidence, and submissions of counsel, that prior to the implementation of Guideline 7, it was common in Toronto, and possibly Calgary and Vancouver, although the evidence with respect to those cities is not clear, for counsel for the claimant to begin the questioning at the hearings. The RPO (if present) would then question the claimant, followed by the Board member if he or she had any remaining matters to raise. This practice, the applicants submit, was more in keeping with the nature of a quasi-judicial hearing and allowed for an "examination-in-chief" in which claimants were encouraged to fully recount their histories with the assistance of counsel whom they had come to know and trust.
