The difficulty created by this court's conflicting interpretation of paragraph 5(1)(c) may soon end. Bill C-63 [see foot­note 15] proposes the enactment of a new
Citizenship of Canada Act
which is in­tended to clarify the residency requirement. According to the new proposals, a person resides, for a given day, in Canada "... if the person, during the day, ... is physically present in Canada". [see footnote 16] This change appears to remove the discretion to credit the applicant for citizenship, with days towards the residency requirement, when the person is in fact absent from Canada. Bill C-63 will also remove the statutory appeal, now found in s. 14(5). Consequently, if and when Bill C-63 is enacted, the current debate concerning the legal test for residency and the issue of the standard of review of a citizenship statutory appeal will no longer be relevant.
