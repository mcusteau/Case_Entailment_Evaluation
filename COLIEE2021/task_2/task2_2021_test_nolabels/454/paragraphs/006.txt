Before the RAD the Applicants brought an application, pursuant to s 29(1) of the
Refugee Appeal Division Rules
, SOR/2012-257 ("Rules"), seeking to introduce a psychiatric assessment prepared by Dr. Monica Choi, dated March 6, 2015 ("Choi Report"), as evidence of the female Applicant's deteriorating mental state and distress exacerbated by the negative decision in her refugee claim. Because it was relevant to the assessment of the IFA and met the requirements of s 110(4) of the IRPA, the RAD admitted the report as new evidence. The Applicants also sought to introduce a DNA report ("DNA Report"), and a report from SIFS Forensic Science Organization India ("Birth Certificate Report") concerning the changing of the name of a child's father on his or her Indian birth certificate, both intended to refute credibility findings made by the RPD. The RAD determined that, because the availability of an IFA was determinative of the appeal, it was unnecessary to determine if that new evidence was admissible as it was not relevant to the IFA.
