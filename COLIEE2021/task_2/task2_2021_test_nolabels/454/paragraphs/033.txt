Justice Mosley found that the RPD had noted the applicant's fragile mental health but found that an IFA was available despite the psychological opinion in evidence. Further, that the RPD had failed to thoroughly assess the reasonableness of the IFA locations in the context of the applicant's situation and vulnerable mindset. As a young man with little education and no prospects of employment he was in a high risk category and his lack of family and fragile psychological state compounded that risk. Therefore, the decision of the RPD was unreasonable. Similarly, in

, Justice Beaudry found that the applicant suffered from physical and emotional stress, and was a single mother with no formal education and no family support. The RPD's analysis concluding that there was a possible IFA was unreasonable because it did not take into account the applicant's personal particular situation. In the assessment of the second prong of the test, an IFA must be reasonable for the particular claimant in the context of the particular country.
