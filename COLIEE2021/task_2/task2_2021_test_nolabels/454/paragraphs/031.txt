It is of note that Dr. Choi referred to her discussions with the female Applicant as well as with her daughter, Cheheleena, who believed that her mother's distress was exacerbated by the adjustment of residing in a new country and having limited financial security. Further, that the stress of having the family's refugee claim rejected and the possibility of having to return to India contributed to her mother's overall distress. Dr. Choi concluded that the female Applicant continues to experience profound fear and depressed mood which were precipitated by the traumatic events she experienced in India with her ex-husband. Her anxiety and depression were further exacerbated by having to adjust to life in Canada and even more so by recently having her refugee claim rejected and the resultant possibility of having to return to India. Dr. Choi stated that the female Applicant's presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD and major depressive disorder, single episode, chronic, severe, and suggested a trial of two medications. Significantly, however, there was no suggestion as to the impact, if any, that return to India would have on the female Applicant's mental health. Nor was there any evidence in the record that the female Applicant was taking the suggested medications, although the report states that Dr. Choi would see her for follow up in two weeks' time, or that she would be unable to access those medications in India.
