The Applicants rely on the affidavit of the Indian lawyer to link Subhas to Sikh fundamentalists and submit that the RAD failed to mention this critical evidence. However, the RAD, in reviewing the record, specifically noted the affidavit which it stated attested to the background of Subhas. The RAD described only an excerpt of its content in its reasons but what the affiant actually says is significant; which is that Sh. Singh Gogna was the father of Sh. Subhash Gogna, and that the father ".. was associated with Sikh extermist [sic] group named Babbar Khals and he was killed by the police in the domestic vilance [sic] in the year 1984 ... That he was santed [sic] and was also had bad contact with interrogative people. He was drunker [sic], unemployed, aggressive and worthless ... That he had relation with other women as well". In my view, at best, all that can be taken from this affidavit is that Subhas' father was associated with Babbar Khals, although the affiant does not provide the basis of his belief nor does he explain the nature of that group and how this is known to him. Nor do the Applicants explain how this purported association to the Babbar Khals by Subhas' father relates to Subhas.
