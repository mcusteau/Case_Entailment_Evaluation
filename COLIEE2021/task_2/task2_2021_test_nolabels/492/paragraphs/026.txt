To be certified, the question must be one which transcends the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation, contemplates issues of broad significance or general application, and be one that is determinative of the appeal (
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Liyanagamage (F.C.A.)
, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1637, at para. 4). In my view, the question posed by the applicant's satisfies this test and therefore shall be certified.
