The test under s. 97 of the Act is distinct from the test under section 96. As Rouleau J. noted in
Ahmad v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, 2004 FC 808, [2004] F.C.J. No. 995 (QL), at para. 21, s. 97 "requires the Board to apply a different criterion pertaining to the issue of whether the applicant's removal may or may not expose him personally to the risks and dangers referred to in paragraphs 97(1)(
a
) and (
b
) of the Act" and must be assessed with reference to the personal situation of the applicant. Moreover, he indicated that the "assessment of the applicant's fear must be made in concreto, and not from an abstract and general perspective" (at para. 22).
