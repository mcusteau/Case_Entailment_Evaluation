In his analysis of the claim, Beaudry J. noted, at para. 18, that the applicant was the subject of general violence, which was the fallout of criminal activity and that "[as] a group, people who are perceived to be wealthy are not marginalized in Haiti; rather they are more frequent targets of criminal activity." Further, at para. 23, in the context of the s. 97 analysis, Beaudry J. asserted:
It is my opinion that the Board did not err by determining that the applicant did not face a particularized risk upon his return. [...] However, as discussed above, the risk faced by the applicant is generalized. The risk of violence is one which every person in Haiti faces. The documentary evidence submitted in support of this case indicates that there is a serious risk to the personal safety of all in Haiti. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has recommended the suspension of forced returns to Haiti.
