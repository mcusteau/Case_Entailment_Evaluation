As I read the relevant portion of clause 27, it says that the Bill of Lading is subject to English law and jurisdiction. While the work "dispute" is not found in the relevant sentence, I cannot imagine anything other than a dispute in which there would have to be reference to English law and jurisdiction. While plaintiff's counsel urges that the claim for freight is beyond doubt, the defendant has raised certain defences. The defendant, in its statement of defence, says that delivery has been only partially completed. There are other allegations. For purposes of this issue, it is sufficient that a claim is made and a defence filed. I am not asked to render summary judgment or otherwise adjudicate the claim. The status of the matter at this time is that there has been a claim filed and it has been defended. Surely, this is a dispute.
