Defendant's counsel also submits, inter alia, that there is no factual connection with England in this case. Further, he says that if the counterclaim must be proceeded with in England only, there would obviously have to be two actions instead of one. These additional reasons satisfy me that, even if the plaintiff's and defendant's actions do not constitute an amendment to the Bill of Lading, there are strong reasons for this court assuming jurisdiction in respect of the counterclaim. The plaintiff's motion for a stay is dismissed.
