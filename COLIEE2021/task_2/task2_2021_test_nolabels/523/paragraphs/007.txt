Counsel for the plaintiff says that
Vallorbe
is distinguishable. He says that clause 27 of the Bill of Lading applies only to disputes and that the claim in respect of unpaid freight is not a dispute. He says clause 27 does not apply to the claim for freight because it is beyond doubt, and that he should even be able to obtain summary judgment in this court. On the other hand, he argues that the defendant's counterclaim is a dispute and is subject to clause 27.
