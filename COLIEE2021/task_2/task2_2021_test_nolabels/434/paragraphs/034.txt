If, on the other hand, the Minister decides that there was a failure to report, the Minister must then render a second decision, as per section 29 of the
PCMLTFA
, with respect to the appropriate sanction for the infraction. This decision is effectively a review of the quantum of the sanction imposed by the Customs official pursuant to subsection 18(2) (i.e., full forfeiture or a penalty ranging from $250.00 to $5,000.00). Section 29 of the
PCMLTFA
requires the Minister to either confirm the Customs official's decision with respect to the sanction or to reduce it to some lesser penalty. This second decision of the Minister can be termed "the section 29 Decision".
