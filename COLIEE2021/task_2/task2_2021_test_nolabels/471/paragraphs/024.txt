I considered a similar issue in Hosseini v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2002] F.C.J. No. 509, online: QL, and found that, with respect to credibility issues, this Court cannot substitute its opinion for that of the Board, unless there is a patently unreasonable error. The applicant cannot simply repeat in judicial review an explanation given to the Board, a specialized tribunal, which it has already dismissed: Muthuthevar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1996] F.C.J. No. 207, online: QL.
