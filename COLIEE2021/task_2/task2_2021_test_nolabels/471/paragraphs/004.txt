In July 1999, the Chinese government banned the practice of Falun Gong. Lin Li was arrested and detained twice by police. Although the applicant himself had no troubles with the police, he started to secretly compile information on the Chinese government's treatment of Falun Gong followers. In spite of the fact that Lin Li told the applicant in March 2001 that the authorities had killed his former principal, who was also a Falun Gong member, the applicant continued to collect information, namely through Web sites that are banned in China.
