Section 92(1) of the
Public Service Staff Relations
Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-35, as amended, provides that where an employee has presented a grievance up to and including the final level in the grievance process with respect to the interpretation or the application of a provision of a collective agreement, and the grievance has not been dealt with to the satisfaction of the employee, the employee may, subject to limitations not relevant here, refer the grievance to adjudication. The respondent took advantage of this right. Section 96.1 of the
Act
provides to an adjudicator, in relation to an adjudication, all the powers, rights and privileges of the Public Service Staff Relations Board, once again subject to an exception that is not relevant here. The powers of the Board are broadly defined in s. 21 and the following sections of the
Act
. Section 96(2) of the
Act
reads as follows:
"(2) No adjudicator shall, in respect of any grievance, render any decision thereon the effect of which would be to require the amendment of a collective agreement or an arbitral award."
