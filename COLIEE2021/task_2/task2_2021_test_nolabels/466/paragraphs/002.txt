The facts giving rise to the respondent's grievance and thus, to this application for judicial review, may briefly be summarized as follows. At all relevant times, the respondent was employed by Transport Canada at the Winnipeg airport. His employment was as a Technical Duty Manager. His employment was governed by the EL collective agreement, Code 404/89 (404-92 as extended), a collective agreement in effect between the Treasury Board of Canada and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 2228 (the "collective agreement"). On March 21, 1995, the respondent submitted a request for one day's annual leave for April 8, 1995. He apparently wished to attend a social/sporting event on that day at which he would receive an award. The employer denied the request and indicated orally that it had been submitted too late and, if granted, would have required the payment of overtime that was not budgeted for. Thus, the grievance.
