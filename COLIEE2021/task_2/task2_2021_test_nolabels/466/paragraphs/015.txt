[15]
Here, there can be no allegation that the Tribunal failed to take into account the whole of the collective agreement in its decision. By ordering the remedy that it did, it clearly added to the respondent's leave entitlement fixed or determinable under the collective agreement, without justification based on any provision of the collective agreement. Against whatever standard of review is applicable, whether it be correctness or reasonableness or some standard in between, I am satisfied that the Tribunal, in providing for the remedy that it did, committed a jurisdictional error by contravening the clear and unequivocal limitation of its jurisdiction imposed by s. 96(2) of the
Act
