In
Royal Oak Mines Inc. v. Canada Labour Relations Board et al.
, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 369; 193 N.R. 81, Mr. Justice Cory, referring to the above quotation from
C.U.P.E., Local 963 v. New Brunswick Liquor Corp.
, wrote:
"The appellant argued that the question, as to the appropriate remedy for the Canada Labour Relations Board to have imposed in this case, involves the jurisdictional limits of the powers granted to the Board and that, accordingly, the standard by which this court must review the order is one of correctness. I cannot agree. There is an abundance of case law which cautions courts against too easily identifying a statutory provision as jurisdictional."
