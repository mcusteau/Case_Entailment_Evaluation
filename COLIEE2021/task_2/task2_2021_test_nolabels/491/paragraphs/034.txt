The CHRC's decision to dismiss both of the applicant's complaints without proceeding to a request for a full tribunal hearing was dated February 21, 1992 and reads as follows:
"Dear Ms. Slattery:
The Canadian Human Rights Commission has reviewed the investigation report of your complaints (H30995) and (H31558) against Department of National Defence dated February 19, 1988 and October 6, 1989 respectively, alleging discrimination in employment on the grounds of age and sex. The Commission also reviewed the submission dated February 6, 1992, signed by Lucie Lalibert√©.
The Commission has decided, pursuant to subparagraph 44(3)(b)(i) of the
Canadian Human Rights Act
, to dismiss the complaints because on the evidence the allegation of discrimination is unfounded.
As the Commission's decision is final, we have closed our files on these complaints."
