On this matter, I must disagree with the premise of the applicant, that the conclusion that the issue of the foundedness of the applicant's allegation of discrimination is a question of fact, as opposed to a question of law. As stated by Professor Wade:
"Questions of law must be distinguished from questions of fact, but this has been one of the situations where the rules have taken different forms under judicial manipulation ...
"The simpler and more logical doctrine has been recognized in many judgments. This is that matters of facts are the primary facts of the particular case which have to be established before the law can be applied, the 'facts which are observed by the witnesses and proved by testimony', to which should be added any facts of common knowledge of which the court will take notice without proof. Whether these facts, once established, satisfy some legal definition or requirement must be a question of law, for the question then is how to interpret and apply the law to those established facts."
