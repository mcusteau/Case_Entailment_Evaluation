The applicant attempted, on October 26, 1987, to initiate a complaint with the CHRC with regard to the events which gave rise to the complaints in the case at bar. The applicant only succeeded in filing the complaints with the CHRC on February 19, 1988 and October 6, 1989; these complaints were numbered H30995 and H31558 respectively. In the meanwhile, the applicant was told that the Public Service Staff Relations Board (PSSRB) was the appropriate forum for her case. PSSRB Hearings were held, although the applicant submits that she did not raise issue of discrimination with the PSSRB, as the CHRC was the appropriate forum for such issues. The PSSRB deliberated on the case for over 25 days, from November 30, 1988 to October 19, 1989 and rendered its decision on March 12, 1990. In this decision, it was held that the respondent acted in bad faith in dismissing the complainant, and that the respondent's actions were tantamount to de facto dismissal of the applicant. The applicant was granted two years of salary as damages as well as severance pay.
