With regard to neutrality, it has been held that if the CHRC simply adopts an investigator's conclusions without giving reasons, and those conclusions were made in a manner which may be characterized as biased, a reviewable error occurs. In the case of
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. v. Canadian Human Rights Commission et al.
(Court file no. T-1578-91, decision rendered December 15, 1993, NoÃ«l, J.), [see (1993), 71 F.T.R. 214] an investigator, on the suggestion of a Regional Director of the CHRC, added an extra ground of sexual discrimination to a complaint filed against the C.B.C. without initially obtaining a formal ruling under s. 41(e) of the
Act
as to whether the new complaint should be dealt with by the CHRC. A s. 41(e) ruling was finally requested by the CBC. The CBC argued that the CHRC should not be able to proceed with the investigation of the amended complaint as it raised new grounds and the events giving rise to the allegations had taken place more than one year before the amendment and, as such, the allegation was time-barred.
