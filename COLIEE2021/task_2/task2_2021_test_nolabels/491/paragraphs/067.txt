Although the investigation appears to have only been conducted over a period of three days, it appears from the report that all of the fundamental issues contained in the applicant's complaint, including the section head's treatment of the applicant, were considered by the investigator. The fact that "no analysis" of certain specific allegations was contained in the written report of the investigator (the investigator's report only a summary of each side's story) or in the CHRC's reasons for dismissal of the complaint does not indicate that these allegations were not considered by the investigator and is by no means a ground for review. I find support for this conclusion in the fact that there is no general common law duty for administrative bodies to give reasons for their decisions, [See, inter alia,
R. v. Gaming Board of Great Britain, ex parte Benaim
, [1970] 2 All E.R. 528 (C.A.);
Glendenning Motorways Inc. v. Royal Transportation Ltd.
(1975), 59 D.L.R.(3d) 89 (Man. C.A.)] and by the fact that the
Act
is silent with regard to the necessity of written reasons, in contrast to s. 42(1), which applies to cases in which the Commission finds a complaint inadmissible on one of the grounds listed in s. 41. As Justice Pinard concluded in the case of
Mercier v. Commission canadienne des droits de la personne
(1991), 51 F.T.R. 205, at p. 213: "... the absence of reason for the decision is no more a breach of procedural fairness than of the
Act
".
