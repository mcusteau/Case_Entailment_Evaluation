I note in the first place that complaints H30995 and H31558 were both framed exclusively in terms of alleged discrimination suffered by the applicant personally. Nowhere in the particulars of either complaint were allegations made regarding systemic discrimination or unequal pay for work of equal value at CSE generally. Indeed, much of the concern over the systemic nature of discrimination at the CSE only appeared in the applicant's responding submission, which was prepared by Ms. Lalibert√© and submitted on February 6, 1992. As such, I cannot characterize such evidence as "fundamental" to the applicant's complaints.
