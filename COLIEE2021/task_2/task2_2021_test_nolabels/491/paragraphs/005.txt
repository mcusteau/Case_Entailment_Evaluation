The applicant filed a number of complaints of discrimination with the CHRC. The first complaint (1982) was apparently not accepted by the CHRC in order to maintain the security of the CSE. The second (1985), which pertained to a training film used at the CSE entitled "The Human Touch Performance Appraisal", was examined by the CHRC. On August 25, 1986, the CHRC sent a letter to the CSE, advising, inter alia, that "the video portrays women negatively while men are seen as competent and adept at managing". While the CHRC recommended that the film was not an appropriate tool to use for training, it held that "it would be difficult to determine whether there is reasonable ground to believe the use of this video is discriminatory".
