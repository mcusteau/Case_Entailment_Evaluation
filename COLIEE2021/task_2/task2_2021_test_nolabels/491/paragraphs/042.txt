Latif
involved the refusal of the CHRC to exercise jurisdiction over alleged discrimination that occurred against the complainant when he was dismissed by the Department of National Revenue, Customs and Excise. The incident took place prior to the coming into force of the
Act
and the CHRC hearing and application for judicial review took place prior to the amendment of ss. 18 and 28 of the
Federal Court Act
. It is also to be noted that the CHRC's decision not to deal with the complaint was justified on the ground that it appeared to be beyond its jurisdiction. Therefore, technically, the complaint was dismissed pursuant to s. 33 of the
Act
(now s. 41) as opposed to s. 36 (now s. 44). Nevertheless, the principles of judicial review enunciated by the Federal Court of Appeal - that since the result of the decision involved a final determination of the complainant's rights, the complainant must be given the opportunity to be heard, even if merely in writing - are relevant to the case at bar.
