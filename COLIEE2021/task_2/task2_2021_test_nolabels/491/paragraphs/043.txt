[43]
In
Radulesco
, investigation procedures were initiated by the CHRC and the complainant's case was eventually dismissed as unsubstantiated under s. 36(3)(b) (the equivalent to the current s. 44(3)(b)) of the
Act
. Although the complainant in that case was invited to submit comments prior to the CHRC making its final decision, she was only provided with a limited indication of the factual basis upon which the investigator's recommendations were made. Furthermore, when the complainant requested a copy of the investigator's report and further information as to its underlying reasons, she was advised that such material would only be available upon approval by the CHRC. The investigator's reports were not received by the complainant until after the final decision had been made by the CHRC. Lamer, J., (as he then was), held that procedural fairness requires that the complainant be provided with an opportunity to make submissions, at least in writing, before any action is taken on the basis of an investigator's report and, in particular, in order to ensure that such submissions are made on an informed basis, the CHRC must, prior to its decision, disclose the substance of the case against the complainant.
