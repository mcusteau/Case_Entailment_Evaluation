With regard to the applicant's submission that the investigator's conclusion that "the allegations in the human rights complaints were addressed by the PSSRB" was sufficiently deficient so as to constitute an error of law, I conclude that these comments were simply another way of saying that "the allegations of the human rights complaint may give rise to a claim for wrongful dismissal but do not constitute discrimination". Although the wording of the statement was unfortunate, it certainly does not give rise to a reviewable error.
