[81]
There is no evidence before me indicating that the CHRC failed to consider the material that was contained in the applicant's submission of February 6, 1992, nor am I convinced that the CHRC's decision to dismiss the complaint was the result of bad faith, irrelevant considerations or improper purposes. I am furthermore not convinced that the decision was unreasonable in light of all of the material that was before the CHRC. The CHRC simply exercised its discretion and made a decision that was open to it to make based on the evidence before it.
iii) Is The CHRC's Conclusion That The
Appellant's Allegation Of Discrimination
Is Unfounded A Finding Of Fact That
Was Made In A Perverse Or Capricious
Manner Or Without Regard For The
Material Before It, And
Therefore Subject
To Judicial Review According To
Subsection 18.1(4) Of
The Federal Court Act?
