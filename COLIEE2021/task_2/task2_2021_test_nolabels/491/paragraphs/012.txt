The specific events which give rise to the complaints in the case at bar stem from a reorganization of the applicant's work group that was undertaken in 1984. In 1985, the applicant's job was disestablished when the functions of her unit, 01B, were merged with another unit, M4B10, (the latter apparently being part of the "M" group) The applicant's position was most seriously affected by this reorganization, since she was the only member of her unit who was not offered an transfer to the "M" group, which was apparently given jurisdiction for cryptanalysis. According to the applicant, her position was disestablished because Mr. Johnston wanted to get rid of her. The explanation offered by the CSE is entirely different. According to the submission made to the CHRC by S.P. Hunter, the Human Rights Coordinator of the Department of National Defence, during this same period, a Cray computer was obtained for the "M" group, for which special knowledge in mathematics and computer science was required. The applicant did not have a degree or the mathematics skills to operate the Cray computer.
