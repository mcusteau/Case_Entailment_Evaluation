When
S.E.P.Q.A.
,
Latif
and
Radulesco
were decided, s. 36(3) of the
Act
required the CHRC to dismiss complaints if the CHRC was of the view that they were not "substantiated". In
S.E.P.Q.A.
, Sopinka, J., made it clear that the decision to dismiss or to go on was intimately linked to the CHRC's perception of the merits of the case:
"It is not intended that this be a determination where the evidence is weighed as in a judicial proceeding but rather the Commission must determine whether there is reasonable basis in the evidence for proceeding to the next stage. It was not intended that there be a formal hearing preliminary to the decision as to whether to appoint a tribunal. Rather the process moves from the investigatory stage to the judicial or quasi-judicial stage if the test prescribed in [the
Act
] is met." (
