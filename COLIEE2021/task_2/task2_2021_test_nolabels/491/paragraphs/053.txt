The requirement of thoroughness of investigation stems from the essential role that investigators play in determining the merits of particular complaints. This essential role was recognized by the Supreme Court in the
S.E.P.Q.A.
case. In the words of Sopinka, J.:
"In general, complainants look to the Commission to lead evidence before a tribunal appointed under [s. 49], and therefore investigation of the complaint is essential if the [CHRC] is to carry out this role." (
S.E.P.Q.A.
, at p. 898)
