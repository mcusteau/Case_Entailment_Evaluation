Also of importance was an article entitled "Dobjani meets with the German MPs to help the immigrants in Germany" (25 July 2005) which was not mentioned by the PRRA officer. Of particular relevance is the following excerpt:
[...] The argument presented by the Albanian party and Mr. Dobjani about the repatriation of the Albanian citizens was that the human rights in Albania are heavily violated [...] The Albanian party has requested that some special categories of emigrants be especially helped. [...] One category of emigrants that should be especially helped is those people whose life is threatened by vengeance. [...] (page 480 of the Tribunal Record)
This extract directly contradicts the PRRA officer's finding that state protection exists and should have been addressed in the decision.
