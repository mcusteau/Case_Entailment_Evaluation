In
Dunsmuir, supra
, at para. 47, the Court expounded upon the meaning of this standard and stated that an analysis conducted according to this standard will be concerned with "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process [and also with] [...] whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law" (
Dunsmuir
,
supra
, at para. 47).
