I am not persuaded that this is the only possible reading of the relevant NOC provisions. The absence of any ETF for accountants may indicate that "accountant" is intended to be a generic description of the specific occupations listed in 1111 (C.A., C.G.A., C.M.A.), and that there is no occupation of accountant "simpliciter". Those whose work can be described as involving accounting, but who are not a C.A., C.G.A., or C.M.A., may ask to be assessed in the NOC categories of "miscellaneous accountant" or "book keeper", as indeed the applicant had been in his previous visa application.
