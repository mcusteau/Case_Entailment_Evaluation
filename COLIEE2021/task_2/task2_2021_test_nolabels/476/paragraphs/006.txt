In light of a number of inconsistencies, implausible statements and embellishments found in the information provided by the applicant to an immigration officer upon landing, in his Personal Information Form (PIF), and his testimony, the RPB determines that there is no basis to the claim due to the applicant's lack of credibility, and concludes that there is no serious possibility that Mr. Lin would be persecuted or be subjected personally to a risk to his life or to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or be in danger of torture by any authority if he were to return to China.
