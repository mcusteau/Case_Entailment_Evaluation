In March 2005, Mr. Lin claims he opened a store in his home town of Changle City in Fujian Province. His store sold books as well as audio and video material to customers whom he alleges were all from his home town. From time to time, some of the customers who were familiar with the applicant would ask him to help sell their products in his store. In May of 2006, his friend Mr. Chen did just that.
