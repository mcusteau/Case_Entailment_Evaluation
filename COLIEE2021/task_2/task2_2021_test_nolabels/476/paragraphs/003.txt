The applicant alleges that on May 10, Mr. Chen gave him approximately fifty (50) books and DVDs on consignment and told him that the contents of the DVDs were about Buddhist teachings and Qi Gong. The applicant claims he agreed to sell these items and in fact, did, after having watched 2 of the DVDs. However, he claims he did know about Falun Gong and thought the material was about what Mr. Chen had said. Three days later, after he had sold ten (10) of the DVDs, members of the Public Security Bureau (PSB) acting on complaints from customers that these materials were about the Falun Gong, descended on his store, confiscated all the merchandise and detained his cousin who was minding the store that day in the absence of the applicant who was in San Ming City.
