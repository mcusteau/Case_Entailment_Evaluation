Having reviewed the evidence in record, this Court notes that in its reasons the Board does not make mention of the amended PIF. This amendment was introduced less than one month before the RPD hearing. However, the RPD benefits from the presumption that it has considered all of the evidence before it, though this presumption is not so strong as to overcome an omission to comment on important evidence which on its face strongly supports a conclusion different than the one actually reached (
