Here, in the context of a series of quasi instantaneous transactions where it cannot really be said that the borrowed funds are used to fill a hole left by the "withdrawal" of funds previously used in the borrower's business, it is rather doubtful that the Trans-Prairie reasoning can be applied. It is in any event clear that the excess of borrowed funds over the retained earning and the paid up capital of the plaintiff as of August 20, 1979 cannot constitute within the reasoning of Trans-Prairie a replacement of capital which has already been used in the business. I consider, therefore, that the plaintiff has failed to show that such excess of borrowed funds was used at the relevant time for the purpose of earning income from a business or property, and that the interest paid thereon ought not to be deducted pursuant to s. 20(1)(c)(i) of the Act.
