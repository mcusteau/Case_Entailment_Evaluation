In its consideration of the Trans-Prairie case, the Supreme Court of Â Canada, in Bronfman Trust, did not go farther than to agree to the fact that in that case "the money previously subscribed by preferred shareholders had been used by the company for the purpose of earning income from the business" (p. 5063) and to find "perfectly correct insofar as it goes" the proposition "that it is the current use and not the original use of borrowed money that determines eligibility for a deduction" (p. 5066). Finally, the Supreme Court of Canada only referred to the Trans-Prairie case to state, at page 5066:
"With the exception of Trans-Prairie, then, the reasoning of which is, in my opinion, inadequate to support the conclusion sought to be reached by the respondent Trust, the jurisprudence has generally been hostile to claims based on indirect, eligible uses when faced with direct but ineligible uses of borrowed money."
