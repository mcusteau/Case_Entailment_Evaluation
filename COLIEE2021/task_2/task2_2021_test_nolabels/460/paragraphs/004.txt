On the PRRA application form under the heading "Reasons for Applying For Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA)" Ms. Ferguson wrote "submissions to follow". Under the heading "Supporting Evidence" where she is asked to provide a list of the written documents included with the application that will "clearly act as evidence in support of your application for a Pre-removal Risk Assessment", two types of documents were listed, news articles and affidavits, which she indicated would support her requests for protection by providing "objective proof of risk". In fact, no affidavits were ever provided in support of the application. The news articles that were provided dealt with the treatment of lesbians in Jamaica but none specifically referenced Ms. Ferguson.
