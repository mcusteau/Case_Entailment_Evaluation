Counsel for both parties appeared to be of the same mind that, in the words of Respondent counsel, there is no principled approach to the issue of credibility versus sufficiency of evidence to be gleaned from these authorities. I do not share that view. Most of the cases to which the Court was referred were determined on the particular facts of the decision under review. In each instance the Court was required to make a determination as to whether, in the decision under review, "there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant's credibility", to use the words of section 167 of the Regulations. That, in turn, required an examination of the evidence before the officer and the officer's assessment of that evidence. I accept the submission of Applicant's counsel that the Court must look beyond the express wording of the officer's decision to determine whether, in fact, the applicant's credibility was in issue.
