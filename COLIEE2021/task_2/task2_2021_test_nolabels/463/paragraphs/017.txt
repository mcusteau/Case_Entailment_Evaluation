[17]
There may be circumstances in which the court would not allow an applicant his/her remedy when entitlement had been established because the respondent, though having notice of the proceedings, did not attend. This is not one of those cases, primarily because Mrs. Mindich is free to bring another application for citizenship at any time. This decision does not foreclose Mrs. Mindich's rights beyond the present application.
Appeal allowed.
