Interlocutory rulings are not ordinarily open to judicial review. The Federal Court of Appeal as well as this Court has clearly explained this principle and its supporting rationale time and again. In
ZÃ¼ndel v. Citron et al.
, [2000] 4 F.C. 255; 256 N.R. 125 (F.C.A.), Sexton J.A. stated:
"[ ... ] As a general rule,
absent jurisdictional issues
, rulings made during the course of a tribunal's proceeding should not be challenged until the tribunal's proceedings have been completed. The rationale for this rule is that such applications for judicial review may ultimately be totally unnecessary: a complaining party may be successful in the end result, making the applications for judicial review of no value. Also, the unnecessary delays and expenses associated with such appeals can bring the administration of justice into disrepute. [ ... ] (emphasis added)"
