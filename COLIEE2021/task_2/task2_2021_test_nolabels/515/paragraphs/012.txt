Special circumstances where, for example, the tribunal's very jurisdiction is at issue or where the impugned decision is "finally dispositive" of a substantive right of a party [see footnote 1] are necessary to justify judicial review of an interlocutory decision. Otherwise, an application to quash or vary an interlocutory decision will be considered premature.
