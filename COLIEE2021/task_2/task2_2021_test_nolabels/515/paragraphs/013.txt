Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association et al.
(2001), 270 N.R. 399, at para. 5 (F.C.A.). And this Court has also ruled that applications contesting interlocutory tribunal decisions regarding a summons and the production of documents were premature (see
Cannon v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Assistant Commissioner)
, [1998] 2 F.C. 104; 139 F.T.R. 91 (T.D.);

(2000), 198 F.T.R. 127 (T.D.)).
