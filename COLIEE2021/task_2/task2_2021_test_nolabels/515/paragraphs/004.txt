Subsequently, Mrs. Kahlon filed various applications to reside permanently in Canada: a post-determination refugee claimants in Canada ("PDRCC") application (now a pre-removal risk assessment); a first application for a visa exemption (which was denied in April 2001); an application for landing sponsored by her sister; a second application for a visa exemption sponsored by her second husband (which was granted); and, an application for landing after the visa exemption had been granted. Mrs. Kahlon did not attempt to be sponsored by her former husband, whom she divorced in 2000.
