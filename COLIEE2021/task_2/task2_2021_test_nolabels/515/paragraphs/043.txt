In my view, in the case of compelled evidence where "necessity" is in dispute, the RPD should inspect the documents itself first and then allow the respondent to examine only those documents that are found to be relevant to the application to vacate. As the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal stressed in
Wal-Mart
, ibid.:
"49 [ ... ] the proper procedure when there is a requirement to produce documents, whether by subpoena or otherwise, and there is a genuine dispute as to their relevance or as to whether they are privileged, is to have the documents produced, so that the tribunal charged with determining their relevance will have them available for examination. This is the procedure the Board intended to follow.
If any of the documents then turned out to be irrelevant, the privacy interest of the owner would be protected as the documents would not then be provided to the party making the demand, that is, there is no disclosure of the document to the Union
