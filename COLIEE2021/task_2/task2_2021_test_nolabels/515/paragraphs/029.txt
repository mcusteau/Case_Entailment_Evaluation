The reasons provided by the RPD for issuing the summons in question are, in their entirety, as follows:
"In accordance with the principles of natural justice, the tribunal considers that counsel is entitled to consult the documents pertaining to witness Pawen Kaur in order to be able to prepare and present a full response to the testimony she can be expected to give.
"The tribunal comes to this conclusion because of the very particular circumstances of this case, where the Minister's only witness is the daughter of the respondent. Her immigration status is linked to the central elements of her testimony. The immigration file could be critically relevant evidence for the respondent.
"The tribunal considers that counsel's reasons for requesting the summons establish the necessity of the evidence for a full and proper hearing."
