Taking these considerations as a whole, I think reasonableness simpliciter is the most appropriate standard of review. For judicial review to follow, the impugned decision must not be able to withstand a "somewhat probing" examination as the Supreme Court of Canada recently explained in
Ryan v. Law Society of New Brunswick
, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247; 302 N.R. 1; 257 N.B.R.(2d) 207; 674 A.P.R. 207:
"55 A decision will be unreasonable only if there is no line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. If any of the reasons that are sufficient to support the conclusion are tenable in the sense that they can stand up to a somewhat probing examination, then the decision will not be unreasonable and a reviewing court must not interfere. This means that a decision may satisfy the reasonableness standard if it is supported by a tenable explanation even if this explanation is not one that the reviewing court finds compelling.
