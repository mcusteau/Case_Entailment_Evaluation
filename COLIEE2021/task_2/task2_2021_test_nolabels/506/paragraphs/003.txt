I will address the alternative request first because I am not satisfied that the prerequisites for the granting of an extension of time have been made out. The conditions are delineated in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Hennelly
(1999), 244 N.R. 399 (F.C.A.). Neither Astra nor Takeda have provided evidence of a continuing intention to pursue the requested relief. The statement that "the jurisprudence fully supports the position that the appropriate rule to obtain increased costs is rule 403, rather than 397" does not, in my view, constitute a reasonable explanation for the delay and no other reason has been advanced. The
Rules
require that a motion pursuant to rule 397 be brought within 10 days after the making of an order. Taking into account the Christmas recess, the deadline for filing the motion was January 8, 2004. The motion was filed on January 26, 2004, and is out of time.
