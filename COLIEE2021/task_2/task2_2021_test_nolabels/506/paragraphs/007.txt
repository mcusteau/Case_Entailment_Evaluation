Astra and Takeda refer to
Baker Petrolite Corp. v. Canwell Enviro-Industries Ltd.
(2002), 23 C.P.R.(4th) 349 (F.C.A.) (
Baker Petrolite
),
Eli Lilly & Co. et al. v. Novopharm Ltd. et al.
(1998), 165 F.T.R. 316; 83 C.P.R.(3d) 31 (T.D.) and
Consorzio del Prosciutto di Parma v. Maple Leaf Meats Inc.
(2002), 297 N.R. 135; 22 C.P.R.(4th) 177 (F.C.A.) (
Consorzio
). They submit that in all three decisions, notwithstanding an order granting costs, the respective courts granted an order for fixed costs that departed from column III of Tariff B. Relying on
Consorzio
in particular, Astra and Takeda refer to the comment of the majority that "a motion under rule 403 must be considered a statutorily sanctioned procedure for the amendment or variation of a judgment". Accordingly, they argue that, following the noted jurisprudence and taking into account that the parties did not make submissions on costs, it is open to me to direct the assessment of costs on an increased scale pursuant to rule 403.
