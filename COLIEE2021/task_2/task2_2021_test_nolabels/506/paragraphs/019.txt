No one suggested that there was a novel issue of law to be determined. The proceeding did not involve issues that extended beyond the immediate interests of the parties involved. Astra's counsel's affidavit contains no specificity regarding the broad statement that he considered the matter to be complex from either a legal or a scientific perspective. I do not consider the submissions with respect to complexity to be compelling.
