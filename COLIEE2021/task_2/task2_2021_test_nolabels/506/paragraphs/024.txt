I am not so inclined with respect to Takeda's request. Takeda was concerned with only one of the four patents. It adopted the arguments of Astra regarding its patent and made additional submissions. While two counsel presented argument, in my view, it was not necessary to have second counsel to argue the "onus of proof" issue. This issue had been canvassed by Astra, and Takeda's supplemental submissions could have been accomplished through one counsel. While Takeda's counsel's attendance at the hearing was necessary until counsel was called upon to argue, Takeda required only 4.5 hours out of 4.5 days to present its submissions. I am not prepared to grant Takeda's request for second counsel costs.
