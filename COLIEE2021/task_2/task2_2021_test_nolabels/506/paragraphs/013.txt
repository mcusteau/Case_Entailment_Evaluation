Regarding the argument that my order ought to reflect the costs ordered by Madam Justice Dawson in relation to proceedings between the same parties and involving the same patents, I fail to see why this is so. As I understand it, there was no hearing on the merits in that matter. The proceeding was discontinued on the eve of the hearing and Justice Dawson, among other things, found that costs had been "thrown away". I consider that order to be discrete. It dealt with the particular set of circumstances existing at the time and is not analogous to the circumstances that are before me.
