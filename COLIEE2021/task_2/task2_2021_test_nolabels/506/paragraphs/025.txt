The request in relation to item 24 relates to travel expenses for Takeda's counsel to attend the cross-examinations of Dr. Rowe and Dr. Brennan and for travel expenses for counsel to attend the hearing. Genpharm does not take issue with the first request, but argues that the second should be denied because the Requisition for Hearing indicated that the "hearing should preferably be held in Toronto, although other cities such as Ottawa and Montreal are acceptable". Since Takeda did not dispute this choice of venue, Genpharm maintains that it should not be liable to Takeda for its travel costs. In my view, parties should not be penalized for indicating a willingness to be flexible. Two counsel were based in Toronto and one was based in Ottawa. It was inevitable that someone would have to travel. It is not unreasonable that Takeda's counsel be permitted to claim economy class airfare between Ottawa and Toronto as a travel expense for his attendance at both the cross-examinations of Dr. Rowe and Dr. Brennan as well as for his attendance at the hearing.
