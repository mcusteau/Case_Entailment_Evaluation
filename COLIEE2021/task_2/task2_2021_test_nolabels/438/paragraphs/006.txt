I agree with the Applicant that the Court must engage in the well-established pragmatic and functional analysis to determine the appropriate standard of review when judicially reviewing the decision of an administrative tribunal (
Dr. Q., Re
, [2003] S.C.J. No. 18; [2003] 1 S.C.R. 26; 302 N.R. 34; 179 B.C.A.C. 170; 295 W.A.C. 170; 2003 SCC 19). However, I cannot accept that, if this has already been done on an issue, it has to be done all over again. As can been seen from the review that follows of the jurisprudence on the standard of review in respect of IFA, a pragmatic and functional analysis and the case law supports a conclusion that the appropriate standard is patent unreasonableness.
