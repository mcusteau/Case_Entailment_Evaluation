[28]
In the Applicant's submission, the Board erred by having an overly narrow focus and not considering the nature of the danger Jews actually face in Ukraine. The Board's reasons ignore certain documentary evidence submitted by the Applicant and, in particular, documentary evidence that demonstrates that the basis for the threat to Jews in Ukraine comes from an extreme violent neo-Nazi fringe against which the state does not provide protection. The Applicant submits that no mention of this threat was made in the decision. In addition, the Applicant referred to the decisions of this Court in
Kraitman et al. v. Canada (Secretary of State)
, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1063; 81 F.T.R. 64 (T.D.) and
Katkova v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] F.C.J. No. 549; 130 F.T.R. 192 (T.D.), both of which cast doubt on the Ukraine's ability to protect its Jewish citizens and both of which were before the Board.
