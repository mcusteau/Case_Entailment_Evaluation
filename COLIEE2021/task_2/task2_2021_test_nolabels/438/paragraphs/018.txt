While the Board found a local absence of state protection in the Applicant's village, it did not find that this absence of state protection was part of a broader pattern in Ukraine. With respect to Kiev, the Board found that the Applicant would be able to avail himself of the protection offered all citizens in that city. The Board continued its reasoning by stating that the limited resources of the police in Ukraine is an economic issue, not an anti-Semitic one, and all people in Ukraine suffer because of these limited resources.
