I also note that in
Singh (Sukhpal) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] F.C.J. No. 1283; 173 F.T.R. 280 (T.D.), Tremblay-Lamer, J., conducted an analysis based on the pragmatic and functional approach in order to determine the standard of review of the Board's determination regarding whether the Applicant would face persecution if he returned to India. Her conclusion was that the appropriate standard is patent unreasonableness. As indicated above, the notion of IFA is inherent in this determination.
