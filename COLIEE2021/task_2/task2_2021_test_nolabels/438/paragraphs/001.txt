Snider, J.
: Mr. Sergiy Chorny (the "Applicant"), a citizen of Ukraine, arrived in Canada in March 2000 and claimed Convention refugee status alleging a well-founded fear of persecution at the hands of anti-Semitic groups and criminals by reason of race. In particular, the Applicant alleges that he has experienced incidents of mistreatment and harassment because he is Jewish and consequently a person in danger of being tortured or at risk of losing his life or of being subjected to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. In its decision dated September 12, 2002, a panel of the Refugee Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board ("the Board") rejected the Applicant's claims. The Applicant seeks judicial review of that decision.
