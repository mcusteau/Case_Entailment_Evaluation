Counsel for the respondent submitted that there was no irreparable harm, as there was no serious risk of persecution if the applicant were returned to Iran. Counsel for the respondent cited case law wherein, on somewhat similar facts, irreparable harm had not been found. In both
Bavi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 106 F.T.R. 153 (T.D.), and
Shahranpour v. Canada (M.C.I.)
[see footnote 4], the applicants were refugees from Iran who had been determined by the Minister pursuant to s. 53(1) of the
Act
to constitute dangers to the public in Canada; in both cases, this court found evidence of irreparable harm in the event of deportation to Iran to be lacking.
