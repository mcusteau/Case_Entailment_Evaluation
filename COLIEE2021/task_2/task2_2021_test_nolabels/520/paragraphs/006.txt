When the applicant's hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division opened on 28 March, 1996, the applicant was advised that the Minister had formed the opinion that he was a danger to the public in Canada. The appeal was dismissed by the Immigration Appeal Division for lack of jurisdiction by reason of the Minister's opinion. The applicant was thereupon arrested and detained for removal from Canada to Iran.
