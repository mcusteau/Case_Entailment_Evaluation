The balance of convenience, considering the risk of irreparable harm to the applicant, also lies in his favour. Although there will be an element of inconvenience to the respondent if this stay is granted, and I acknowledge that there is a public interest in having the respondent's duties under the
Act
fulfilled in a timely manner, I find the balance to lie in the applicant's favour. I note that while the deportation order was issued in respect of the applicant in November of 1994, the process which led to the issuing of the Minister's opinion was not implemented until September of 1995, and the opinion was not communicated to the applicant until 28 March, 1996. On the facts before me, I find that the balance of convenience lies in favour of the granting of a stay, until the application for leave and for judicial review has been dealt with.
