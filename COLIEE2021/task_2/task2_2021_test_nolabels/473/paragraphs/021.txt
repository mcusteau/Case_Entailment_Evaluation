The Board accepted that the Applicant injured himself in the 1990 cable-pulling incident. However, there was no medical evidence available to support the Applicant's subjective belief that he suffered a significant injury. The Board concluded that the 1991 running and snow-shovelling injuries also were not significant because they had been resolved with treatment and because, in the Applicant's 1994 Medical Examination for Release, his spine was described as normal.
