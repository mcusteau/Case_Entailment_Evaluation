The Respondent argues that, in reaching its decision, the Board properly weighed all of the relevant evidence: first, that the Applicant's 1991 injury, caused by running and snow-shovelling, was treated and resolved; second, that the Applicant's Medical Examination for Release indicates that his back was normal; and, third, that there was a 17-year gap between the 1991 injury and the pension claim. Moreover, the Respondent argues, the medical report from the Applicant's own witness, Dr. Lalonde, supports the Board's finding.
