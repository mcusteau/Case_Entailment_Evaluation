In
Nisbet v. Canada (Attorney General)
(2004), 260 F.T.R. 31; 2004 FC 1106, another pension application judicial review, Justice Beaudry is clear that the presumption is triggered only after the causal link is established:
"18. There is an onus on the Applicant to demonstrate a causal link between the alleged disability and his or her years of service with the RCMP.
Only after that causal link is established will it become necessary to consider paragraph 21(2)(a) and the presumption contained in 21(3)(a) of the
Pension Act
. That principle was confirmed by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Elliot v. Canada (Attorney General)
, 2003 FCA 298; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1060 (F.C.A.) (QL), at paragraph 23:
'The appellant reproaches the Judge below of having failed to deal specifically with the issues arising under paragraphs 21(2)(a) and 21(3)(f) of the
Act
. I agree with the respondent that unless the appellant succeeds on the first issue, i.e. whether there is a causal link between the lunch at CFB Borden and his IBS, there is no reason to deal with the issues arising under paragraphs 21(2)(a) and 21(3)(f). I therefore turn to the first issue raised by the appeal.'" (my emphasis)
