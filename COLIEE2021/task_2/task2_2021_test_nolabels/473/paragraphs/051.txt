The Applicant says that the Board was unreasonable to rely upon the earlier, in-service and release audiogram testing because that testing did not pick up his hearing loss in the way that his 2008 and 2009 tests did. He says that the earlier technology was not sufficient for the job. In other words, he says that, given that the 2008 and 2009 audiograms detected his slight hearing impairment, it is reasonable to assume that the impairment has existed since 1981 when the artillery round was detonated close to the trench in which he was situated, and that this initial injury was exacerbated by prolonged exposure to noise during his military service in the infantry and in the military band.
