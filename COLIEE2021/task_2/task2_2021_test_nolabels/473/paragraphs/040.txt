The Respondent argues that, pursuant to subsection 21(2)(a) of the
Pension Act
, an applicant must meet two conditions to qualify for a pension. First, he must suffer a disability that results from an injury. Second, the injury must arise from or be aggravated by the applicant's military service. It is not enough that the applicant was a member of the Canadian Forces and is now disabled. There must be a causal connection between the injury and the performance of military service.
