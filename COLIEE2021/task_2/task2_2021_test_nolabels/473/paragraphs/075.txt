It appears to me that the reasoning that Justice Hughes applied in
Krasnick
applies in the instant case. Mr. Lunn's situation would not meet the test set out in
Law
. Mr. Lunn has not been singled out for differential treatment; he has simply had his claim denied. The jurisprudence attests to the authority of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board to deny pension applications where causation has not been established. Moreover, the jurisprudence does not suggest that s. 21 of the
Pension Act
is discriminatory.
