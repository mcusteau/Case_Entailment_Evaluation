Because the Applicant concedes that he has no evidence that the earlier audiograms were inaccurate and failed to detect his hearing loss, he is really saying that the Board should have applied a presumption, based upon the 2008 and 2009 testing, that the earlier testing was inaccurate and that the hearing loss only detected in 2008 (14 years following discharge) should be linked to an incident which occurred in 1991 and which was then exacerbated by his exposure to further noise as an airframe mechanic and as a piper in the military band.
