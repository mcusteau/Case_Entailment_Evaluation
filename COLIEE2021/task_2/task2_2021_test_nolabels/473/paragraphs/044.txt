The Board accepted the audiograms as the best evidence of the Applicant's hearing condition up to the time of his release from military service. Under s. 39 of the
Veterans Review and Appeal Board Act
, the Board must weigh that evidence in the best light possible for the applicant, but this does not relieve the applicant of his burden to prove on the balance of probabilities that he suffered an injury during his service. See
Wannamaker v. Canada (Attorney General)
(2007), 361 N.R. 266; 2007 FCA 126;
MacNeill v. Canada et al.
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 1115; 151 F.T.R. 121 (T.D.), at paragraphs 21-22.
