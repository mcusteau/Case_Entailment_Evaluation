The Advocate submitted that the in-service audiograms, particularly the release audiogram, did not meet the desired standard as set out in the Veterans Affairs Canada Entitlement Eligibility Guidelines. The Board acknowledged this but stated that there was no evidence before it to indicate that the in-service audiograms were inaccurate. In the circumstances, they were the best available record of the Applicant's hearing condition throughout his service and at the time of his discharge. In the absence of evidence to discredit the audiograms, the Board accepted them as accurate.
