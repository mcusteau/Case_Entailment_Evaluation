The Board commented that an X-ray taken on August 2008 showed degenerative changes consistent with the Applicant's age of 53 years. It also considered new evidence: a medical opinion dated 20 October 2009, in which Dr. Bernard Lalonde said that he could not state "with certainty" whether the Applicant's lumbar disc disease is "a result of incidences occurring in the 1990's or whether it is just a natural aging process or brought on and extenuated (sic) by the fact that he is significantly overweight." The Advocate argued that because Dr. Lalonde could not specifically rule out the contribution made by the service-related injuries then, at minimum, partial pension entitlement was warranted.
