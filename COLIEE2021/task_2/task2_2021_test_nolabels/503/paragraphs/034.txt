The evidence is that Post Traumatic Stress Disorder is a psychiatric condition defined by six criteria set by the
American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
. The first criterion is that the person has been exposed to a traumatic event involving actual or threatened death or serious injury to the self or to others. The person's response involves intense fear, helplessness or horror.
