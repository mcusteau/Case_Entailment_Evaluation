[25]
Section 35(2) of the
Pension Act
provides that the assessment of the applicant's disability
shall
be based on the instructions and a table of disabilities made by the Minister for guidance to persons making those assessments. These instructions and table of disabilities are authoritative medical evidence and the Board can reject other medical evidence such as the psychological report of Dr. Furman where it conflicts. In the case at bar, it was reasonably open to the Board to reject Dr. Furman's psychological report on that basis. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Board's rejection of the psychological report as not credible was not patently unreasonable, and the Board did not err when it found no credible evidence establishing the applicant suffered from PTSD.
