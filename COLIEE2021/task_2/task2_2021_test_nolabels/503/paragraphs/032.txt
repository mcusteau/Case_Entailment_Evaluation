The Board's decision not to refer the applicant for another medical opinion was reasonably open to the Board in that the Board was satisfied that the medical evidence in the Veterans Affairs Canada Table of Disabilities, the Veterans Affairs Canada Entitlement Eligibility Guidelines and the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders provided the Board with conclusive medical advice with respect to the definition of PTSD as a psychiatric condition. On this evidence it was reasonably open to the board to conclude that the applicant did not have PTSD so that no independent medical opinion was necessary.
