Section 38(1) of the
VRAB Act
provides that the Board may obtain independent medical advice and may require the applicant to undergo any medical examination that the Board may direct. This statutory language is permissive, not mandatory. The Board is not obliged to obtain independent medical advice, and it is not under any duty to inform the applicant of which evidence the Board finds credible prior to rendering the Board's decision.
