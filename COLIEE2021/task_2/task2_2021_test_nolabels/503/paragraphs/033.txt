The applicant applied for a pension based on PTSD. The psychologist's report, which was obtained subsequent to the pension application, confirmed the applicant had PTSD. However, it was reasonably open to the Board to find that this report does not accord with the authoritative independent medical evidence about PTSD. If the applicant suffers from some other psychiatric condition, then he may apply for another pension based on proper medical evidence. Of course, he must prove that the disability arose out of, or was directly connected to, his military service.
