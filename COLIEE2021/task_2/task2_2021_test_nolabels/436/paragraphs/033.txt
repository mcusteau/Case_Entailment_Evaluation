In
King v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2005] F.T.R. Uned. A15; 2005 FC 774; [2004] F.C.J. No. 979, Justice John A. O'Keefe allowed the application for judicial review and returned the decision to the Board for redetermination, finding that the Board had only referred to part of the documentary evidence which supported its finding that state protection was available in St. Vincent. The Board had failed to refer to contrary evidence in the same document which showed that the authorities did not necessarily respond adequately to complaints of domestic violence. (See also:
