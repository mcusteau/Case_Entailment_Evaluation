The Board has not actually considered the testimony in respect of the lack of protection from the authorities in the specific case of Ms. Myle. Ms. Myle cited several cases of neighbors who made complaints to the police and were not provided any protection or redress. In the explanation of the Board, no indication had been given in respect of the alleged abuser whether he is still incarcerated nor whether he was, in fact, incarcerated for reasons of gender-related abuse. Recognizing that background documentation clearly demonstrates that, often victims, do not have an opportunity to obtain protection on a uniform basis; that, in and of itself, gives sufficient justification for consideration of the matter, to be at least appropriately addressed.
