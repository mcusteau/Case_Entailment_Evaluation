On April 14, 2000, Madam Justice Dawson allowed the Claimantsâ€™ motion and issued an interim injunction restraining and enjoining holding of the ratification vote until after June 30, 2000. (In a subsequent application in T-1707-02, Lonnie Dodge, moved for an interim injunction to further restrain the holding of the Settlement ratification vote until after the disposition of the proceedings in T-850-99 or T-1707-02. The motion was heard by Madam Justice Heneghan on January 13, 2003 and was dismissed on the basis that Mr. Dodge had failed to demonstrate that he would suffer irreparable harm.)
