Absent an acknowledgment by the Claimants that the Band Council would have succeeded if the proceedings had gone to hearing, the Court should not be speculating as to the likely outcome. Costs can be awarded, however, on the basis of the conduct of the parties during the course of the litigation, such as: (1) whether it was reasonable for a party to raise, pursue or contest a particular allegation or issue; (2) whether a party properly pursued or defended its case or a particular allegation or issue; (3) whether a party exaggerated its claim or raised a baseless defence; and (4) whether a party properly conceded issues or abandoned allegations during discoveries.
