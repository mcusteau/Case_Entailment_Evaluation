The Band Council submits that the Court should exercise its discretion pursuant to Rule 400 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998, SOR/98-106 (FCR) to make a cost award in its favour. It claims to be entitled to costs on the grounds that: (1) it was the successful party; and (2) the Claimants were vexatious and unreasonable in the manner in which they pursued the action, thereby requiring the Band Council to incur undue costs. The Band Council submits that the Claimants’ claims were unfocused, broad and chaotic. They also contend that the allegations made against the Band Council were abusive, vexatious and scandalous in nature and that the focus of the Claimants’ litigation was to attack members of the Band Council personally. As such, the Band Council submits, the Claimants’ conduct should be sanctioned by a substantial award of costs.
