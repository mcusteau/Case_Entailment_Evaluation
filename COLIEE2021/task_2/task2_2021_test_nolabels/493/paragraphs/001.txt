: By motion dated February 8, 2006, the Defendants in Court File No. T-850-99 and the Respondents in T-1707-02 (collectively referred to in these reasons in the singular as the Band Council) seek a lump sum award of costs of the proceedings against the Plaintiffs in T-850-99 and the Applicant in T-1707-02 (the Claimants), as well as against the Plaintiffs’ former solicitor on a substantial indemnity basis. In the alternative, the Band Council seeks directions that costs be assessed in accordance with the upper range of Column V of Tariff B and that those costs be doubled.
