Under Rule 400 of the FCR, the Court has discretion as to whether costs are payable by one party to another and the amount of those costs. In deciding what order, if any, to make on costs, the Court will generally have regard to all 14 factors which are listed in subsection 400(3): Francosteel Canada Inc. v. African Cape (The), [2003] 4 F.C. 284; 2003 FCA 119. The onus is on the Band Council to establish that there is a sufficient basis for the Court to conclude that an exercise of its discretion to award costs is warranted.
