The Band Council relies on comments of Justice Paul Rouleau in RCP Inc. v. Minister of National Revenue, [1986] 1 F.C. 485 (T.D.) (RCP) in support of its proposition that costs may be recovered even where the proceeding is settled. In RCP, Justice Rouleau determined that the applicant should not be denied its costs simply because they obtained the relief they sought in the form of a settlement. He concluded that equity dictated that the respondents should not be allowed to avoid paying costs by settling the matter when it becomes apparent that the applicant would be successful at a trial of issues. However, the respondents in RCP had conceded the relief sought by the applicant. The Claimants in these proceedings have made no similar admission or concession.
