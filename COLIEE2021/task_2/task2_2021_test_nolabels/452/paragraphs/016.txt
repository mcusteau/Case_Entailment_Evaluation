In
Toth
, supra, the Court of Appeal did grant a stay of a deportation order pending a determination of an application for leave to appeal to that court. I distinguish the circumstances in that case where, in addition to any personal inconvenience, difficulty or harm to the applicant, the court had uncontradicted evidence that deportation would lead to the likelihood of failure of a family business on which family members and others were dependent, a portion of which potential harm was irreparable and not compensable in damages. In this case there is no evidence that others are dependent upon the applicant Kerrutt.
