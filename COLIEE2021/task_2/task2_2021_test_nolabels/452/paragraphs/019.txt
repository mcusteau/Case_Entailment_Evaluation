For the reasons set out I am not persuaded that the court should exercise its discretion to grant a stay prohibiting implementation of removal procedures to effect the deportation order made against the applicant, if the respondent decides to proceed. Thus, the application for a stay of those procedures, pending consideration of the application for leave to seek judicial review, is dismissed.
Application denied.
