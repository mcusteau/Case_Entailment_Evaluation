On the afternoon of February 27 counsel for the applicant was advised by telephone that the respondent's officer responsible had considered the written humanitarian and compassionate submissions filed on behalf of the applicant and had found there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds to interfere with the deportation process. Counsel was also advised that the meeting scheduled for March 2 was to make arrangements and set a date for deportation of the applicant. In that telephone conversation counsel requested reasons or the basis for the finding of insufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds and in response was given some suggested inadequacies, though the officer engaged in the telephone discussion was not the one responsible for the decision. In fact, the decision was made on February 21, was not communicated to the applicant in writing and was only communicated through counsel on February 27. Still seeking reasons for rejection of the applicant's submissions, counsel for the applicant spoke by telephone with staff of the officer responsible for the decision, found that that officer had been away from the office for approximately a week, and it was suggested that she direct inquiries to the assistant manager of the unit, apparently acting in place of the absent responsible officer. As suggested to her, counsel arranged for the applicant's file with written humanitarian and compassionate submissions to be forwarded to the assistant manager for review and the following afternoon, February 28, counsel was advised that the assistant manager had reviewed the file and submissions and was in agreement that there were insufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations to warrant interfering with the deportation process. Again, counsel sought reasons or the basis of the decision but none were provided in the telephone conversation. At the subsequent meeting on March 2, which the applicant attended with counsel, representatives of his family and his employer, no opportunity was provided for discussion of humanitarian and compassionate considerations and the meeting was concerned solely with arrangements for the applicant's departure from Canada. He was served with a direction that he was to be removed from Canada on March 23, 1992.
