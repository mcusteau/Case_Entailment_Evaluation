The issues for determination in this matter are whether the circumstances warrant intervention by the court in granting a stay, on an interlocutory basis. Counsel for the parties were agreed that the basis for considering this matter is that set out by Heald, J.A., in
Toth v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1988), 86 N.R. 302 (Fed. C.A.). That standard requires that there be a serious issue to be tried, that there be irreparable harm to the applicant if the stay not be granted and that the balance of convenience favour the applicant.
