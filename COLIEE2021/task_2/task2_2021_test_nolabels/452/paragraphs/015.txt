Assuming for purposes of this application that a serious issue is to be tried, will the applicant suffer irreparable harm if the application for a stay is not granted? I have no doubt that the applicant will suffer serious personal inconvenience, and no doubt difficulty, should he be deported before the application for leave to commence proceedings for judicial review is determined. His family ties with his sisters and their families in Canada, which have apparently meant much to him in his rehabilitation from alcohol addiction and from incarceration, will be strained. He currently has regular employment in Canada and no job prospects if he is returned to Guyana. Nor does he have any immediate family there. It will be more difficult for him to communicate with counsel concerning his application for leave. Nevertheless, I do not believe these personal difficulties constitute irreparable harm, as serious as they may be for the applicant. He will not be returned to a country where his safety or his life is in jeopardy. If leave is granted on his application for judicial review, if the orders sought in that application are granted, and if the respondent on further review should determine that there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds for him to remain in Canada, the deportation order now outstanding and to be implemented on March 23, 1992, may also be questionable and it will not be beyond the imagination of the respondent to arrange to admit the applicant to Canada should he seek to return.
