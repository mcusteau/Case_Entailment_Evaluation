Written submissions were forwarded on January 30, 1992, under a covering letter from counsel who asked the reviewing officer to advise if he wished to meet with the applicant concerning the written submissions. On February 11, 1992, the applicant received a call-in notice for his attendance for an interview on February 25, 1992, and upon inquiry counsel for the applicant was advised that the written submissions had been received and would be reviewed before that scheduled meeting. Having heard nothing by February 20, counsel inquired again on that day and was advised that the written submissions had not yet been reviewed. At that time, on the initiative of the respondent's officers, the meeting set for interview of the applicant was postponed from February 25 to March 2, on the understanding of counsel that this would provide additional time to review the written submissions.
