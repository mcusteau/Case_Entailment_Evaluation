[57]
By this reference to the provisions of the
Pension Act
, I should conclude that the expression "in respect to service in such area" does not have the restricted meaning which was advanced by National Defence to the effect that pension coverage does not apply should a peacekeeper step one foot out of a designated area. Admittedly, the enactment is ambiguous but, with respect to contrary views, the provisions of the
Pension Act
, liberal and generous as they are, attract an equally liberal and generous interpretation of Vote 58A. In my view, no geographical limit is imposed. The enactment is meant to confer on a peacekeeper the status of a World War II combatant while his military service is in a designated area. As in World War II, when universal coverage applied, it should not matter one whit where the casualty occurs, as any World War II veteran will testify.
