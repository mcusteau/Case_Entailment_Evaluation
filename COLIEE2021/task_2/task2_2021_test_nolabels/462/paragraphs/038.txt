Under s. 4 of the
Crown Liability Act
, the plaintiff was precluded from suing the Crown in tort if the injury or disability was pensionable. Marceau, J., decided that the disability was pensionable. At p. 425, he states:
"Under the
National Defence Act
(R.S.C. 1970, c. N-4), military service is continuous and total and a soldier is at all times subject to the orders and instructions of his superiors. Plaintiff was moved to the National Defence Medical Centre and admitted on the instructions of his superiors, and the treatment he underwent was prescribed and administered at the request of his superiors. He was treated as a member of the military, by others in the military, in a military facility. I think it clear that the acts which he complains of were committed in connection with his military service and that the resulting disability on which his claim is based 'arose out of or was directly connected with such military service'."
