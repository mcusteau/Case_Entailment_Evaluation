In a further letter to the Commission, dated February 26, 1992, Col. Forster stated that he disagreed with the Commission's finding that a person in the applicant's position was entitled to a pension. On April 3, 1992, the Commission rendered a further amended decision. It stated that the injuries sustained by the applicant were "not attributable to service in a Special Duty Area (Syria)" and therefore not pensionable under s. 21(1) of the
Act
