The Board interpreted the Vote 58A of the
Appropriation Act, No. 10, 1964
and the
Pension Act
to mean that
"Injuries incurred on any other type of leave will be covered under s. 21(1) when the leave was taken within the Special Duty Area where the member was serving. Once the member leaves the Special Duty Area, the Board must conclude that he reverts to his s. 21(2) coverage as the special coverage appears to only be extended while the member is serving in the Special Duty Area in the circumstances of this case, Special Duty Area (Syria)."
