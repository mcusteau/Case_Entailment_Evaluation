Since the
Act
did not provide for the Commission to reverse its decision, it was "functus officio" when it decided to change the applicant's entitlement to pension. It follows that both the Entitlement Board and the Veterans Appeal Board were not properly seized of the matter. The case should then be sent back to the Commission.
