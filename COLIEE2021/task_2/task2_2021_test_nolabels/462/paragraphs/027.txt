The parties' opinion as to what the interpretation should be is as follows:
1. It is clear from Vote 58A of the
Appropriation Act
, that once an individual enters a Special Duty Area, the provisions in the
Pension Act
that apply to an individual who served in World War II also apply to the individual in the Special Duty Area until such time as his service ends in that Special Duty Area. For the applicant, that period was from June 5 to December 5, 1990, and his injuries were incurred during that posting. Vote 58A and the
Pension Act
should be read in harmony. Since the applicant was posted in a Special Duty Area, since s. 21(1)(f) explicitly excludes from pension entitlement certain types of leave, and since s. 10(5) of the
Veterans Appeal Board Act
and s. 108 of the
Pension Act
provide that in case of doubt the decision should favour the claimant, the applicant should be entitled to a pension.
2. The applicant was granted a 60 hour pass, which Canadian Forces policy deems to be duty time as opposed to leave time. Since the accident occurred during that 60 hour pass, the applicant's injuries which occurred while on duty are pensionable under s. 21(1).
