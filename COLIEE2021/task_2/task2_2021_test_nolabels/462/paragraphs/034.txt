Vote 58A refers to "in respect of his service", while s. 21(1) refers to "incurred during such military service". Reading both of these provisions in harmony, I must conclude that the applicant must have been in service in order to be eligible for a pension. What does being in "military service" imply or include? The
Pension Act
provides no helpful guide, as s. 3(1) defines the term as such:
"3(1) 'military service' or 'service' means service in the Canadian Forces or in the naval, army or air forces of Canada since the commencement of World War I;"
