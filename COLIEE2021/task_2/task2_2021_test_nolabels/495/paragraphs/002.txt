The applicant is a Tamil from Sri Lanka who fled with her two children, from the Jaffna area, first to Colombo and then to Canada. The Board concluded that the applicants had a well-founded fear of persecution in the northern part of Sri Lanka. The Board also found that the applicants should reasonably be expected to take refuge in Colombo and therefore were not Convention refugees.
