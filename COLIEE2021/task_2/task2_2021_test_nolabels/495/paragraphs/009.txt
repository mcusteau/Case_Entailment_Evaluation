It may be that, taken literally, the presiding member's words can be said to demonstrate prejudgment. In fairness to the presiding member, however, I think his words must be read in the context of his efforts to try to calm the applicant. I would take his words as expressing the view that whether or not others might consider the applicant to be an LTTE supporter, he personally could not conceive of such a decision being made. Also, he was trying to reassure the applicant that, in his view, she could return to Sri Lanka without difficulty. The statements, although made before the close of the evidence were made, close to the end of the proceedings, when the presiding member could be expected to have come to a provisional conclusion with regard to the evidence. That his mind was not closed would seem to be evident from his statement to the applicant that her lawyer would be making submissions on all issues. In the light of these considerations, I am reluctant to characterize the statements as evidence of a biased decision-making. In any event, since I have decided, for other reasons, set out below, that the decision should be quashed, I do not need to decide that issue.
