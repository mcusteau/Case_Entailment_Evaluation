For all the above reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed. The Adjudicator failed to consider the employer's intentions when he determined that the respondent's suspension was disciplinary in nature, and therefore applied the wrong test to whether he had jurisdiction over the respondent's grievance. The Adjudicator also ignored evidence suggesting that the respondent had in fact misled police. The matter will therefore be remitted to a different Adjudicator for re-determination on the merits. Costs are ordered against the respondent.
Application allowed.
