As discussed above, in light of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in
Dunsmuir
, supra, at paragraph 47, the appropriate standard of review of this aspect of the Adjudicator's decision is reasonableness:
"... In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law."
