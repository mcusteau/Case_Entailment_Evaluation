Both of these decisions were rendered in relation to the
PSSRA
, which, although it contained a similar provision concerning jurisdiction over disciplinary matters, did not contain a privative clause, which is included at section 233 of the
PSLRA
. In my opinion, therefore, the question of whether the Adjudicator erred in concluding that the matter was disciplinary, and that he therefore had jurisdiction over the issue, should be reviewed on the standard of correctness concerning the legal test to be applied, but on the standard of reasonableness when it comes to the application of the facts to that test, considering the recognized expertise of the PSLRB and the privative clause included in the
PSLRA
, which indicates that Parliament intended the PSLRB to receive substantial deference.
(2) Did the Adjudicator err when he concluded that he had jurisdiction over the respondent's grievance?
