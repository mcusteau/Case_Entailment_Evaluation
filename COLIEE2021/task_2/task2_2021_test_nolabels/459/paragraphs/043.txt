The respondent says that the Board did note that the applicant had siblings in Vanni, and the north, but argues that the siblings are not the reason why the Board found a valid IFA in Colombo.

The personal circumstances included the fact that Colombo was the place where the applicant resided prior to coming to Canada, that the applicant was educated in Sri Lanka at a time when English was one of the languages, and that she could receive medical care, and worship at the religious facility of her choice in Colombo.
