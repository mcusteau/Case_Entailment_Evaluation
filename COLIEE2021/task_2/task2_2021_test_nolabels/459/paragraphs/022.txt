[22]
The applicant raises a number of issues, and sets out for the Court's consideration, whether the issues, singly or in combination, are serious ones. The issues are as follows:
a. Did the Board err in determining that it was not plausible that the LTTE would demand an exorbitant sum from the Appellant, or would commit extortion on an elderly person in Colombo;
b. Is the test at law, for an IFA, different under s. 97(1)(b) of the IRPA;
c. Did the Board err in law or exceed jurisdiction or make errors of fact in relation to the IFA finding;
d. Did the Board err in finding that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear;
e. Did the Board err by failing to provide a separate analysis under ss. 97(1)(a) and 97(1)(b) of the IRPA;
f. Did the Board err in law vis-à-vis the test under s. 97(1)(b); and
g. Did the Board err in law vis-à-vis the test under s. 96 of the IRPA.
