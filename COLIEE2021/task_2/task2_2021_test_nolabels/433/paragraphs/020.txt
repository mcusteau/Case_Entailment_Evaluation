This Court ruled in Maldonado v. Canada(Minister of Employment and Immigration) [see footnote 3] that the sworn testimony of the claimant is presumed to be true, unless there is valid reason to doubt its truthfulness. The Board had credibility concerns with Mr. Aslam's material evidence that was not resolved in his favour. The Board found much of Mr. Aslam's testimony to be implausible, giving rise to enough reason to rebut the presumption of truthfulness on his part.
