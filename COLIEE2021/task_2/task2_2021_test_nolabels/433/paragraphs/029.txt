Mr. Aslam testified that the SSP persecuted him and his family and he fears they would continue to persecute them if they were returned to Pakistan. He testified that he received threatening phone calls. He also testified that a group of people allegedly belonging to the SSP set a fire in his factory one night and one employee died in the fire. One of the supervisors called him to tell him of the fire but no one called the fire brigade until he arrived and did it himself. The Board determined that such lack of action defies all logic on behalf of the employees. This was a reasonable conclusion. It was also reasonable for the Board to expect that Mr. Aslam would have inquired whether help had been called. The Board found that this evidence was lacking in credibility and determined that, on a balance of probabilities, these incidents never occurred. Based on the lack of logic of the story, this was a reasonable finding.
