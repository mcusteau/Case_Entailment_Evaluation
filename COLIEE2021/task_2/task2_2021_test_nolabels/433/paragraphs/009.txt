After the incident, the threatening phone calls increased. The callers told Mr. Aslam that he should not have involved the SSP in the matter and that he should retract his statement to the police. In January 1997, Mr. Aslam moved to Karachi and transferred his new jewellery business from Faisalabad to Karachi. His wife and children moved to her sister's place in Faisalabad. Once the business became established, they planned to join him in Karachi.
