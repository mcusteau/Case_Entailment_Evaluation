After they arrived in Canada in August 2001, the Aslam family still did not make a claim until September 18, 2001. When asked the reason for this delay, Mr. Aslam stated he was not familiar with the process. However, he has many family members in Canada and testified that he came to Canada in May 2001 to explore the alternatives in order to stay in Canada. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to expect that in doing so he would have discussed all alternatives with his family in Canada and explored the refugee process especially since Mr. Aslam testified that they were fleeing for their lives.
