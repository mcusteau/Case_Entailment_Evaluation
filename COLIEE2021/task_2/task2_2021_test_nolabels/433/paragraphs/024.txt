In Djouadou v. Canada(Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [see footnote 5], this Court ruled that the Board was entitled to take into account a delay in claiming refugee status. The Federal Court of Appeal has upheld that delay is an important factor to be considered, albeit not a determinative one. In Huerta v. Canada(Minister of Employment and Immigration) [see footnote 6], the court rules that delay in making a claim for refugee status is not a decisive factor in itself. It is, however, a relevant element that should be taken into account in assessing the actions of the claimant.
