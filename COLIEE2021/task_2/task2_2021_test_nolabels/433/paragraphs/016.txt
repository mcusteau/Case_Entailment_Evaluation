Because the Board did not find Mr. Aslam's testimony to be at all credible, it found that the allegations must be false. It concluded that the events alleged by Mr. Aslam did not happen and therefore found that he and his family are not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection.
The panel finds the evidence in this claim entirely untrustworthy and totally lacking in credibility and that, on a balance of probabilities, the incidents as described by this claimant, never occurred and, therefore, do not believe what the claimant has alleged in this claim.
