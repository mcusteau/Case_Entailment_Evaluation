In
Castellanos et al. v. Canada (Solicitor General of Canada)
, [1995] 2 F.C. 190; 89 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Nadon defined the fundamental principle of family reunification as follows:
"B. Family Unity as a Concept in Canadian Refugee Law
"The principle of family unity requires that persons granted refugee status should not be separated from their closest family members, particularly when a situation of dependency exists; it is a principle of togetherness."
In that judgment, Nadon, J., analyzed the principle of family reunion, including paragraph 3(c) of the
Immigration Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 (the
Act
) and some relevant paragraphs of the Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, having regard to the 1951 Convention relating to the status of refugees and the Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, 1967. He concluded that the principle of family unity does not relieve a claimant of the onus of demonstrating that he falls within the definition of "Convention refugee" set out in subsection 2(1) of the
Act
.
