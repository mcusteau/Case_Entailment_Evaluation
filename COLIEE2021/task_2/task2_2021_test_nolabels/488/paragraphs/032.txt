On my reading of the reasons of the Refugee Division, I am unable to conclude that the Refugee Division did in fact criticize the applicant for not claiming refugee status in Russia. In my opinion, it criticizes her instead for contradicting in her testimony a document that clearly confirms that she had the intention of claiming refugee status in Russia. I think the Refugee Division could reasonably find that the explanations provided by the applicant on this question were not reasonable and that this contradiction could undermine her credibility.
Did the Refugee Division, in finding a lack of credibility, err in failing to consider the cumulative aspect of the persecutions the applicant and her family members had suffered?
