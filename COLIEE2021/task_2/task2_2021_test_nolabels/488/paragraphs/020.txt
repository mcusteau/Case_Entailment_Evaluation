[20]
The applicant testifies that the Refugee Division based its decision on erroneous findings of fact made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it, particularly in respect of the applicant's credibility and the assessment of her fear of persecution:
(a) The Refugee Division found that the applicant had decided to leave Canada on August 6, 1999, after coming here in May 1999, although the applicant says she did not leave Canada voluntarily.
(b) The Refugee Division drew negative conclusions concerning the applicant's credibility in criticizing her, on the one hand, for not claiming refugee status in Russia while she was there in August 1999 and February 2000, while, on the other hand, the Division acknowledges that the applicant's son was justified in fearing persecution in Russia on the basis of his membership in the Caucasians as a Jew and Armenian.
(c) The Refugee Division, in finding a lack of credibility, failed to consider the cumulative effect of the persecutions the applicant and her family members had suffered.
