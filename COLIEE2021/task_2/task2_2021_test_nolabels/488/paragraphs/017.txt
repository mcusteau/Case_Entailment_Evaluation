The Refugee Division drew attention to the following contradictions and inconsistencies in finding that the applicant lacked credibility:
1. The applicant's story to the effect that she was unable to obtain help from the authorities is contradicted by the documentation, which indicated that she could obtain legal assistance in suing her persecutors;
2. In her account (PIF), the applicant writes that she was beaten in Tashkent on September 3, 1999, while the Department of Justice exhibit notes that this incident occurred on September 14, 1999;
3. The medical certificate notes that the applicant was hospitalized for 13 days, while in her testimony she says she was bedridden in the hospital for 10 days;
4. The applicant testified that she went to the lawyers' office the day she was released from the hospital, but the documents indicate that this was done the next day;
5. The applicant's conduct in returning at least twice to Uzbekistan, once to visit and care for her sick aunt, and a second time to pack her bags and say good-bye, is not compatible with someone who says she fears persecution;
6. The applicant testified that she did not intend to claim refugee status in Russia, although in a "[Translation] administrative law offence" report (Exhibit P-5) she explains that she "[Translation] wanted to appeal to the competent authorities in Moscow to request refugee status".
