The IRB found that the principal plaintiff and Astrid were persons excluded from the scope of the 1951 Convention under section 1(E) of the schedule to the
Act
. It gave the following grounds in support of its decision:
"- before going to Cameroon the plaintiffs, who left Rwanda in April 1994, passed through Zaire, where they stayed until January 1997, and through the Congo, where they stayed until June 1997;
"- the plaintiff obtained a provisional Cameroon residency card, which subsequently became temporary, and which was equivalent to a residence permit;
"- the four tests stated in
Shamlou v. Canada (M.C.I.)
(1995), 32 Imm. L.R.(2d) 135, which the IRB had to follow in assessing the fundamental rights of a claimant, were met in the case at bar:
- the plaintiffs could return to Cameroon legally, since they held a safe conduct: the plaintiffs could return to Cameroon if the female plaintiff renewed her residency card, which she had not done since arriving in Canada; despite the Cameroon law indicating that the residence card allowed them to leave Cameroon after obtaining an exit visa, the plaintiffs used a false passport to leave the country;
- Cameroon follows a policy of integration favourable to asylum seekers, the latter benefiting from the same advantages as nationals with regard to the exercise of a profession, education and other areas such as access to social services: the female plaintiff worked continually throughout her residence in Cameroon;
- it was admitted by the female plaintiff that her two children had access to education;
- the documentary evidence confirmed that social services were available in Cameroon and that they could be used by persons who were in their territory; the plaintiff did not file any evidence to the contrary;
"- the plaintiff admitted and confirmed to the tribunal that she had no fear of the Cameroon authorities; further, she did not leave Cameroon with her children until three months after the attack allegedly made on her residence; she continued working until she left and she did not have to live in hiding; her explanation that she did not want to alarm her children was unacceptable; and
"- the plaintiff stated that she had never left Cameroon before leaving for Canada, whereas she went to the Central African Republic from March 12 to 19, 1998, on a mission for her employer; her explanation that she did not think about it was unacceptable, and the fact of concealing this undermined her credibility; the event indicated that she could have left and returned legally to Cameroon without any problem."
