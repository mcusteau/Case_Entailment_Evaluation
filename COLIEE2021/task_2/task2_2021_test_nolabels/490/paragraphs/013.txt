When the plaintiffs arrived in Canada the female plaintiff had a residency card valid until March 2000. However, by leaving without an exit visa and using forged documents the plaintiffs lost their right to return to Cameroon (sections 12 and 32 of the applicable Cameroon legislation). Also, by staying outside of Cameroon for over 12 consecutive months the plaintiffs lost the benefit of the validity of the residency card (section 25 of the applicable Cameroon legislation), if there was any after their fraudulent departure. Even if the plaintiff had wished to return to Cameroon or tried to renew her residency card after July 1999 it would have been impossible to do so, in view of the provisions of the applicable Cameroon legislation.
