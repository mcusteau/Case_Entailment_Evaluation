In
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Choovak
(2002), 220 F.T.R. 127; 2002 FCT 573 (T.D.), Rouleau, J., noted that the proper time for determining the existence of the right to return to a country is not the date of the hearing, but the date of the application for admission to Canada:
"[37] I must admit I have difficulty with the respondent's submission since this would yield the manifestly absurd result that counsel may indefinitely postpone the hearing of a refugee claim so as to cause the residence status of the claimant to expire, thus rendering the exclusion clause of Article 1E of the Convention inapplicable. Article 1E must be read in a more purposive light so as to provide safe haven to those who genuinely need it, not to give a quick and convenient route to landed status for immigrants who cannot or will not obtain it in the usual way. I therefore fully agree with the Federal Court of Appeal decision in the
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration v. Mahdi
, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1623 (QL) (FCA) at para. 12, that 'the real question that the Board had to decide in this case was whether the respondent was, when she applied for admission to Canada, a person who was still recognized by the competent authorities of the United States as a permanent resident of that country'."
