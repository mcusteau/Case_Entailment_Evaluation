The IRB was right to rely on
Shamlou v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1995), 103 F.T.R. 241; 32 Imm. L.R.(2d) 135 (T.D.), to determine whether the plaintiffs had the fundamental rights associated with the holding of Cameroon nationality. At paragraph 35 of that case, Teitelbaum, J., listed the tests to be followed:
"Lorne Waldman in his text submits that Boards should apply section 1E with 'great caution'. He outlines four criteria that, in his opinion, the Board should follow in undertaking an analysis regarding the 'basic rights' enjoyed by an applicant. These four criteria are:
(a) the right to return to the country of residence;
(b) the right to work freely without restrictions;
(c) the right to study, and
(d) full access to social services in the country of residence.
"If the applicant has some sort of temporary status which must be renewed, and which could be cancelled, or if the applicant does not have the right to return to the country of residence, clearly the applicant should not be excluded under art. 1E.
