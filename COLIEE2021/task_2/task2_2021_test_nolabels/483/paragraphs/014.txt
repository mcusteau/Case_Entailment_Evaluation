On the second ground, the Board finds it not plausible that the LTTE would demand such a large amount of money, even if the applicant had children living abroad. The Board claims that there is no reliable evidence that the LTTE was extorting large sums of money in Colombo during the period of time alleged by the claimant, nor was there evidence that elderly Tamils were mistreated by any authority. The Board finds that the applicant's allegation of extortion is not supported by the documentary evidence. The Board finds that the applicant came to Canada to be with her children.
