By further undated correspondence sent by facsimile on January 31, 2001, the Commission provided the Respondent with a copy of the Applicant's submissions concerning the Investigation Report. The Respondent was given the opportunity to respond to the Applicant's comments, and did so in a letter dated March 6, 2001. The Applicant, in her reply to the Investigation Report, purported to amend her original complaint form by alleging that the discriminatory act occurred in May 1998. In the original complaint, the Applicant alleged that the act of discrimination occurred on August 11, 1997 and was ongoing. In her reply, the Applicant commented on the various headings in the Investigation Report and disputed the recommendation that the Commission not deal with the complaint on the basis of prejudice to the Respondent.
