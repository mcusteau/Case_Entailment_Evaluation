Mr. Love was hired by the Respondent in May 1998, to work as a team driver for a Mr. Judd. Mr. Judd, like the Applicant, owns his own truck but does not drive it himself. The Applicant learned about this in May 1998. She then made inquiries to find out if Mr. Love had gained what she described as the "required mountain experience" since leaving her employ. By October 1998, she found out that he had not. She then contacted the Commission. According to the Applicant, she "felt" that she had been denied a team contract with the Respondent as the result of sexual discrimination. She said that the Respondent did not hire Mr. Love because he was employed with a female truck owner.
