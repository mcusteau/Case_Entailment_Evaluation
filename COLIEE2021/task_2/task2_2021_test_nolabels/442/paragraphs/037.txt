In this case, the purpose of the legislative scheme of the
Act
as a whole is to prevent discrimination and provide redress when it does occur. However, the

recognizes, through several provisions which provide certain screening functions, that this purpose must be applied with certain limitations on which complaints will proceed to the Tribunal stage. Particular to the present situation, section 41(1)(e) reflects the concern that complaints are to be brought forward in a timely manner.
