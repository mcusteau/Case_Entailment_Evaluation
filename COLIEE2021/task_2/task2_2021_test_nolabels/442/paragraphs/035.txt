The issue arising in this case is whether the Commission committed a reviewable error in making its decision. This leads to consideration of the applicable standard of review. In
Cape Breton Development Corp.
, supra, the Court characterized a decision made under section 41(1)(e) of the
Act
as a discretionary administrative decision and said as follows at paragraph 15:
"It is well settled, as all parties agree, that decisions of the Commission under paragraph 41(e) are discretionary administrative decisions. Decisions of that nature are not readily set aside, and courts will not interfere, even if they might have exercised the discretion differently, where the discretion has been exercised in good faith, in accord with the principle of natural justice and procedural fairness, and where reliance has not been placed on considerations that are irrelevant or extraneous to the statutory purpose."
