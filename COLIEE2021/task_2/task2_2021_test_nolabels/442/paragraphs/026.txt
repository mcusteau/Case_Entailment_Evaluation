The Respondent says that where a complaint is filed more than one year after the occurrence of the alleged discriminatory act, the Commission must hold a "hearing" and exercise its discretion to decide whether the complaint should continue to an inquiry. The Commission is required to provide an opportunity to the employer to make submissions on why this complaint should not proceed further. Upon receipt of submissions from the employer and considering all the evidence before it, the Commission is to decide, in the exercise of its discretion, whether the complaint will proceed further: see

(1993), 60 F.T.R. 142 (T.D.).
