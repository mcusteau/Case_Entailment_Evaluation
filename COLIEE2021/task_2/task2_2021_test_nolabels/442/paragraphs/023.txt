First, the Respondent alleges that the Applicant has improperly introduced evidence in this application for judicial review that was not before the Commission. The Respondent refers to paragraphs 5, 6, 34 and 35 of the Applicant's affidavit filed in this proceeding. It says that these portions of their paragraphs should be struck out since it is well-established that only the evidence that was before the decision maker should appear on the record for the purposes of judicial review.
