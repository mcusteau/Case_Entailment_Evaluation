To the extent this application for judicial review raises any issue other than that of procedural fairness, a number of decisions of this Court have addressed the issue of the standard of review to be applied to a decision of the Commission about whether to deal with a complaint, notwithstanding that the complaint is based on acts or omissions which occurred more than one year before the making of the complaint. In those cases, the Court has concluded the applicable standard of review is patent unreasonableness.
