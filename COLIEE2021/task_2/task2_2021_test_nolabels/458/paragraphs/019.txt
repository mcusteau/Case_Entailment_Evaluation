[19]
In my opinion, the appropriate disposition of this case would be to quash the decision of the Appeal Board in so far as it denied disclosure of confidential information to the applicants' representative and remit the matter to the Appeal Board to deal with the question of confidential information in the following manner:
1. To reconvene the proceedings and to satisfy itself, having regard to all considerations that the Appeal Board considers relevant, whether the confidential information in this case could be disclosed to the applicants' representative.
2. If the Appeal Board concludes that disclosure may be made to the representative, to proceed to make an order for such disclosure with such conditions as it considers necessary in the circumstances, but not such as to preclude the representative from fully and freely working with the registered psychologist who is retained, in the preparation of evidence and the presentation of such evidence.
3. If the Appeal Board concludes with reasons, that disclosure may not be made to the representative, based upon a reasonable and proper exercise of its discretion, to offer the applicants the opportunity of retaining a different representative who would be entitled to disclosure of the confidential information, subject to the same conditions as referred to in (2) above.
Order accordingly.
