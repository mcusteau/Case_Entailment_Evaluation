I have concluded that there has been a denial of procedural fairness in this case. In its September 16, 1992 ruling, the Appeal Board seems to have formed the conclusion that the test for disclosure should be whether the recipient of the information has a need to know the information and the capacity to make sense of it. In the Appeal Board's view, this would be an expert in the field whose evidence would carry weight before an appeal tribunal. While this decision is not objectionable as far as it goes, the fact that it goes no further indicates that the Appeal Board ignored the role of counsel or representative at the hearings.
