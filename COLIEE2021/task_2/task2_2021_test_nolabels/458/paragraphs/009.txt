Ms. Giffin issued her interlocutory disclosure ruling on September 16, 1992. The ruling stated in part:
"Access to the Supervisory In-Basket Exercise, in my opinion, should be restricted only to those persons with a need to know and the capacity of make sense of it. This means, in effect, that the test information should be disclosed to an expert in the field of testing chosen by the appellants who can report on his or her findings to their representative and whose opinions will carry some weight as evidence before an appeal board. Unlike the situation in
Ruskoff
, 92-CAE-0020 (Rosenbaum), the exercise information in the instant case appears to be of little use to persons without training in the interpretation of the test results. The department's condition that the expert be a certified or registered psychologist is a reasonable one in that it provides an element of professional accountability which renders it even less likely that confidential information will be improperly disclosed.
"The department appears to limit its offer of disclosure to a registered psychologist retained by the Public Service Alliance of Canada and only in those circumstances where there is a challenge to the validity and reliability of the Supervisory In-Basket Exercise, however, I find that offer unduly restrictive and would extend it to cover access to the actual test taken by the appellants and the correction grid or key employed in determining their results. And, I see no reason for distinguishing between the appellants' retaining the psychologist in their own right and the Alliance doing so.
"Accordingly, it is my ruling in response to the appellants' motion, that the department must disclose the information requested to a person nominated by the appellants' representative; providing, first, that the person shall be a nationally or provincially registered or certified psychologist expert in the field of testing, and, secondly, that the person will undertake to comply with all reasonable departmental guidelines for the handling of the information to be disclosed."
