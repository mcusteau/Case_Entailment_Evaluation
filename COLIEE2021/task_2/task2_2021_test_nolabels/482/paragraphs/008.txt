The particular issue which has given rise to conflicting opinions in this court is the construction of the residency requirements. Should the requirement that the applicant have accumulated three years of residence in Canada in the four years immediately preceding his application be construed as requiring:
1. that the applicant has been physically present in Canada for at least 1095 days in the four years immediately preceding his/her application (
Harry, Re
, [1998] F.C.J. No. 189; 144 F.T.R. 141 (T.D.)); or
2. that the applicant must have centralised his mode of living in Canada for at least three years prior to his application, notwithstanding that he may have been out of the country for more than one year in the immediately preceding four years?
Papadogiorgakis, Re
, [1978] 2 F.C. 208 (T.D.).
Judges of this court have chosen to adopt one or the other of these positions, according to their best judgment. Judges of the Citizenship Court, on the other hand, have generally tended to adopt the less restrictive view in
Re Papadogiorgakis
, supra. In those cases where the Minister appeals the decision of the Citizenship judge on the issue of the residence, the outcome may well depend upon which of these two approaches the judge hearing the matter has adopted.
