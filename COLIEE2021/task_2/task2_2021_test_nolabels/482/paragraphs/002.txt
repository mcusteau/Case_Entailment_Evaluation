The facts are relatively straightforward. In 1989, 1991, and 1992 Mrs. Mindich came to Canada as a visitor to visit her son and her grandchildren. In 1994 she came as a landed immigrant. When landing in Canada she lives in rented accommodation in Toronto which she maintains while she is away. She maintains a bank account which shows a pattern of deposits sufficient to pay her rent but little other activity. She has filed an Income tax return for the 1997 taxation year in which her only income was her foreign pension income. She has a Social Insurance number and a health services card. She has a son and grandchildren in Canada.
