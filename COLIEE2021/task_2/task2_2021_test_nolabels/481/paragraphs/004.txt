In its notice of allegation, Apotex autho­rized SmithKline to refer to excerpts of its abbreviated new drug submission and the drug master file produced in other proceed­ings. However, those documents previously produced by Apotex did not contain "... the detailed description and quality control information pertaining to the method of manufacture of its paroxetine hydrochloride". As a result, SmithKline alleged that the information previously produced was insuffi­cient to determine whether the allegation of non-infringement is justified in the present proceeding.
