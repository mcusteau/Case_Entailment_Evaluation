Counsel for the Minister submitted that the making of an order under s. 6(7)(a) need not necessarily result in the making of an order against the Minister under s. 6(7)(b). In other words, he characterized the making of an order against the Minister as "an additional or supplementary remedy". He further submitted that the court ought not to make such an "additional or supplementary order unless satisfied, on appropriate grounds, that the order is necessary". In order to establish that verification is necessary, he submitted that the applicant should be required to establish "... that material differences may exist" between the documents produced and the information filed with the Minister in the submission for a notice of compliance. Counsel for the Minister cited no authority to support any of his submissions.
