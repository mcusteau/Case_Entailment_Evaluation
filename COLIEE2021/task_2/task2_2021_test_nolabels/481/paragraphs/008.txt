Although I have not summarized all of the evidence adduced by the parties on the motion, I have nevertheless carefully con足sidered all of it in arriving at my decision. In my opinion, SmithKline has established on a balance of probabilities that disclosure of the full process for the manufacture of Apotex' paroxetine hydrochloride is required to provide a proper evidentiary foundation for assessing the allegation of non-infringement in relation, at least, to the product by process claim in claim 5 of the '023 patent. I also note that the evidence of Dr. Fallis that it would be "important", in determining the question of infringement, to assess the fur足ther processing done by Apotex after the re-crystallization step revealed in the disclosed materials was not undermined in cross-exam足ination. Apotex shall therefore produce to SmithKline pp. 6 to 19 of the drug master file of its wholly owned subsidiary Brantford Chemicals. Those pages of the drug master file constitute a portion of the submission for a notice of compliance for the drug paroxetine hydrochloride filed by Apotex with the Minister and are relevant to the disposition of the issues raised in the pro足ceeding.
