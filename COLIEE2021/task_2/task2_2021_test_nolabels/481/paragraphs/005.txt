In support of its motion, SmithKline adduced affidavit evidence from an expert in chemistry, Dr. Alexander Fallis, a professor of chemistry at the University of Ottawa. In his affidavit, Dr. Fallis stated, among other things, that Canadian Letters Patent No. 1,038,390 ("'390 patent") contains a generic claim covering a large number of compounds, including paroxetine hydro­chloride, but that it "... does not spe­cifi­cally disclose the existence of paroxetine, let alone paroxetine hydrochloride, let alone a par­ticular polymorphic form of paroxetine hydrochloride". As a result, the allegation that Apotex would only use paroxetine hydrochloride in the form disclosed and claimed in the '390 patent revealed "nothing" to Dr. Fallis about the form of paroxetine hydrochloride made by Apotex, "... as there is no form of paroxetine hydrochloride dis­closed in the '390 patent". Dr. Fallis also examined a synthetic scheme outlined in the portion of the drug master file disclosed to SmithKline, together with the disclosed portions of the abbreviated new drug sub­mission and the teachings in Canadian Let­ters Patent No. 2,210,023 ("'023 patent"). In short, he concluded that there must be fur­ther processing steps after the re-crystalli­zation step in the synthetic scheme included in the materials provided to SmithKline. In order to determine the question of infringe­ment of the '023 patent, Dr. Fallis was of the opinion that it would be "important to know" what further processing was done by Apotex after the re-crystallization step in the synthetic scheme outlined in the disclosed portion of the drug master file.
