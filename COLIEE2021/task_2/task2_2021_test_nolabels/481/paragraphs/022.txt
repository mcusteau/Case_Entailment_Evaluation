As the second branch of his argument, counsel for the Minister submitted that, prior to making an order for verification under s. 6(7)(b), the applicant should be required to establish that material differences may exist between the information produced and the information filed with the Minister. I cannot accept that submission on the basis that s. 6(7) contains no such test, and I see no reason to read those words into the legislation. Furthermore, the position advanced by the Minister is completely inconsistent with the underlying legislative intention in s. 6(7) to reduce unnecessary litigation. Indeed, the interpretation urged by the Minister would have the undesirable effect of requiring an applicant to establish on a motion that material differences may exist between the information produced and the information in the submission for a notice of compliance. In litigating that issue, affidavits would be filed, cross-examinations would be conducted, other motions would perhaps be brought concerning refusals on cross-examination and a hearing would be held. In other words, the parties would be required to engage in time-consuming litigation for the sole purpose of ensuring that the court has the proper material before it to dispose of the substantive questions raised in the proceeding. The interpretation proposed by the Minister simply cannot be consistent with the legislative intention of reducing litigation. It is also not consistent with the express wording of s. 6(7), when considered in its entire context.
