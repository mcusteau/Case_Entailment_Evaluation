In opposing the motion brought by SmithKline, Apotex tendered evidence from Dr. Barry Sherman, the Chair of Apotex. In his affidavit, Dr. Sherman stated, among other things, that Apotex placed no reliance in its notice of allegation on the process used to make its paroxetine hydrochloride. He also noted that the claims of Canadian LetÂ­ters Patent No. 2,168,829 ("'829 patent") are all product claims for paroxetine hydrochloride in its anhydrate form, and that the only relevant claim in the '023 patent is claim 5, a product by process claim for paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrate. During the course of his cross-examination, Dr. Sherman stated, among other things, that only the final product or form of the paroxetine hydrochloride was relevant to the allegation made by Apotex, as opposed to the process for making the product. He also emphasized that Apotex was using the prior art teachings of the '390 patent in making its form of paroxetine hydrochloride, and was therefore not infringing the '829 or '023 patents.
