It can be seen from reading the transcript, at p. 44, that the panel indicated to counsel for the applicant that he did not have to make submissions on changed circumstances:
"Because now we don't know even if P.P.P. obtained more seats than other parties in the elections of yesterday. It's conjectural for us to say what's going to happen tomorrow, how things are going to work and how, in French we would say, 'stable' ... Yes, that type of stability will come out in the next month ... I just wanted to specify this so that Ma√Ætre Lebrun would not have to make submissions on change of circumstances in his submissions."
