Although the Refugee Division questioned the applicant's credibility on certain points, it decided that his fear of persecution was invalid for the following reasons. First, the P.P.P. had come to power in Pakistan, eliminating the possibility he would be persecuted for his political activities. Second, his fear of the I.S.I. [sic] thugs was groundless since he was able to live in his village between April and November 1992, while engaging in political activities, without being bothered by the I.S.I. [sic]. Finally, in the event the applicant was required to testify against the I.S.I. [sic] in a trial for the murder of his uncle and cousin, the Refugee Division concluded he could still obtain protection from the government against reprisals.
