In 1990 the President of Pakistan dismissed the P.P.P. government and called general elections. The applicant was once again involved in the electoral campaign. On election day thugs attacked the P.P.P. office and killed his uncle and two other members of the party. The police conducted no investigation into these murders, and this led to demonstrations on November 2, 1990. At those demonstrations the applicant was arrested and held for ten days by the police, then released. Subsequently, in January 1991, the applicant was appointed general secretary of the section of his party and his cousin was elected president.
