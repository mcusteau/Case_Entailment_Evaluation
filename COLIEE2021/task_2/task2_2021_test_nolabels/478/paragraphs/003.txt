The Court has the jurisdiction to award a lump sum for costs under Rule 400(4) of the
Federal Court Rules
. In
Barzelex Inc. v. M.V. Ebn Al Waleed et al.
, [1999] F.T.R. Uned. 930; [1999] F.C.J. No. 002 (T.D.), at para. 11, Hugessen, J., stated that "[i]n my view, as a matter of policy the Court should favour lump sum orders. It saves time and trouble for the parties and it is a more efficient method for them to know what their liability is for costs". See also:
