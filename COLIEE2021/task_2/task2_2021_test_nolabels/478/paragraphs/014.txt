, [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 305; 2006 FC 476; [2006] F.C.J. No. 603, at para. 9 the Court made it clear that double costs would not be awarded under Rule 420(2)(a) where the conditions precedent set out in that rule had not been met. This portion of the Rule deals with a defendant's offer to settle, and has the same two requirements as Rule 420(1) as stated above.
