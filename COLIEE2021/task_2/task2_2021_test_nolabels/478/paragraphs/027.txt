I am satisfied that I can take into consideration the defendant's failure to adequately respond to several notices to admit prior to trial. While defendant's counsel took me to several examples of requests for admissions that were more properly within the Court's domain as questions of claim construction, that does not explain why the bulk of the admissions sought were either summarily dismissed or ignored, requiring that the plaintiff tender evidence that would not otherwise have been required. For example, evidence relating to admissions made by the defendant's expert, Dr. Barudi, in the U.S. proceedings did not need to be proved at trial and would have reduced the scope of the Phillips' affidavit. Information respecting the schedule of trade shows attended by both parties was within the defendant's knowledge and should not have required preparation and testimony. Further, particulars respecting the employment by CFM of one Colm Martin should have been admitted.
