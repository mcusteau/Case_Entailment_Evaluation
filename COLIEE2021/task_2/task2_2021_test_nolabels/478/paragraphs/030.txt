Dimplex also put forward two alternate proposals for calculating its fees on a party and party basis if the solicitor-client approach was rejected. In each, Dimplex proposed that the portion for fees be determined at the top of Column V and that disbursements be fixed at $250,000. In the first alternate proposal, the fees from the date of its last settlement offer to the conclusion of the trial would be tripled for a total lump sum of $0.53 million. In the second proposal without tripling, the total requested comes to $0.41 million. Dimplex also requests that the costs of this motion be ordered payable forthwith in the amount of $3,000.
