[29]
At the hearing of this motion, in response to CFM's objections to the plaintiff's initial submissions, Dimplex put forward an amended proposal calling for a lump sum award of $1.35 million. That included Column V fees at $100,000 from commencement of the action to March 28, 2005, solicitor-client costs from that date to the end of the trial of $1 million and $250,000 in disbursements.
