It is difficult to assess what is a reasonable disbursement for a winning expert in a patent case. Mr. Phillips charged the plaintiff $150,000 for his fees. I am assured by counsel that this does not reflect any part of Mr. Phillips' role in the U.S. proceedings. The defendant suggests that $75,000 would be more appropriate. I have taken both submissions into account in arriving at my determination of the lump sum.
