In the present case, multiple offers to settle were made by Dimplex. These constituted genuine attempts to reach a compromise. At the outset, the action could have been easily resolved with each party bearing its own costs if CFM had been prepared to alter its use of the infringing screen technology. After Dimplex had succeeded at trial in the U.S. proceedings in March 2005 and was awarded damages of $8.3 million, Dimplex offered in writing to settle both the U.S. and Canadian actions for $7.2 million, a substantial saving for CFM. The U.S. District Court subsequently increased the award to $12.4 million because of the jury's finding of wilful infringement. Dimplex then offered in writing to settle both actions for $10 million payable over two years, and again, on the eve of the trial in this action, for $9 million. Each of these offers would have resulted in substantial savings to CFM.
