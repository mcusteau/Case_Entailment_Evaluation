The difficulty with Mr. Hoffman is that, in addition to not having been called, there is little before me as to why he was necessary or to prove his fees. The plaintiff asserts that he was retained to reply to potential defence evidence that was never called. The defendant argues that his expert opinion would have been based at least in part on survey evidence that I declared inadmissible at trial. In the circumstances, I consider it prudent to disregard the claim for Mr. Hoffman's services.
