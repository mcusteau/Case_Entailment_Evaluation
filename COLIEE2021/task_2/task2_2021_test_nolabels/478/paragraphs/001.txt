Mosley, J.
: On May 11, 2006 in
Dimplex North America Ltd. v. CFM Corporation
, 2006 FC 586, I determined that Dimplex was entitled to a declaration that its Canadian Patent No. 2,175,442 (the â€˜442 patent), entitled "Flame Simulating Assembly", was valid and that it had been infringed by CFM Corporation. I further found that there had been a "deliberate appropriation of intellectual property" by CFM, but that "it did not amount to conduct of such high handed, callous and oppressive nature as to offend the Court's sense of decency". As a result, I denied Dimplex's claim for aggravated, exemplary or punitive damages. At the conclusion of the Judgment I noted that costs would be spoken to by way of notice of motion.
