The applicant sought a reconsideration of this decision by the Board. Reconsideration was sought on the ground that the panel had erred in concluding that the medical evidence simply raised a possibility that the incident caused his condition. The applicant noted that the medical reports he had filed had used the word "probably". He argued that any doubt about his claim should therefore have been resolved in his favour. The applicant referred particularly to Mr. Justice Teitelbaum's decision in
MacKay v. Canada (Attorney General)
(1997), 129 F.T.R. 286 (T.D.). That decision dealt with an individual who claimed a disability pension as a result of a whiplash injury that had occurred 30 years prior to the initial medical evidence that was relied upon.
