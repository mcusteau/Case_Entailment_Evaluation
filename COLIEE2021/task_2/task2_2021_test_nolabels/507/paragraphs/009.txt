As noted, the Minister's decision of September 4, 1996, refused the applicant's application for a disability pension. It reads in part:
"A review of your service documents did not reveal any complaints or abnormal findings with regards to your neck during your period of service with Reserve Force Service. There were no Reports on Injury documented during your period of Reserve Force Service.
"The first indication of a neck problem was recorded on a Physician's Statement dated January 1996 that recorded a diagnosis of arthritis of neck.
"
With no documentation of a Report on Injury or any neck complaints recorded during your Reserve Force, the Department has concluded that your cervical disc disease diagnosed in 1996, is post discharge in origin
and therefore not pensionable under s. 21(2).
. . . . .
"In making its decision, the Department has considered and applied the provisions of s. 5(3) which provides that any doubt in weighing uncontradicted, credible evidence presented shall be resolved in the applicant's favour." (underlining added)
