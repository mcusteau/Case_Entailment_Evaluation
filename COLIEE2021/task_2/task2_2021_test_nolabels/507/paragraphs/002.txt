The applicant filed an application for a disability pension with the Department of Veterans Affairs on October 19, 1995. That application was refused by the Minister on September 4, 1996. An entitlement review hearing was held by a review panel of the Veterans Review and Appeal Board on January 22, 1997; the application for the pension was refused. An entitlement appeal before an appeal panel of the Board was held on June 9, 1997; the refusal was confirmed. The appeal panel of the Board reconsidered its June 9, 1997 decision on September 5, 1997. That reconsideration again resulted in the refusal of a pension. It is that decision to which this application relates.
