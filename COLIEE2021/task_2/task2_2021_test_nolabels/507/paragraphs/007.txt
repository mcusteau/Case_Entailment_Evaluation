The earliest available medical report presented to the Board to establish the applicant's condition is that of a chiropractor, Dr. D. Pietrangelo. He prepared a statement on January 11, 1996, containing the diagnosis: "Chronic cervical strain resulting in mechanical neck pain from joint dysfunction and associated muscle spasm". This was followed by a written report, dated December 19, 1996. The applicant states that Dr. Pietrangelo filed the 1992 x-rays with his report and these were subsequently returned. The December 1996 report reads as follows:
"Further to my report of findings as regard Mr. Hall dated January 11, 1996. In my opinion this patients cervical disc disease condition which results in chronically recurring symptoms
is the result of an old 'whiplash' type injury to the neck and would have occurred at least 10 years ago
.
"Other than the neck injuries sustained while on Reserve Force activities, Mr. Hall denies any history of neck trauma, i.e., motor vehicle accidents, falls, etc. This being the case
I would therefore assume that the patient's neck condition is probably the result of his fall and injury while serving in the Reserve Force in the winter of 1983-1984
