The applicant states that he did not seek medical attention for his injury until 1987-1988, that is four years after the accident. He states that his family physician took x-rays at that time but these x-rays were not available at the time of his application for a pension in 1995. X-rays were also apparently taken in 1992, by a chiropractor that was then treating the applicant. The applicant states that he has these in his possession and they were presented to the Board.
