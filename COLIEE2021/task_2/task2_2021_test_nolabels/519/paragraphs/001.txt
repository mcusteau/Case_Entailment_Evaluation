Reed, J.
: The application brings a motion for an extension of time pursuant to rule 5(2) of the
Federal Court Immigration Rules
. The extension is sought to enable the applicant to commence a proceeding under s. 18 of the
Federal Court Act
to challenge a decision of the Minister. The decision in question was rendered in early August, 1989. The Minister refused to grant the applicant landed immigrant status on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. (s. 114(2) of the
Immigration Act
). On August 30, 1989, Mr. Justice MacKay granted the applicant leave to commence a s. 18 application to challenge this decision but refused to issue a stay of the deportation order which at that time was outstanding against the applicant.
