On becoming aware of what had happened, the applicant's counsel asked immigration authorities to now review the applicant's case to see whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds for granting landed immigrant status existed. Officials agreed; this was in September, 1990. Although it is not part of the affidavit material on the record, counsel for the respondent advised me that immigration officials had been willing, since September, to do such a review but that representations on the applicant's behalf had not been presented to them. Counsel for the respondent indicated that the Minister is still willing to undertake such a review if representations with respect thereto are forthcoming from the applicant. In any event, in the absence of appropriate initiatives from the applicant, pursuing his request for a review, officials notified the applicant on January 31, 1991, that arrangements were being made for his deportation.
