It is abundantly clear that the applicant has not made out a case justifying an extension of time pursuant to rule 5(2). His counsel argues that the applicant, in August - September of 1989, lost contact with his lawyer and therefore never knew about the August 30, 1989 decision of Mr. Justice MacKay. This is not a compelling argument. Individuals in the position of the applicant, have some obligation to keep in touch with their counsel or their counsel's firm, if the particular counsel in question leaves that firm. An individual has a responsibility to take initiatives and actively pursue the claims being made. It is not sufficient to place oneself in a position where communication is difficult or nonexistent and then plead lack of knowledge of what occurred, as a grounds for seeking an extension of the time limits.
