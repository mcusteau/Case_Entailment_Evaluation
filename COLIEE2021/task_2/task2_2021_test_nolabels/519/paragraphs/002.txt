When leave to commence a s. 18 application has been granted the application must be filed within 15 days of the order granting leave. Subsection 82.1(5) of the
Immigration Act
reads:
"Where leave under this section to commence a proceeding is granted, the proceeding shall be commenced within fifteen days after the granting of leave."
In a letter to the Court dated September 8, 1989, the applicant's then lawyer, a Mr. Azevedo wrote:
"Unfortunately, I am unable to receive instructions from my client. I will advise the court accordingly."
Section 18 proceedings were never commenced.
