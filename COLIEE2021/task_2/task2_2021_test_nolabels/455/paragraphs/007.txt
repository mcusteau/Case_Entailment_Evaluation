However, in the present situation, the decision at issue is one that is essentially factual, as the citizenship judge was asked to determine whether the applicant had sufficient knowledge of Canada, as opposed to determining whether the applicant met the residency requirement based on the tests set out in the jurisprudence, which would be a question of mixed fact and law. Therefore, I would follow the decisions of Mr. Justice Michel M.J. Shore in Abdollahi-Ghane v. Canada (Attorney General), 2004 FC 741, and Mr. Justice Richard Mosley in Huang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 861, to the effect that greater deference should be shown to the citizenship judge for pure questions of fact and that the standard of review should be patent unreasonableness.
