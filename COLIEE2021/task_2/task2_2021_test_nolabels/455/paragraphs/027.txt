However, it remains that becoming a Canadian citizen is a great privilege and that, in order to fully exercise the rights and responsibilities associated with citizenship, one is required to have a basic knowledge of Canada. The applicant has only been in this country since 2001, and already she has made a lot of progress in that respect, but not enough to meet the requirements of the Act. I have no doubt that her knowledge will continue to improve with the help of her family, so that when she is ready to re-apply for citizenship, she will be successful.
