In light of the fact that the citizenship judge spoke of evidence that would “justify” him making such a recommendation, and that his notice to the Minister makes reference to the comments by the applicant’s doctor, I believe that the present case is more in line with Justice Gauthier’s analysis. Since the evidence before me is insufficient to overcome the presumption that the decision-maker considered all of the evidence submitted, I am left to consider whether the citizenship judge’s conclusion was patently unreasonable, in light of the evidence before him.
