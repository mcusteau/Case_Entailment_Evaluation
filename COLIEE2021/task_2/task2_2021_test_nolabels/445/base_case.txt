Pelletier, J.
: Mr. Luliang is an editor for a daily newspaper in the People's Republic of China. He wishes to immigrate to Canada. For purposes of the assessment grid set out in Schedule 1 in the
Regulations
pursuant to the
Immigration Act
, 1985 R.S.C. c. I-2, he wishes to be assessed on the basis of his employment as an editor. The visa officer in Hong Kong who assessed Mr. Luliang would not process his application on the basis of his occupation as editor because he did not believe that Mr. Luliang had the necessary training, namely a degree in English, French or journalism. He assessed Mr. Luliang on the basis of employment in Canada as an Editorial Assistant. When assessed on that basis, Mr. Luliang scored 57 units of assessment, well short of the 70 units required for issuance of a visa. Mr. Luliang asks that the visa officer's assessment be set aside and that he be reassessed by another officer on the basis of his employment in Canada as an editor.
[2]
Mr. Luliang was educated at the Tianjin Foreign Languages Institute in the People's Republic of China which granted him a Bachelor's of Arts Degree in 1984. The transcript of his academic records discloses that he completed the following classes in completing his degree:

[3]
Following graduation, Mr. Luliang worked at the Tianjin Tool Research Institute as a translator as well as editing the Tianjin Tolling Journal (sic). In June of 1987, he began editing, on a part time basis, the Guide to Popular Investing Magazine. He was required to do so on a part time basis because the Institute would not release him from his employment due to a shortage of English speaking personnel. In November 1993, he went to work for the North China Information newspaper where he worked in the editorial department. At his interview, he indicated to the visa officer that there were 16 employees in the editorial department, all of whom were editors and also reporters. Mr. Luliang wrote articles as assigned by the editor in chief as well as editing the Health and Hygiene page which appeared weekly. Mr. Luliang also performed other duties such as commissioning and accepting stories from health professionals, editing submissions, and doing page layout.
[4]
The visa officer was not satisfied that Mr. Luliang had the necessary qualifications to be assessed on the basis of employment as editor. In his notes of the interview, he recorded the following:
"- Began interview with review of studies. Certs and transcript seen. PI holds BA in English, but in English as a foreign language. Transcript indicates studies in basic eng, grammar, reading and writing, translation, some course in lit, journalistic Eng (not journalism), linguistics. PI informs no other training, in journalism or languages. Says he has read many books on journalism, self-studies.
. . . . .
"- After graduation, assigned to work at Tianjin tool Research Inst. As translator; also acted as editor for Tianjin Tolling Journal (sic). No samples of this work seen. 87-93 PI says he worked as editor for guide to popular investment. I asked why ref ltr referred to P/T employment. PI replied that his dossier remained at Tianjin Tool Research Inst. Still worked there: they wouldn't let him leave as few eng spkrs there. PI says main job was at magazine however, where he commissioned articles, assigned work to writers, edited submitted articles. No sample of this work seen.
. . . . .
"2. Training and Educ do not meet NOC reqts. PI has no training in journalism and modes exp as reporter: NOC specifies several yrs exp in journalism, writing, publishing usually required. No pproof of PI's exp prev to current or a related discipline is usually required. PI holds a degree in Eng, but as noted above, studied Eng as a foreign language. There is a significant difference in studying Eng or Fr as a native spkr, to become an expert in the usage of the language, and studying it as a foreign language: PI is not expert in the use of Eng or Fr, or of Chinese for that matter, not having tertiary study in that language. Qualifications in language are not those set by NOC."
[5]
The visa officer formally advised Mr. Luliang of his decision by letter dated Nov. 13, 1998 which read as follows:
"File No.: B035193045(DAV)
November 13, 1998
Dear Fan Lu Liang,
This refers to your application for permanent residence in Canada, and your interview held on November 3, 1998. I have now completed my assessment of your application and regret to inform you that I have determined that you do not meet the requirements for immigration to Canada in the Independent category.
Pursuant to ss. 8(1) and 9(1) of the
Immigration Regulations, 1978
as amended, immigrants in the Independent category shall be assessed on the basis of each of the factors listed in column 1 of Schedule 1 of the Regulations. These factors are: education, education/training factor, experience, occupational demand, arranged employment or designated occupation, demographic factor, age, knowledge of English and French languages and, on the basis of an interview, personal suitability.
I have assessed you in the occupation Editorial Assistant, NOC 1452.3, for which you earned the following units of assessment:
Age	10
Occupational Demand	03
Education/Training Factor	05
Experience	04
Arranged Employment	00
Demographic Factor	08
Education	15
English	07
French	00
Personal Suitability	05
Total	57
You have failed to earn the minimum required units of assessment required to pass in the Independent category (70). I consider the units of assessment which you have been awarded are an accurate reflection of your ability to successfully establish in Canada.
I have also considered your application in the occupation of Editors NOC 5122 & Journalists NOC 5123, but I am not satisfied that you meet the entry requirements of these occupations as defined in the National Occupational Classification.
There is no other occupations apparent on your application in which you or your spouse are qualified and experienced, and under which application would be successful.
Because you cannot meet the selection criteria established for Independents, you are a member of the class of persons who are inadmissible to Canada described in paragraph 19(2)(d) of the
Immigration Act
and I have refused your application. I have attached copies of the legislation referred to in this letter for your reference.
Since your application has been refused, you are entitled to a refund to the Right of Landing Fee that you paid when you submitted your application. Please be informed that we are currently processing a refund which should be received within 3-4 months.
I realize that this decision may be a disappointment to you and regret that it could not be favourable.
Yours truly,
'Daniel A. Vaughan'
Vice-Consul"
[6]
Mr. Luliang applies for judicial review of the visa officer's decision on the basis that the visa officer has added occupational qualifications which are not required by the National Occupational Classification (NOC) or has misconstrued the requirements of the NOC.

Immigration Act
and
Immigration Regulations, 1978

"
Critères de sélection
"8(1) Sous réserve de l'article 11.1, afin de déterminer si un immigrant et les personnes à sa charge, à l'exception d'un parent, d'un réfugié au sens de la Convention cherchant à se réinstaller et d'un immigrant qui entend résider au Québec, pourront réussir leur installation au Canada, l'agent des visas apprécie l'immigrant ou, au choix de ce dernier, son conjoint:
a) dans le cas d'un immigrant qui n'est pas visé aux alinéas b) ou c), suivant chacun des facteur énumérés à la colonne I de l'annexe I;
b) dans le cas d'un immigrant qui compte devenir un travailleur autonome au Canada, suivant chacun des facteurs énumérés dans la colonne I de l'annexe I, autre que le facteur visé à l'article 5 de cette annexe;
c) dans le cas d'un entrepreneur ou d'un investisseur, suivant chacun des facteurs énumérés dans la colonne I de l'annexe I, sauf ceux visés aux articles 4 et 5 de cette annexe.

. . . . .
"9(1) Sous réserve du paragraphe (1.01) et de l'article 11, lorsqu'un immigrant, autre qu'une personne appartenant à la catégorie de la famille, qu'un parent aidé ou qu'un réfugié au sens de la Convention cherchant à se réétablir, présente une demande de visa d'immigrant, l'agent des visas peut lui en délivrer un ainsi qu'à toute personne à charge qui l'accompagne si:
a) l'immigrant et les personnes à sa charge, qu'elles l'accompagnent ou non, ne font pas partie d'une catégorie de personnes et satisfont aux exigences de la Loi et du présent règlement; et
b) lorsqu'ils entendent résider au Canada ailleurs qu'au Québec, suivant son appréciation de l'immigrant ou du conjoint de celui-ci selon l'article 8;
(i) dans le cas d'un immigrant, autre qu'un entrepreneur, un investisseur, ou un candidat d'une province, il obtient au moints 70 points d'appréciation,"
[8]
Schedule 1 is attached to these reasons for ease of reference [omitted]. The portion of particular relevance is the section dealing with Education and Training:
"2. Education and Training
(1) To be measured by the amount of formal education and professional, vocational, apprenticeship, in-plant or on-the-job training specified in the National Occupational Classification as being necessary to acquire the information techniques and skills required for the occupation in which the applicant is assessed under Item 4 ...
4. Occupational Factor
(1) Units of assessment shall be awarded on the basis of employment opportunities in Canada in the occupation
(a) for which the applicant meets the employment requirements for Canada as set out in the National Occupational Classification;
(b) in which the applicant has performed a substantial number of the main duties as set out in the National Occupational Classification, including the essential ones; and
(c) that the applicant is prepared to follow in Canada"
[9]
The entry in the NOC upon which Mr. Luliang relies reads as follows:
"Editor
Employment requirements:
A bachelor's degree in journalism, English, French or a related discipline is usually required.
Several years of experience in journalism, writing, publishing, or a related field are usually required."
[10]
The crux of this case is the visa officer's refusal to treat Mr. Luliang's Bachelor of Arts from the Tiajin Foreign Languages Institute as satisfying the education requirement specified by the NOC for the position of editor. Mr. Luliang says that by insisting that the English degree should provide one with a measure of expertise in the English language, the visa officer is adding requirements which do not appear in the NOC. Mr. Luliang relies upon
Haughton v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1996), 111 F.T.R. 226; 34 Imm. L.R.(2d) 284 (T.D.) for the proposition that a visa officer is not free to add to the requirements of the NOC. In that case, the candidate wished to be assessed on the basis of employment as an executive secretary. The candidate met the requirements set out in the C.C.D.O (Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations), the predecessor to the NOC. However, the visa officer felt that the candidate was not qualified for the position because she had no training or experience in the use of personal computers and associated office software. Rothstein, J. (as he then was), held that the C.C.D.C. was a binding system of classification and assessment and that the visa officer was not free to add to it, based upon his view of employment requirements:
"The wording of the visa officer's decision indicates that the criteria outside of the CCDO which were considered were dominant in his decision. The skills he considered were not unreasonable in that they probably are skills required in the contemporary Canadian office environment. However, the visa officer is bound by the CCDO definitions. While it may be that there is a problem wiht the outdated definitions provided in the CCDO, a visa officer is nonetheless not permitted to substitute his/her own criteria for a given occupation. Under the terms of the
Immigration Act
and
Regulations
, that is for Parliament or the Governor General-in-Council to address."
On that basis, Mr. Luliang says that it is not for the visa officer to impose an additional requirement of expertise which is not found in the NOC.
[11]
The Minister responds by distinguishing the present case from
Haughton
on the basis that in
Haughton
requirements were added, whereas all that has happened here is that the visa officer has interpreted the requirements of the NOC so "degree in English" means a degree in the study of English such as one would undertake in a liberal arts program of studies as opposed to a course of studies in English as a second language. This is not adding requirements; it is simply interpreting the requirements which NOC has already stipulated.
[12]
In
Prajapati v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1463; 103 F.T.R. 37 (T.D.), Gibson held that a visa officer must interpret the CCDO correctly and if he misinterprets it, his decision is liable to be set aside. FRAGMENT_SUPPRESSED
[13]
The substance of Mr. Luliang's argument is that he is entitled to the benefit of a literal reading of the NOC and, since he has a degree in English, he should be treated as meeting the requirements of the section. Mr. Luliang goes then points to the Handbook issued to departmental staff which instructs them in how to process applications and relies upon the following extract:
"
Assessment
a) ... There is no equivalency system. Programs of study are to be assessed on the basis of the standards which exist in the country of study."
[14]
The effect, says Mr. Luliang, is that not only does he satisfy the requirement which appears in the NOC, in that he has a degree in English, but the visa officer is, by the Department's own policy, precluded from making judgments about the equivalence of his degree with an English degree from a Canadian university. There is no room for interpretation. The difficulty with the argument is that it cannot be supported on the language of the NOC itself.
[15]
What does a degree in English mean? Presumably, it means a Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in English, as most Canadian readers of the NOC would understand it. Would it include a Bachelor of Education degree with a major of adult education, English as a second language? Would it extend to a Bachelor's degree in applied linguistics, or etymology. Clearly, there is room for interpretation in considering what is meant by "a degree in English".
[16]
Does the need to construe the NOC requirements somewhat mean that the visa officer is free to make judgments about the equivalence of various credentials, notwithstanding the departmental policy? The answer to this question depends upon the view which one takes of the role of the assessment function.
[17]
Section 3 of the
Immigration Act
, which sets out the objectives of Canada's immigration policy, does not set out the criteria by which potential immigrants will be screened except by implication. For example, subs. (j) which speaks of denying the use of Canadian territory "to persons who are likely to engage in criminal activity", can be seen as validating a policy of refusing admission to criminals or those whose association with criminals makes them likely "to engage in criminal activity". There is no particular objective of Canadian immigration policy which speaks directly to the question of employability of new Canadians except perhaps for subs. (a) which refers to the demographic goals of the Canadian government:
"
Part I - Canadian Immigration Policy
"Partie I - Politique Canadienne d'Immigration
"
Objectives
3. Immigration Objectives -
. . . . .
(a) to support the attainment of such demographic goals as may be established by the Government of Canada in respect of the size, rate of growth, structure and geographic distribution of the Canadian population;"
"
Objectifs
3. Objectifs en matière d'immigration -
. . . . .
a) de concourir à la réalisation des objectifs démographiques établis par le gouvernement du Canada en ce qui concerne le chiffre, le taux de croissance, la structure et la répartition géographique de la population canadienne;"
[18]
On the other hand, when one examines the criteria by which candidates are assessed, as set out in Schedule 1 to the
Immigration Regulations 1978
, one notes that the criteria and the maximum points allowed for each are as follows:
Education	16
Education and Training	18
Experience	8
Occupational Factor	10
Arranged Employment	10
Demographic Factor	10
Age	10
Knowledge of English or French	15
Personal suitability
10
Total	107
[19]
To qualify for the issuance of a visa, a candidate must score at least 70 points. Of the criteria, education and training (18 points), experience (8 points), occupational factor (10 points), arranged employment or designated occupation (10 points) refer exclusively to employment and total 46 points. A person who had no score or a very low score on those items has no chance of being admitted to Canada. In addition, demographic factor (10 points) refers to labour market considerations and personal suitability (10 points) refers to the likelihood of becoming successfully established in Canada, a component of which is the likelihood of securing employment. Clearly, the ability of a potential immigrant to be gainfully employed is a very significant factor in the assessment of candidates.
[20]
If the function of the visa officer is to implement the policy imbedded in Schedule 1, then screening should be done with a view to accurately reflecting the employment potential of candidates. In particular this suggests that the assessment of qualifications should reflect the expectations of a Canadian employer, acting reasonably and in good faith. In this case, a Canadian publisher seeking to hire an editor would require a person whose command of English made him/her capable of maintaining high standards of English usage.
To the extent that the employer relied upon academic credentials
, those credentials should reflect a study of English at a level which offers some reason to believe that a significant proficiency in the language has been achieved. Such an employer, acting reasonably and in good faith, would not accept Mr. Luliang's degree as the equivalent of a liberal arts degree in English, for the reason set out by the visa officer, that is, Mr. Luliang's degree in English is a degree in English as a second language.
[21]
This is not to deny that someone in the position of Mr. Luliang could have a superior command of English, notwithstanding the curriculum of studies at the Tianjin Foreign Languages Institute. The only point being made about Mr. Luliang's qualifications is that his degree does not, in and of itself, connote, in the eyes of a reasonable Canadian employer acting in good faith, the same competence in English as would a liberal arts degree in English.
[22]
There are obviously limits to a visa officer's ability to make judgments of this nature. The more specialized and technical an individual's qualifications, the more difficult it would be for a visa officer to make a reasoned assessment with assistance from competent authorities. But this does not mean that where, as here, a reasonable judgment can be made by the visas officer, it should not be made. For that reason, I find no fault with the visa officer`s determination and I am not prepared to disturb it. The application for judicial review is dismissed.
Application dismissed.
