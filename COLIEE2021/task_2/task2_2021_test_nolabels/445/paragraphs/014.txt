[14]
Counsel for the applicant did not recommend certification of a question in this matter. Counsel for the respondent recommended that I consider certification of a question in the following terms:
"Can an application for judicial review proceed in the absence of evidence in the affidavit filed in support of the originating motion that the impugned decision was based on an incorrect finding of fact, contained an error at law or otherwise discloses no ground for judicial review?"
I am not satisfied that the affidavit filed in support of this application for judicial review, with paragraph 6 of that affidavit and the related exhibit E to the affidavit struck out, discloses a complete absence of evidence that the impugned decision was based on an incorrect finding of fact, contained an error of law or otherwise discloses a ground for judicial review. In the circumstances, taking into account the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
Liyanagamage v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1994), 176 N.R. 4 (F.C.A.), the question proposed could not properly be certified. In the result, no question will be certified.
Application allowed.
