The affidavits of the Applicant and his Wife in this proceeding indicate that, on a salary of $2,500 per month, the Applicant has paid the rent and 70% of the household expenses while his Wife has been on maternity benefits. However, there is no evidence about her former salary as a secretary and no explanation for her lack of a job and job prospects after a long career. There is also no evidence to support her claim that she is not eligible for welfare and no evidence about whether the Applicant's two brothers, who live in the Vancouver area and who supported the H & C Application, are able to help the Wife. Finally, there is no evidence about the Applicant's ability to contribute to the support of his family while he is in the Dominican Republic.
