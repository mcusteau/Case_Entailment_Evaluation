There is no doubt in my mind that the Applicant's two Canadian born children will suffer irreparable harm if she is removed from Canada and they are left behind. The evidence clearly shows that the situation of these children would be at best precarious, since neither their father nor the Applicant's current partner seem prepared to nurture them on a long term basis, let alone provide them with a loving and stable environment. Such a clear infringement of the best interests of a child and of its most basic human rights must necessarily constitute an irreparable harm.
