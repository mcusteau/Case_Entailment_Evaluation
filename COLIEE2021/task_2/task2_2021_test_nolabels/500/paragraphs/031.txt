The case law of this Court is divided as to whether a removals officer is under an obligation to consider the best interests of a child when assessing if it is reasonably practicable for a removal order to be executed. In some cases, such an obligation has been flatly rejected (see, for example,
John et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 583; 231 F.T.R. 248 (T.D.);
Mensah v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2004] F.T.R. Uned. 47; 2004 FC 78), while in other cases, the absence of clear evidence as to the impact of the removal on the child was also relied on as a justification not to disturb the decision of the officer to proceed with the removal (see, for example,
Buchting v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 538; [2003] F.C.J. No. 1216 (F.C.);
Parsons v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.T.R. Uned. 501; 2003 FC 913).
