Furthermore, it must be stressed that the
Convention on the Rights of the Child
does not rule out entirely the possibility of a child being separated from his or her parents. As noted by Justice Nadon in
Simoes
, after referring to the Federal Court of Appeal decision in
Langner v. Ministre de l'Emploi et de l'Immigration et al.
(1995), 184 N.R. 230 (F.C.A.):
"... this confirms that the best interests of the child are an important consideration, but not one which, in and of itself, can preclude the enforcement of the law - for instance, in the form of a removal order. This is reflected in the
Convention on the Rights of the Child
, Can. T.S. 1992 No. 3 which not only addresses the best interests of children at article 3(1), but also envisions the possibility of separation of children from their parents in the context of detention, deportation, imprisonment, or death. As Article 9(4) of the
Convention
stipulates:
'Where such separation [of children from their parents] results from any action initiated by a State Party, such as the detention, imprisonment, exile, deportation or death (including death arising from any cause while the person is in the custody of the State) of one or both parents or of the child, that State Party shall, upon request, provide the parents, the child or, if appropriate, another member of the family with the essential information concerning the whereabouts of the absent member(s) of the family unless the provision of the information would be detrimental to the well-being of the child. State Parties shall further ensure that the submission of such a request shall of itself entail no adverse consequences for the person(s) concerned.'"
