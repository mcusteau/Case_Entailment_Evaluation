Section 48(2) of
IRPA
states that "if a removal order is enforceable, the foreign national against whom it was made must leave Canada immediately and it must be enforced as soon as is reasonably practicable". There is general agreement that this leaves the removals officer with very little discretion. As Justice Nadon said in
Simoes et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2000] F.C.J. No. 936; 187 F.T.R. 219 (T.D.), at para. 12:
"In my opinion, the discretion that a removal officer may exercise is very limited, and in any case, is restricted to when a removal order will be executed. In deciding when it is 'reasonably practicable' for a removal order to be executed, a removal officer may consider various factors such as illness, other impediments to traveling, and pending H & C applications that were brought on a timely basis but have yet to be resolved due to backlogs in the system."
