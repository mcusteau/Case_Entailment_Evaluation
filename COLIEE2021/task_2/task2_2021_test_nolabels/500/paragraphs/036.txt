For all these reasons, I am of the view that the filing of an H & C application cannot automatically bar the execution of a removal order, even if it results in the separation of a child from his or her parent(s). Similarly, removals officers cannot be required to undertake a full substantive review of the humanitarian circumstances that are to be considered as part of an H & C assessment. Not only would that result in a "pre H & C" application", to use the words of Justice Nadon in
Simoes
, but it would also duplicate to some extent the real H & C assessment. More importantly, removals officers have no jurisdiction or delegated authority to determine applications for permanent residence submitted under s. 25 of the
IRPA
. They are employed by the Canadian Border Services Agency, an agency under the auspices of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness, and not by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration. They are not trained to perform an H & C assessment.
