I also dealt with a similar problem when considering the effect of non-compliance of the provisions of a statute in the case of Apsassin v. Canada, [1988] 3 F.C. 20 (F.C.T.D.). The following statement can be found at page 71:
"Examination of the object of the statute reveals that a decision which would render the surrender null and void solely because of noncompliance with the formalities of s. 51(3) would certainly not promote the main object of the legislation where all substantial requirements have been fulfilled; it might well cause serious inconvenience or injustice to persons having no control over those entrusted with the duty of furnishing evidence of compliance in proper form. In the subsection, unlike subs. (1), where it is provided that unless it is complied with no surrender shall be valid or binding, there is no provision for any consequences of nonobservance. I therefore conclude that the provisions of subs. 51(3) are merely directory and not mandatory."
