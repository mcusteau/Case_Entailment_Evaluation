In deciding whether the word "shall" in s. 16(2) of the Regulations is directory or imperative one must, therefore, consider whether there are provisions somewhere in the statute which might clearly indicate that it was the legislator's intention to make the provision mandatory. If so, then obviously the court must give effect to the intention of the legislature. Also in the present case there are no consequences of any kind indicated in the Act or the Regulations which would flow from nonconformance with the provision regarding a hearing to be held at least thirteen weeks before the projected date of release nor is there anything to indicate that the stipulation would be mandatory. As there is no such indication, then one must consider the general object of the legislation. As to the general object of the Parole Act, it seems to be clear that the Act itself and, more particularly, the amendments introduced in 1986, which substituted a presumptive release date for mandatory release, was enacted not only for the purpose of benefitting the prisoners but also, and mainly for the protection of the public against the possible consequences of a release from parole, since the absolute right of the inmate for release on parole when a certain portion of the sentence served has been removed and release becomes subject to control by the Parole Board.
