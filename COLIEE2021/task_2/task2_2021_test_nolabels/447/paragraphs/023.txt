[23]
Subsection 244(a) is relevant to the present matter since the Applicant is basing his case upon the alleged unlikeliness that the Respondent will appear for an admissibility hearing. The Applicant submitted before the Board that the Respondent is likely to be found inadmissible. On that basis, he argued that the Respondent has an interest in not attending an admissibility hearing. The Applicant also argued to the Board that the Respondent is unlikely to present himself for removal, once ordered to do so.
