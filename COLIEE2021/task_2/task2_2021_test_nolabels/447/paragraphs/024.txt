[24]
Section 245 of the
Regulations
is a list of factors that relate specifically to the issue of flight risk, pursuant to subsection 244(a), quoted above. As noted earlier, the only two provisions of section 245 that are relevant in the within matter are subsections (f) and (g). Since flight risk is the consideration, the Board must ask whether involvement in a people smuggling or trafficking operation would lead a person in the circumstances of the Respondent to not appear. As well, subsection (g) requires the Board to consider the existence of strong community ties in Canada as a factor in assessing the existence of a flight risk.
