The Minister bears the burden of showing that the Respondent is a flight risk. The Federal Court of Appeal held, in
Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham
, [2004] 3 F.C.R. 572; 315 N.R. 91; 2004 FCA 4 at para. 24, as follows:
"The reasons of Gauthier, J., are logical and clear. I am fully satisfied that she correctly applied the proper standards of review to Mr. Iozzo's findings and that she correctly interpreted the relevant law. I would dismiss the appeal. I would answer the certified question as follows:
'At each detention review made pursuant to sections 57 and 58 of the
Immigration Refugee Protection Act
, S.C. 2001, c. 27, the Immigration Division must come to a fresh conclusion whether the detained person should continue to be detained. Although an evidentiary burden might shift to the detainee once the Minister has established a prima facie case, the Minister always bears the ultimate burden of establishing that the detained person is a danger to the Canadian public or is a flight risk at such reviews. However, previous decisions to detain the individual must be considered at subsequent reviews and the Immigration Division must give clear and compelling reasons for departing from previous decisions.'"
