The Respondent argues that the Applicant bears the burden, on the balance of probabilities, of showing that it was unlikely that he would appear for an admissibility hearing. The Respondent submits that the Applicant was required to establish a link between the debt owed to the smugglers and his lack of family connection in Canada to the likelihood that he would not appear for an admissibility hearing. The Respondent submits that the Applicant has failed to submit this evidence.
