A negative credibility finding under s. 96 may be determinative of a s. 97 claim. In
Rahaman v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),
2002 FCA 89, the Federal Court of Appeal stated at para. 29:
However, as MacGuigan J.A. acknowledged in Sheikh, supra, in fact the claimant's oral testimony will often be the only evidence linking the claimant to the alleged persecution and, in such cases, if the claimant is not to be found credible, there will be no credible or trustworthy evidence to support the claim. Because they are not claimant-specific, country reports alone are normally not a sufficient basis on which the Board can uphold a claim.
