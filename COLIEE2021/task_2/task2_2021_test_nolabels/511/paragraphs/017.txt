The RPD reviewed country documentation that indicated attitudes in St. Lucia against homosexuals go beyond social discrimination and included acts of violence against homosexuals. The 2008 U.S. Department of State reports that there are few openly gay people in the country and at least two cases of violence against homosexuals including one homosexual who was killed after being hung from a tree because he was openly gay. The RPD noted the police were investigating the crime but also observed that police do not always investigate complaints of homophobic violence.
