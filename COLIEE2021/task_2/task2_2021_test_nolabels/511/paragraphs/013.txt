The RPD gave little weight to the affidavit of the sister who declared that the assailant also attacked her and that the police refused to investigate. She had stated: "I tried to report the matter to the police but they said they were not interested in protecting gays." The RPD stated:
There is evidence such as affidavits from ... the claimant's sister and mother that supports the claimant's allegation that Seika continues today to make threats. ... His sister states that she was physically attacked by Seika and that the police refused to help gays. Once against, the claimant's sister is not gay and this statement lacks a ring of truth. I assigned little probative weight to this affidavit.
