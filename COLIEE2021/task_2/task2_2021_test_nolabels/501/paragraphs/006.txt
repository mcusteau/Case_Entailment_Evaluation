Section 9 of the
Regulations
, under which the visa officer assessed the application for permanent residence, is subject to the provisions of s. 11. As a result, in circumstances where an applicant fails to meet the requirements outlined in s. 9, s. 11(3) permits a visa officer to determine whether a visa should nevertheless issue "... if, in his opinion, there are good reasons why the number of units of assessment awarded do not reflect the chances of the particular immigrant and his dependants of becoming successfully established in Canada ...".
