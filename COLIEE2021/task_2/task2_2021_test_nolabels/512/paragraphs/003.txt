During the four years preceding his application, the respondent frequently travelled outside Canada. Despite the fact that the respondent was physically present in Canada for only 406 days in the four years preceding the date of his application for citizenship, the Citizenship Judge found that the respondent's life was centralized in Canada; he therefore approved the respondent's application. This decision gave rise to the present appeal by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (the "applicant").
