, ibid. Reed, J., articulated six factors which can help in determining if an applicant has a centralized mode of existence in Canada at paragraph 10:
"(1) was the individual physically present in Canada for a long period prior to recent absences which occurred immediately before the application for citizenship?
"(2) where are the applicant's immediate family and dependents (and extended family) resident?
"(3) does the pattern of physical presence in Canada indicate a returning home or merely visiting the country?
"(4) what is the extent of the physical absences - if an applicant is only a few days short of the 1,095-day total it is easier to find deemed residence that if those absences are extensive?
"(5) is the physical absence caused by a clearly temporary situation such as employment as a missionary abroad, following a course of study abroad as a student, accepting temporary employment abroad, accompanying a spouse who has accepted employment abroad?
"(6) what is the quality of the connection with Canada: is it more substantial than that which exists with any other country?"
