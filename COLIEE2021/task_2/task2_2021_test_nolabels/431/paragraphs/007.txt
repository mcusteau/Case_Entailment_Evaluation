Third, is the Immigration Officer's expressed concerns about the applicant's illegal entry to the United Kingdom, his illegal employment in the United Kingdom and his failure to pay taxes in that county. I cannot read the sentence in which she states those concerns as being anything but an expression of concern for the applicant's moral character. I understand that the Immigration Officer, in her affidavit, has attempted to cast a different light on the concerns which she expressed in her letter but, in my view, it is not open to her to change the grounds upon which an application has been refused. That is what has been attempted here. I would only add that I do not deny that the applicant's failure to pay taxes in the United Kingdom might conceivably become relevant under the heading of "Personal Suitability" if it were expressed and considered only from the point of view that he was unable to support himself except by failing to pay taxes. That, however, is not the way it is expressed in the letter and I am quite satisfied that was not the sentiment that was in the Immigration Officer's mind when the letter was written.
