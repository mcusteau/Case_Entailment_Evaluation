It follows from what I have said that the decision cannot stand. However, in the paragraph which I read at the beginning of these reasons in which the Immigration Officer explains her decision there are a number of other considerations which were properly taken into account. It is, of course, quite impossible for me to know what weight the Immigration Officer gave to each of those factors and indeed what weight was attached to the factors which were improperly considered. It may be, given the rather fluid nature of the assessment of personal suitability, that even if the improperly considered factors had been excluded the ultimate score would not have been very different. Since it is impossible to tell, the only solution is to send the matter back for reassessment and I think such reassessment should be of the entire application not merely of the item "Personal Suitability". I propose to enter an order to that effect after hearing if counsel have any submissions to make on whether there is a question of general importance raised in this case.
Application allowed.
