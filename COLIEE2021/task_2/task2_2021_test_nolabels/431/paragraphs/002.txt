In her letter to the applicant, the Visa Officer explained her award of points under this Factor in the following terms:
"In awarding you a score of four for personal suitability, I took into account the lack of any firsthand experience of Canada. I believe that your expectations of Canada are unrealistic. You have never been to Canada, have no relatives or close friends established there to assist you, nor have you demonstrated that you would be able to obtain employment in your field in Canada. In the United Kingdom, you have been been (sic) residing illegally for a number of years, you have been employed illegally and have not been paying taxes, thereby showing disrespect for UK immigration, employment and tax law. You have not demonstrated initiative in researching the job market in Canada to locate potential employers but instead have relied soley (sic) on contacts supplied by your consultant. For all of these reasons, you have shown a lack of motivation, adaptability and resourcefulness."
