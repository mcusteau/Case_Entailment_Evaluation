Those words are almost identical to the quoted words used by the Visa Officer in assessing personal suitability. It is well settled that one cannot double count. It is, of course, permissible to take into account factors which may have been taken into account for other reasons in other parts of the schedule but I am quite unable to distinguish what the Visa Officer says in her letter in the quoted portion from what she was required to assess under Factor 4. Furthermore, a failure to demonstrate an ability to obtain employment in Canada is also not a personal "quality" similar to those listed in Factor 9.
