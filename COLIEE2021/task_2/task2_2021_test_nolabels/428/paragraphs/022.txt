With these facts as background, the tribunal made the following findings:
"1. I find that the appellant
was reluctant to acknowledge his financial obligations to Canadian
and Provincial government [sic] under this undertaking. I find the appellant is in default under this undertaking in the amount of $60,000.
"2. The appellant
made no effort to reimburse the province of Ontario for the social assistance payments
received by his parents during the term of his undertaking
until after his application to sponsor his wife was refused on December 28, 2001.
The appellant indicated that he made an inquiry as to the amount owing and was told that the province of Ontario required payment in full.
The appellant testified that he did not discuss a monthly payment schedule.
