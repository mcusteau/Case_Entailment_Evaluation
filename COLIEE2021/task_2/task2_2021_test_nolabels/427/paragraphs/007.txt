The Board made four key credibility findings:
1. The applicant had no knowledge about the basic information relating to the demonstration in which his brother-in-law allegedly participated, e.g., when it took place. The Board found it not credible that the applicant made no efforts to get specific details of the incident that led him to flee his country of nationality;
2. There was no credible or trustworthy evidence to show the applicant truly had a brother-in-law named Onefe. The Board determined the applicant could have reasonably obtained a sworn declaration from his common law spouse or another relative to this effect;
3. There was no credible or trustworthy evidence to establish the applicant's marital status or the existence of his common law spouse. The Board noted that this relationship was central to the claim as all of his alleged problems stem from the relationship; and
4. There were contradictions in the medical evidence presented by the applicant, explanations which the Board found were excuses to fabricate his claim.
