In support of the contention that s. 18 applies to an adjudicator, counsel for the applicant relied on the decision of Rouleau, J., in
Penelakut Indian Band v. Charlie et al.
(1994), 73 F.T.R. 150 (T.D.), wherein he wrote at p. 155:
"The
Chandler
decision, supra, also appears to suggest flexibility. It should be remembered that the adjudicator is master of her own procedure and she should have re-opened the proceeding in order to fully assess the merits of the complaint. Section 18 of the
Code
provides that the Canada Labour Relations Board:
'may review, rescind, amend alter or vary any order or decision
. . . . .
and may rehear any application before making an order in respect of the application.'
"This is a clear indication that her decision should have been re-opened."
This decision, with great respect, appears to be wrong. With respect to that learned judge, I cannot accept that s. 18 applies to proceedings under Division XIV of the
Code
. Section 18 provides:
"18. The Board may review, rescind, amend, alter or vary any order or decision made by it, and may rehear any application before making an order in respect of the application."
Section 3(1) defines "Board" as:
"'Board' means the Canada Labour Relations Board continued by s. 9;"
