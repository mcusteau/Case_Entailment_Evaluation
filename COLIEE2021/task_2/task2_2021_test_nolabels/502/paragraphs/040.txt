With respect to the second paragraph, it reveals that the employer is not willing to compensate the complainant for professional fees disbursed. Although this statement was not strictly proper, it was a matter which was properly before the adjudicator during the second hearing. The employer had opportunity to address this issue and make its own representations on the point. In this regard I adopt the same position as that taken by the Federal Court of Appeal in
Banca
, supra. In
Banca
, counsel for one party put before the adjudicator a letter which revealed that an offer did not cover costs incurred by the complainant. Stone, J.A., for the court wrote at p. 69:
"While I do not regard the letters of July 21 [the letter discussed above] and 22 with the same degree of objection as I do the letter of October 6, they must yet be condemned as irregular in that they represented an attempt to place evidence before the adjudicator. This irregularity was alleviated to some extent because the applicant had an opportunity to state an objection and, if need be, meet the allegations at the hearing itself."
However, the court refused to state that the content of the letters of July 21 and 22 led to a reasonable apprehension of bias. They did however find, at p. 70, that the letter of October 6 created a reasonable apprehension of bias because:
"[i]t contained a serious assertion questioning the very truthfulness of the applicant's claim that the position formerly held by the respondent had been abolished. It also asserted facts that simply were not properly placed before the adjudicator, who had yet to decide whether to grant the requested remedy of reinstatement."
