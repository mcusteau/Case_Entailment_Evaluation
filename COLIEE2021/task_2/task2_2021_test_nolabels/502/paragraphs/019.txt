Failure to recognize a potential for a reasonable apprehension of bias will not leave a party without a remedy. If the failure to raise the issue results from no fault of the individual adversely affected, for example it is not a tactical manoeuvre, the issue may be raised on an appeal or, as in this case, on an application for judicial review. This case is not analogous to that facing Lord Goddard in
R. v. Nailsworth Licensing Justices, ex parte Bird
, [1953] 1 W.L.R. 1046 (D.C.), wherein he stated at p. 1048:
"The solicitor did not take his objection then and it seems clear that he decided to let the matter go on, taking the view that this was a heaven-sent opportunity of getting the order quashed if the committee found in favour of the application. That would be sufficient ground for refusing this application."
