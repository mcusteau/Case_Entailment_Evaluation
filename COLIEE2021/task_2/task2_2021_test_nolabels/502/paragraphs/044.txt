[44]
On the basis of the written submissions received by me from counsel for both parties and the oral submissions of counsel for the applicant, I indicated at the hearing that I did not believe that the award in this case could stand. However, I indicated that should my view of the matter change, I would give counsel for the applicant an opportunity to respond. In these circumstances, counsel for the applicant did not give full oral argument before me during the hearing.
