At the commencement of the hearing to fix the quantum, counsel for the applicant employer brought a motion for the adjudicator to disqualify himself on the basis of a reasonable apprehension of bias. The applicant argued that a letter, which was put into evidence by Chief St. Denis who was representing the Band at the hearing of the merits, was prejudicial to the employer's case in that it disclosed the position taken by Labour Canada with respect to the merits of Ms. Young's case. The applicant states that Labour Canada is the adjudicator's employer. Therefore, its opinion should not have been admitted into evidence as it makes it appear that the adjudicator's decision was not his own but was influenced by the opinion in the letter. Not only was the adjudicator correct in refusing to decide this issue because he was clearly "functus", the admission of the letter did not lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias.
