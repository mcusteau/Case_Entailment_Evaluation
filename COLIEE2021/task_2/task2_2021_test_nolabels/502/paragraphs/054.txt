In his supplemental award the adjudicator canvassed six decisions in assessing the appropriate award. In
Hill v. Desolation Sound Tribal Council, et al.
(July 18, 1988) adjudicator Greyell awarded six months to a counsellor with nine years of service. [see footnote 3] Greyell did not refer to s. 242 in fixing the amount of remedy to be awarded to Mrs. Hill. He wrote at p. 23:
"I have considered the complainant's age, the circumstances and responsibilities of her employment, the tenure of employment and conclude that at common law, this employer would have been required to give Mrs. Hill six months notice of the termination of her employment."
