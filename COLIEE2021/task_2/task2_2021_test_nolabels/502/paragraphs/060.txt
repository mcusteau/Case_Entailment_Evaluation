Counsel for the applicant suggested that the adjudicator made a punitive award in this case which is clearly not allowed. In support of this contention counsel looks to the language of the adjudicator at p. 27 of the supplementary award:
"Ms. Young was dismissed at the very moment she would have returned to work following a maternity leave. She had formally received assurances that she would get her job back, and was never forewarned of her incoming dismissal. Moreover, the Band unsuccessfully tried to replace her under the guise of a newly-created position which they tried to fill with someone else."
I cannot agree with counsel's submission that, without more, this should be interpreted as meaning that the damage award was punitive in nature. Immediately preceding this passage, the adjudicator canvassed many other cases and recited the fact patterns for each case. In my view, this passage merely recaps the facts of this case. The award is not unreasonable and can be objectively justified. The adjudicator did not compensate Ms. Young for the entire period of unemployment between the date of her dismissal and the date of the award although the
Code
does allow for that. Thus, I cannot say that the quantum awarded was calculated based on punitive principles.
