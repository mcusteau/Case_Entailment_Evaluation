In
Potts v. Alexis Indian Band
(March 15, 1995) adjudicator Wakeling determined the award solely on the basis of ss. 230 and 235 despite having cited ver batim s. 242. At six he wrote:
"In
Knopp v. Westcan Bulk Transport Ltd.
, 13-14 (Feb. 22, 1994), I held that an employer unjustly dismissed an employee if it did not have just cause to dismiss the employee and did not provide the employee with the notice and compensation stipulated by ss. 230(1) and 235(1) of the
Canada Labour Code
, or the applicable common law, if the common law treated the employee more generously.
"The Alexis Indian Band did not allege that it had just cause to dismiss Ms. Potts. Nor did the band comply with ss. 230(1) and 235(1) of the
Canada Labour Code
and the common law.
. . . . .
"Section 230(1) requires the band to pay her two weeks wages at her regular rate of wages for her regular hours of work and s. 235(1) obliges the band to pay her five days wages at her regular rate of wages for her regular hours of work. This sum is $1,123.16 ..."
The first paragraph above reveals a clear error of law. Giving notice to an employee does not render just an otherwise unjust dismissal.
