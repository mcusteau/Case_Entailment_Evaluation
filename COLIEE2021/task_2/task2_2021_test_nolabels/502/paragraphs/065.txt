In awarding interest the adjudicator wrote at p. 29:
"The amounts owed for lost wages ($15,320) will bear interest as per the case law reviewed in
Cote v. Dicom Corporation
and
Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro of Canada Ltd. v. Lee-Shanok
. I set the rate at an annual rate of 3% which appears reasonable in the present circumstances, the current bank rate being set at around 4%. I further determine that the interests owed on this amount will run as of January 3, 1994, the date at which she would have returned to work.
"As for the other amounts owed ($2,733.64 + $485.84 = $3,217.48), they also will bear interest at the same annual rate of 3% but as of the date of our last hearing, i.e. June 14, 1995."
