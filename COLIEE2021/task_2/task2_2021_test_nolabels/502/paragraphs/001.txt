Nadon, J.
: The Wolf Lake Indian Band (the "applicant") is seeking an order quashing the decision of Serge Brault, an adjudicator appointed pursuant to Division XIV, Part III of the
Canada Labour Code
, R.S.C. 1985, c. L-1 (the "
Code
"). The applicant further seeks an order dismissing the complaint or setting aside the award. In his interim award, dated February 14, 1995, Mr. Brault found that Ms. Young (the "respondent") had been unjustly dismissed from her position as economic development and education officer. In a supplementary decision dated May 22, 1996, Mr. Brault ordered the applicant to pay to Ms. Young a lump sum of eight months' wages, plus personal expenses in the amount of $485.84 and compensation for legal costs and expenses in the amount of $2,733.64, all with interest.
