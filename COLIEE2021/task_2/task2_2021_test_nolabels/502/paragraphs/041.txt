The distinction I draw is that assertions contained in a letter put before the adjudicator, although inappropriate, do not necessarily lead to an apprehension of bias in these circumstances. The issues were properly before the adjudicator during the second hearing and all parties had the opportunity to address these issues and put evidence before the adjudicator. However, if evidence were put before the adjudicator after the hearing when all submissions were closed, as in the letter of October 6 referred to by Stone, J.A., above, this would be clearly inappropriate and might reasonably lead to an apprehension of bias as there would be no opportunity for the other side to respond. In addition, the very nature of the allegations in question in the October 6 letter questioned the honesty of the applicant in that proceeding as well as the integrity of its counsel.
