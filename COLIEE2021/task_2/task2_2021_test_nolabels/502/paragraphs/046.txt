The thrust of the comments which I received from counsel for the applicant, both written and orally, is found in paragraph 9 of their written submissions filed on April 8, 1997 as follows:
"The
Code
does allow that the award should be determined on the basis of the damages actually suffered by the complainant as a result of the dismissal, however, unless reinstatement of the position is awarded, the compensation will necessarily be less than all lost wages. The courts have previously found that compensation in unjust dismissal cases can be assessed as lost wages during a reasonable notice period. This has become an accepted practice which is responsive to the exact situation. For example, if the employee finds employment of greater value after a (sic) unjust dismissal, that employee should be compensated for the damages of the dismissal, however the
Act
is not intended to grant that employee a windfall profit."
With this general proposition I agree. The
Code
does not require that the adjudicator award a complainant her full salary as compensation. The complainant must mitigate her losses and the adjudicator must consider factors which might affect the appropriate quantum of the award. However, none of this precludes an award of full salary (minus deductions) from the date of the unjust dismissal to the date of the adjudicator's award if that is what is required to make the complainant whole.
