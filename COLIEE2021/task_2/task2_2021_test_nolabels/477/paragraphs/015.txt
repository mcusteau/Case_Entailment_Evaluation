The task of the Appeal Board when faced with a request for access to the scoring manual subject to an objection pursuant to s. 24(3) or (4) is to ask:
1) does the manual contain information which pertains to the appellant or the successful candidate? While it will do so in most cases, each case must be examined on its own facts.
2) if it does, is it relevant to the issues to be determined by the Appeal Board?
3) if the answer to both questions is yes, the Appeal Board may order access upon conditions which satisfy the requirements of s. 24(6). If for whatever reason, they cannot be satisfied, then access could be refused.
