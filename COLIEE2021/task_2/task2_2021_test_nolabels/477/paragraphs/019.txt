The Attorney General argues that since s. 24(5) only authorizes an application for access and ss. 24(6) only speaks of an order granting access, there is no jurisdiction for the Chairperson to order that copies be provided where the deputy head or the Com­mission invoke ss. 24(3) or (4) as the case may be. Kaczmar takes the position that as a matter of common sense, counsel cannot prepare adequately for examination and cross-examination of complex documents without having copies of those documents to work with. While not disputing the specific provisions relied upon by the Attorney Gen­eral, Kaczmar points to the definition of full disclosure found in s. 2 of the
Regulations
:
"'full disclosure' means access by the appellant to documents or information referred to in s. 24(1), the obtaining by the appellant of a copy of any document referred to in s. 24(2) and the submission of the allegations referred to in s. 25(1) by the appellant to the deputy head con­cerned"
"'divulgation complète' S'entend de l'accès par l'appelant à l'information ou aux docu­ments visés au paragraphe 24(1), de l'ob­tention d'une copie de tout document visé au paragraphe 24(2) et de la remise, par l'appelant à l'administrateur général en cause, des allégations visées au paragraphe 25(1)"
