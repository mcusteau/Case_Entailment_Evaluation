The Attorney General of Canada seeks judicial review of that part of the order allowing Kaczmar's representative to take notes and photocopies of the test material. Kaczmar brings his own application for judicial review of the decision to withhold production of the scoring manual to his representative and well as from the withhold­ing of the test results of individuals who have since accepted other positions. Both applications will be dealt with in these rea­sons.
