Kaczmar takes the position that since the Appeal Board has the authority pursuant to s. 25(6) to make an order imposing any measure it deems necessary to ensure full disclosure, and since the definition of full disclosure by implication refers to all rele­vant documents, the Appeal Board had jurisdiction to order copies of the testing materials. The implied reference to all rele­vant materials arises from the reference to s. 24(1) which uses the words "document that contains information ... that is liable to be disclosed before the appeal board."
