In
Barrak et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2008), 333 F.T.R. 109; 2008 FC 962, however, Mr. Justice de Montigny found at paragraph 32-34:
"
¶32
While the officer was entitled to rely on the same facts for the PRRA and the H&C assessments, she was required to apply the test of unusual and undeserved or disproportional hardship to those facts, a lower threshold than the test of risk to life or cruel and unusual punishment relevant to a PRRA decision ...
"
¶34
... The officer may well have dealt with the main applicant's fear of arrest, of torture, of being killed or beaten, or with the religious intolerance towards Christian Maronites. But she did not explain why these fears fall short of amounting to unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship, even if they do not rise to the threshold of personalized risk to the applicants. There being no certainty that the result of her analysis would have been the same had she applied her mind to the proper test, the file must be returned for a new determination."
