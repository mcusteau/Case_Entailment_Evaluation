In
Serda et al. v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 209; [2006] F.C.J. No. 425 (F.C.) Mr. Justice Yves de Montigny held at paragraph 31:
"Â¶ 31 Finally, the Applicants have argued that conditions in Argentina are dismal and not good for raising children. They cited statistics from the documentation, which were also considered by the H&C Officer, to show that Canada is a more desirable place to live in general. But the fact that Canada is a more desirable place to live is not determinative on an H&C application ... if it were otherwise, the huge majority of people living illegally in Canada would have to be granted permanent resident status for Humanitarian and Compassionate reasons. This is certainly not what Parliament intended in adopting section 25 of the
Immigration and Refugee Protection
Act
."
Accordingly, the fact that the applicants have better conditions in Canada then in Guyana does not constitute H&C hardship grounds when being asked to leave Canada.
