The PRRA officer stated (at p. 2b of the Application Record):
"The applicants state that they fear crime, violence and racial tension in Guyana. They fear to be targeted as returnees returning to Guyana. However, the applicants do not demonstrate how these incidents of crime and violence will personally affect them. A further assessment of current country conditions from impartial and well-known sources indicates that everyone in Guyana is subject to these risks and it is not specific to the applicants. The evidence does not establish that the applicants are personally at risk in Guyana. The evidence establishes that state protection is available for the applicants.
"The applicants submit that generalized risk may be sufficient to establish 'hardship', and therefore that a lack of evidence of personalized risk is not dispositive. They state that s. 25 of
IRPA
does not contain the same requirement of a personalized risk for 'hardship' that s. 113 requires for a PRRA application. They submit that the PRRA officer should have considered the general risk to them of exposure to violent crime if returned to Guyana. The jurisprudence is not clear on this proposition."
