The applicants rely on a number of cases to support their submission that an incorrect assumption that a claimant can return to return to Canada by way of another application is sufficient to set aside an H&C decision:
Arulraj v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2006] F.T.R. Uned. 313; 2006 FC 529;
Malekzai v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2004), 256 F.T.R. 199; 2004 FC 1099;
Shchegolevich v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2008] F.T.R. Uned. 400; 2008 FC 527;
Raposo v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(2005), 268 F.T.R. 179; 2005 FC 118. In the first three of these cases, the relevant issue was the best interests of the children and the hardship caused by the separation of a child from a parent who was being removed from Canada. In these cases, the H&C officers found that the hardship to the claimants was limited because the separation from the parent was only temporary. The facts in
Raposo
were similar, except that the case involved the separation of children from their grandparents. Had there been a chance that the separation from the parent would be lengthy or permanent, it was clear that the H&C officers would have found the separation adversely affected the best interests of the child.
