The applicants submit that the PRRA officer erred by applying the wrong test in assessing the applicant's risk and "hardship". Specifically, the applicants submit that the PRRA officer's finding that the applicants had not established a personalized risk and "hardship" demonstrates that the officer assessed the risk on a PRRA standard, rather than an H&C standard.
