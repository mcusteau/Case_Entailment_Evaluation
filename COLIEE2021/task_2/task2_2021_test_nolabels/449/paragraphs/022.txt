Here, the PRRA officer found, in considering the applicants' family ties, that the hardship of separation from their extended family in Canada would not amount to unusual, undeserved or disproportionate hardship and that the applicants' also had extended family in Guyana to help and support them. Moreover, while considering the best interest of the child, the PRRA officer found that the minor applicant would be able to readjust to life in Guyana because his parents would be with him to offer love and support. Thus, unlike in the cases cited by the applicant, the PRRA officer's finding did not hinge in this case on an assumption that the applicants would certainly be able to return as members of the family class. There is no indication that, if the PRRA officer thought the applicants may not be able to return, he would find the requisite hardship had been established. In fact, the decision quite clearly states that the hardships that would be faced by the applicants upon removal are not at the level that warrants an H&C exemption. For this reason, the PRRA officer's statement that the applicants could apply from overseas for family class status without any "apparent obstacles" is not an error that warrants setting aside the decision.
