Accordingly, the likelihood of being a victim of crime in Guyana by itself, is not a "hardship" for the purpose of an H&C application unless it is combined, as it is in the case of the applicants, with a timely sponsorship by the daughter, which, on a quick "paper screen", the respondent could determine whether the applicants will probably be legally entitled to permanent residence status in Canada. In such a case, it may be "unusual and undeserved or disproportionate hardship" for the applicants to be returned to Guyana, required to resettle in Guyana with the real possibility of being victimized by criminals, only then to be told after one or two more years that they can return to Canada as permanent residents. That disruption, caused by understandable bureaucratic delays in the processing of the sponsorship application, could be found by the immigration officer to constitute "unusual, underserved or disproportionate hardship" for the purpose of their H&C application. The overlay of the sponsorship application, with a paper screen analysis by the respondent as to its likelihood of success, is what separates the applicants' situation from other Indo-Guyenese with an H&C application who have to return to Guyana after losing their refugee claim and PRRA.
