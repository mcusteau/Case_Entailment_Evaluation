Following a hearing on September 8, 1999, the Board decided to reject Mr. Wood's appeal stating, in part (at page 3 of the decision):
"The Board has reviewed the Appellant's file and has noted that the service medical records failed to reveal any service related back injury. Low back pain is recorded in August 1996 with a seven to eight month history. The Appellant had physiotherapy treatments for his back and the last record, which is dated 12 November 1996, discloses back improvement. There is no medical record available since November 1996. The Medical Examiner at the time of the Medical Examination for Release dated 10 February 1998 simply indicated that the 'Appellant has had low back pain'.
"The Board is aware that mechanical back pain refers to muscular skeletal pain which arises from soft tissues in the lumbarsacral area. As there is insufficient evidence of any permanent worsening of claimed condition, and there is no documentation to support a service-related injury, the Board confirms the Entitlement review decision dated 6 April 1999."
The Board's decision was communicated to the Applicant by letter dated October 14, 1999. The Board's ruling was that his claim in regard to "Mechanical low back pain did not arise out of nor was it directly connected with service in peacetime Subsection 21(2),
Pension Act
". It is this decision that the applicant here seeks to have reviewed.
