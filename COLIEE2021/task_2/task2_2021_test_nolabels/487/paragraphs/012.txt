By letter dated December 17, 1987, the applicant was informed that his application for permanent residence in Canada was refused:
"After a careful and thorough review of your application, I regret to inform you that your request for entry as an immigrant to Canada has been refused since you have not been awarded any units of assessment for experience in the occupation you intend to follow in Canada.
"According to your application for permanent residence in Canada, your employment experience has been as 'Manager/Owner of a Garment Manufacturing & Sales Company'. During your interview on 16 December 1987, you stated that your responsibilities are: (1) purchasing materials, (2) taking orders from clients, (3) selling your goods, (4) supervising your employees and (5) keeping the accounts. In my view your experience corresponds to the definition (see attached) in the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (C.C.D.O.) for a supervisor, Wholesale Establishment, C.C.D.O. 5130-122. I do not believe that your various responsibilities can be broken down into separate components for the purposes of awarding you units of assessment for experience in your alternative intended occupations, i.e. either Material Purchasing Officer or Garments Sales Representative. I am, therefore, unable to issue an immigrant visa to you pursuant to the previously mentioned subs. 11(1) of the Regulations."
