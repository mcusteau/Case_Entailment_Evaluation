Each applicant has applied for permanent residence in Canada as an independent candidate pursuant to s. 6(1) of the Immigration Act. Such applications involve a two-stage assessment process during which it is the visa officer's duty to apply criteria set forth in the legislation and award points based on the ability of the applicant to become successfully established in Canada. The criteria for successful establishment include age, education, occupational demand and experience, language and personal suitability. The first phase of the assessment is a paper screening process in which immigration officials evaluate documents submitted by applicants and decide if the application process should be continued. If the applicant passes this phase, he is invited to an interview with a visa officer. Obviously, one of the most significant factors in any assessment is the applicant's possibility of employment in Canada. Points are therefore awarded both for occupational demand in the paper screening step, and for experience in the final assessment. The process also requires recourse to the Canadian Classification and Dictionary of Occupations (C.C.D.O.), a seven volume manual which classifies and describes thousands of occupations. Assessment of any one intended occupation begins with a matching of the applicant's work routine with a specific occupation from the C.C.D.O.
