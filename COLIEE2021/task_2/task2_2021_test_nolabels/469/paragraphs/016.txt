Neither the Officer nor the Delegate is authorized or required to make findings of fact or law.  They conduct a summary review of the record before them on the strength of which they express non-binding opinions about potential inadmissibility.  This is no more than a screening exercise that triggers an adjudication.  It is at the adjudicative stage where controversial issues of law and evidence can be assessed and resolved.  As the Federal Court of Appeal held in Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Cha, 2006 FCA 126 at paras 47 and 48, [2007] 1 FCR 409, the referral process is intended only to assess readily and objectively ascertainable facts concerning admissibility.  It does not call for a long and detailed assessment of issues that can be properly assessed and fully resolved in later proceedings.  To the extent that there is any discretion not to make a referral to the ID, it is up to the Officer and the Delegate to determine how that will be exercised and what evidence will be applied to the task.  This point was made by Justice James Russell in Faci, above, at para 63:
[63]  The jurisprudence of this Court makes clear that, when deciding whether to recommend an admissibility hearing, the Minister’s Delegate has the discretion, not the obligation, to consider the factors set out in ENF 6. See Lee, above, at paragraph 44; and Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 429 at paragraphs 22-23. The Minister’s Delegate in this case reasonably concluded that country conditions need not be considered at this stage of the process because a risk assessment would have to be done before the Applicant could be removed.
