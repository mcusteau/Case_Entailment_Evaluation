The Applicants also complain that the referrals of their cases to an admissibility hearing were unreasonable because the responsible officials failed to resolve their legal argument that a false statement made to obtain a permanent residency card does not constitute a misrepresentation under s 40 of the IRPA.  This somewhat convoluted statutory interpretation argument, with variations, was submitted by the Applicants’ legal counsel for consideration in the s 44 referral process [see CTR in IMM-2023-18 at pp 593-599 and pp 413-420].  However, the issue was not resolved by the referring officials on the basis that “these arguments are better to be heard by a Member of the Immigration Division” [see CTR in IMM-2023-18 at p 495 and p 7; and also see CTR in IMM-3629-18 at p 6].
