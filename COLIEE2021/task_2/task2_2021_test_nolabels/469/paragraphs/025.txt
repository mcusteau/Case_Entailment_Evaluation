[25]
The Applicants have proposed nine questions for certification.  In my view only one question is appropriate or needed.  The state of the law concerning the scope of discretion under s 44 to refer a case to the ID for a permanent resident remains clouded.  Indeed, in Sharma, above, the Court of Appeal left that issue for another day.  These may be the cases that are needed to clarify the law on this point.  I will, therefore, certify the following question:
What is the scope of discretion afforded by s 44 of the IRPA to refer the case of a permanent resident to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing on the ground of misrepresentation under s 40 and was that discretion properly exercised in these cases?
JUDGMENT IN IMM-1061-18, IMM-2023-18, IMM-3358-18
AND IMM-3629-18
THIS COURT’S JUDGMENT is that these applications for judicial review are, accordingly, dismissed.
THIS COURT’S FURTHER JUDGMENT is that the following question be certified:
What is the scope of discretion afforded by s 44 of the IRPA to refer the case of a permanent resident to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing on the ground of misrepresentation under s 40 and was that discretion properly exercised in these cases?
