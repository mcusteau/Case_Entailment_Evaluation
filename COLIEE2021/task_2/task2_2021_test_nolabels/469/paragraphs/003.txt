What is also common to all of the Applicants is their employment of the same immigration consultant, namely Xun “Sunny” Wang.  Mr. Wang was running a widespread fraudulent immigration and income tax scheme on behalf of several hundred clients from whom he received millions of dollars in fees.  Mr. Wang’s methods typically involved a falsification of a client’s travel history to overcome a shortfall in Canadian residency as required by s 28 of the IRPA or to obtain Canadian citizenship.  Among other things, Mr. Wang often forged client passport entries and fabricated client employment records.  In many cases evidence was obtained showing that clients were aware of, or actively involved in, the frauds.  For each of these Applicants, Mr. Wang misrepresented residency histories in support of requested renewals of their permanent residency cards.
