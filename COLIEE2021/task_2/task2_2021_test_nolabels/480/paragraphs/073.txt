The respondent Hall may only be removed from office of the Band Chief by the issuance of a writ of quo warranto if the court is satisfied that the respondent Hall has no legal basis for holding this position. Since I have concluded supra that the order of the Elections Appeal Board is invalid, the applicant is unable to rely on the order of the Elections Appeal Board in support of his submission that the respondent Hall is thereby disentitled to hold the office of Band Chief.
