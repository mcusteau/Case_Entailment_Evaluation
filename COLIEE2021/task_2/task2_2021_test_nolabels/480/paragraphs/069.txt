Section 19 of the
Code
empowers the Band Council to develop regulations to give effect to the
Code
. This section reads as follows:
"19. The Council of the Sioux Valley Dakota Oyate will, in advance of the March 1994 election,
develop and submit to the community for approval, regulations to give effect to this Code
and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, will develop regulations with respect to:
(a) nomination procedures,
(b) appointment and tasks of electoral officers,
(c) election procedures,
(d) appointment and tasks of election appeal board members, and
(e) appeal procedures." (Emphasis added) [see footnote 30]
The
Regulations
, included in Exhibit G of the applicant's affidavit, are dated February 8, 1994. There has been no evidence led to rebut the inference that these
Regulations
were not in existence, in their present form, prior to that date. Accordingly, they certainly were not available to voters at the time of the plebiscites. The reason I draw attention to this fact arises from the wording of the above enabling provision. It states that the Council was to "develop and submit to the community for approval" regulations to give effect to the
Code
. The fact that the
Regulations
were not even in existence at the time of the plebiscites eliminates any possibility they received community approval at that juncture. In fact, the applicant did not lead any evidence to support a finding that these
Regulations
were submitted to the community for approval in any manner.
