It is not disputed that the first plebiscite was held on June 28, 1993. The results of the plebiscite were: 128 in favour and 71 against. [see footnote 17] As the number of votes in favour did not constitute a majority of the total number of eligible voters, a second plebiscite was held on July 30, 1993, the results of which were: 13 in favour; two against; and one spoiled ballot. [see footnote 18] Thus, since a simple majority of the total number of votes cast at the second plebiscite was in favour, the Department's policy enunciated, supra, was complied with.
