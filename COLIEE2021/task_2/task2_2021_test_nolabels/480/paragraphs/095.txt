The Elections Appeal Board's order was not rendered until March 26, 1994. Taking into consideration that a reasonable amount of time had to be allowed to permit the Band Council to comply with the order, I am of the view that filing the application for judicial review six months following the election, in these circumstances, was not an unreasonable length of time since the election.
