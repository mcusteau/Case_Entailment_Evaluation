In the case at bar, two plebiscites were held on the Band's reserve, for the purpose of fulfilling this requirement. The Department's policy sets out the procedure to be followed by a band that chooses to demonstrate the support of its membership in this manner. The procedure provided that if those who voted in favour of the proposed repeal and alternate system did not constitute a simple majority of all eligible voters, that a second plebiscite must be held within one month, at which only the support of a simple majority of those who voted was necessary.
