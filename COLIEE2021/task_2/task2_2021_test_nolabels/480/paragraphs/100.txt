Justice Teitelbaum stated in
Jock
, supra, that "[w]here the law provides another remedy, quo warranto may not be used to contest an election". However, he further stated that "[a]ccording to Dussault and Borgeat (supra), the court has discretion to determine 'the appropriateness of requiring that all internal relief avenues be first exhausted' (p. 388)". In my view, in the circumstances of the case at bar, it is not appropriate to have required the applicant to have exhausted this internal relief avenue. Assuming the applicant had been successful in attaining a vote of 65% in favour of removing the respondent Hall from office, it is quite likely the applicant would still be in the position he is today, since the efficacy of this remedy depends upon the Band Council calling a new election. The applicant had already succeeded in obtaining an order of the Elections Appeal Board that a new general election be held. This order was not being complied with. I am of the view the applicant cannot be faulted for failing to exhaust this remedial avenue.
