Following the election, it is fair to say that the applicant acted promptly in submitting his appeal to the Election Appeal Board, at which time he did challenge the respondent's eligibility to hold office as Chief. The applicant submitted his written appeal dated March 18, 1994, only four days following the election. The question arises: does the applicant's prompt response to the respondent Hall's election as Band Chief rectify the applicant's acquiescence in the respondent Hall's candidacy for office? I am of the view that it does not.
