The second major difference between the two versions is of particular relevance to these proceedings. The final version of the
Code
contains the provision, in paragraph 7, that restricts eligible candidates for Chief or Councillor to members who are 18 years of age or over and have resided on the Reserve for the past 12 months, prior to the election date. This is the provision that the applicant relies upon for his assertion that the respondent Hall was ineligible to run for the office of Chief. However, this very provision is
not
contained in the draft version, which the respondents submitted was the version available to voters at the time of the plebiscites. In fact, the draft version does not contain any such residency requirement.
