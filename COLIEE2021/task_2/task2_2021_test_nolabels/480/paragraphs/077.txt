The question remains: as of March 14, 1993, did the respondent Hall reside on the Reserve? According to his own testimony supra, it is apparent that as of March, 1993, the material date, the respondent Hall had not even slept in House 3700. In March of 1993 the respondent Hall was the owner of a house located on the Reserve. He had moved some of his possessions into the house and occasionally ate a meal there. However, at the material time he also held joint title to a home located off the Reserve, in Brandon, where the remainder of his possessions were located and where he and his family slept every night.
