This argument of the applicant is flawed in two respects. Firstly, when the
Jock
decision was rendered, in 1991, s. 18.1 was not even in existence; the section came into force on February 1, 1992. Prior to this, the
Act
did not impose a limitation period in relation to judicial review applications before the Trial Division. Secondly, pursuant to s. 18(3), the remedy of quo warranto may only be obtained by an application for judicial review brought under s. 18.1. Accordingly, it cannot be said that quo warranto is available under s. 18, independent of the constraints of s. 18.1, as was submitted by the applicant.
