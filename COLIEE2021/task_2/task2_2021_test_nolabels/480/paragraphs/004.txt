In accordance with the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs' (the "Department") policy with respect to reversion to a custom system of elections, a plebiscite was held on June 28, 1993, for the purpose of demonstrating the support of the Band membership for a repeal of the s. 74 ministerial order and for an election system to be subsequently employed. A majority of voters in that plebiscite voted in favour of the proposal. However, as fewer than a majority of the total eligible voters voted in the first plebiscite, a second plebiscite was held on July 30, 1993. Again, the majority of voters were in favour of the proposal. Notice of both plebiscites was posted at various locations throughout the Reserve. Only those Band members who resided on the Reserve were permitted to vote in the plebiscites. [see footnote 2]
