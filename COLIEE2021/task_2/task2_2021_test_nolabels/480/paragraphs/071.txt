The applicant appealed the results of the March 14, 1994, election pursuant to s. 15.1 of the
Code
, by submitting a written appeal within seven days of the election to the Election Appeals Board. [see footnote 31] Pursuant to that appeal, the Election Appeal Board issued an order, dated March 26, 1994, declaring that a new general election be held. The power to order a new election is conferred upon the Elections Appeal Board by s. 13(3) of the
Regulations
. [see footnote 32] The
Code
itself does not empower the Board to grant such an order. Accordingly, a declaration of invalidity of the
Regulations
renders the order for a new general election ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Elections Appeal Board.
