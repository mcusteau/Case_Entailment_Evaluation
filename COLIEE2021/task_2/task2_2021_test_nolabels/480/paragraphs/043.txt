Thus, the definition of "elector" in the
Act
did not contain a requirement the elector be resident on the Reserve. However, with respect to specific types of votes, per part (c) of the definition, an elector may be disqualified from voting by a provision of the
Act
. For example, if the vote in question was an election for the office of Chief or Councillor, held pursuant to the
Indian Act
, then per s. 77(1) of the
Act
, as it was in 1993, an elector was disqualified from voting unless he/she was ordinarily resident on the Reserve. [see footnote 19] The
Indian Band Election Regulations
further defined "ordinarily resident" for the purposes of the Band Council elections. Justice Strayer, in
Batchewana Indian Band (Non-Resident Members) v. Batchewana Indian Band
, [1994] 1 F.C. 394; 87 F.T.R. 183 (T.D.), declared s. 77(1) of the
Indian Act
to be in contravention of s. 15 of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[see footnote 20], in a decision dated September 9, 1993. However, Justice Strayer suspended operation of his decision until July 1, 1994, to allow Parliament time to consider amending the
Act
. The applicant's counsel in the case at bar correctly submitted in argument that at the material time, June and July of 1993, s. 77(1) was in effect, as this was prior to Justice Strayer's decision.
