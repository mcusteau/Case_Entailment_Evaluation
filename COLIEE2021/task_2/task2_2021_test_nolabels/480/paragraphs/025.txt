I agree with the respondents' submission that the
Code
and
Regulations
are "nothing more than an attempt to put down in some kind of recognizable and written form the electoral practices of this particular Band". [see footnote 16] There is no requirement under the
Indian Act
that a Band reduce to writing its custom with respect to the selection of the Band's Council. By way of example, if the Band's custom was simply that the eldest child of a Chief or Councillor inherited the position upon the Chief or Councillor's death, it may not be necessary to write this custom into a code or bylaw: such a custom could easily be passed from generation to generation by word-of-mouth. However, the custom of the Band in the case at bar is not so simple, and accordingly the Band has seen fit to formulate a written
Code
and
Regulations
setting out the Band's custom for choosing the Band's Council. The dispute that has arisen is whether or not the
Code
and
Regulations
so developed do indeed reflect the custom of the Band.
