It seems clear that this is a "definition" provision rather than an "empowering" provision. It simply states that a council of a band is either a council chosen according to the Band's custom or, if a ministerial order is in effect pursuant to s. 74(1) of the
Act
, it is a council that has been elected in accordance with the
Indian Act
. It does not confer a power upon a Band to develop a custom for selecting its council. Rather, it recognizes that an Indian Band has customs, developed over decades if not centuries, which may include a custom for selecting the Band's Chief and Councillors. The definition of "council of a band" acknowledges that prior to the enactment of the
Indian Act
in 1951, Indian Bands had their own methods for selecting the Band Council. The power or ability to continue choosing the Band Council in the customary manner is left intact by the
Indian Act
, except in those cases where the power is removed from the Band by a ministerial order under s. 74(1) of the
Act
.
