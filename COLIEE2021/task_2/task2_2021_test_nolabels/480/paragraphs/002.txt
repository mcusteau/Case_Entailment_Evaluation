On March 14, 1994, the Sioux Valley Indian Band No. 290 (the "Band") held an election for Band Chief and Band Council. Elections for the council of the band may be governed by either the provisions of the
Indian Act
, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, (the "

Act
defines council of the band as follows:
"'council of the band' means
(a) in the case of a band to which s. 74 applies, the council established
pursuant to that section
,
(b) in the case of a band to which s. 74 does not apply, the council chosen
according to the custom of the band
, or, where there is no council, the chief of the band chosen according to the custom of the band;" (emphasis added)
Section 74(1) of the
Act
reads as follows:
"74(1) Whenever he deems it advisable for the good government of a band, the Minister may declare by order that after a day to be named therein the council of the band, consisting of a chief and councillors, shall be selected by elections to be held in accordance with this Act."
