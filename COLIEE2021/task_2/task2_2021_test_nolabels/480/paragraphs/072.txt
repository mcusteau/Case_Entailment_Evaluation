In summary, I am of the view that the
Regulations
were enacted ultra vires the jurisdiction of the Band Council, as there is no evidence they were submitted to the community for approval, as is required by the enabling provision in the
Code
. I have the further view that the order of the Elections Appeal Board declaring a new general election be held is invalid. I so conclude because, in the absence of an empowering regulation, the Election Appeals Board is without jurisdiction to grant such an order.
