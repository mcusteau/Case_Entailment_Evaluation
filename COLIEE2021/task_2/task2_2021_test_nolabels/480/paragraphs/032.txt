Accordingly, I do not think that the power of the Band to choose its council in a customary manner is a "power conferred on the Band" as is contemplated by s. 2(3)(a) of the
Indian Act
. Rather it is an inherent power of the Band; it is a power the Band has always had, which the
Indian Act
only interferes with in limited circumstances, as provided for under s. 74 of the
Act
. Thus, in my view the Band may exercise this inherent power unrestrained by s. 2(3)(a) of the
Indian Act
.
