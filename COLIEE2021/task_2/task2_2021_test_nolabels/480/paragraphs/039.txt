In the absence of evidence of the question posed upon the plebiscite ballots, the results of the plebiscite have limited use. At most, the court could infer that as the plebiscites were held for the purpose of meeting the Department's criteria for recommending the repeal of a s. 74 order, and since the order was in fact ultimately repealed, the Department's requirements must have been satisfied. If the court chooses to draw this inference, then the corollary is that the plebiscite indicated support by the band membership of a repeal of s. 74
and
of the election system to be employed thereafter.
