As I concluded above that the
Code
is valid and reflects the Band's custom, it can therefore be said that the Band's custom permits the Band Council to develop regulations to give effect to the
Code
, subject to one condition: the Band Council must submit the said regulations to the community for approval. I am of the view that unless this condition has been satisfied, any regulations purportedly developed pursuant to s. 19 are invalid. Since no evidence has been adduced to establish that the
Regulations
were approved by the community, I am of the view they must be declared invalid. The Band Council acted ultra vires the jurisdiction conferred upon it by s. 19 of the
Code
.
