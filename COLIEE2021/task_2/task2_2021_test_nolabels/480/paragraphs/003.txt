Prior to March 14, 1994, pursuant to Order-in-Council P.C. 4283, dated October 15, 1952, and the
Indian Band Council Election Order
of the Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs (the "Minister"), dated December 14, 1989, s. 74 of the
Act
applied to the Band, and thus per s. 2(1) of the
Act
, Band election procedures were governed by the provisions of the
Indian Act
. However, for approximately 20-24 months prior to the March 14, 1994, elections, the Band considered reverting to a set of election procedures based on Band custom. [see footnote 1]
