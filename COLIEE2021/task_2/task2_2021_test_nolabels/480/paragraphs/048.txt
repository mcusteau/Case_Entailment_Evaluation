I have compared the draft version of the
Code
said by the respondent Hall to have been available at the time of the plebiscites, to the final version of the
Code
. There are indeed differences between the draft version and the final version, some of which are relatively minor, and some of which are quite significant. One significant difference, is the inclusion in the draft version of six provisions regarding conflict of interest. [see footnote 24] These were removed from the final version, and instead form the substance of the third document, entitled
Code of Ethics
. [see footnote 25]
