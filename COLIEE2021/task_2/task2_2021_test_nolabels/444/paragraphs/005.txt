To begin, the subject matter is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Court in that an Election Appeal Board, set up under the
Customs Election Regulations
, as allowed by the
Indian Act
, is a "federal board, commission or other tribunal": see for example
Sparvier v. Cowessess Indian Band No. 73 et al.
(1993), 63 F.T.R. 242 (T.D.), in which the actions of an election appeal board, under a
Reserve Election Act
, were at issue.
