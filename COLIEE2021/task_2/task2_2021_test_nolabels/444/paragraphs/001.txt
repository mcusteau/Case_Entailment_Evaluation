Hargrave, Prothonotary
: In this action, commenced July 13, 1994, the plaintiffs' basic aim appears to be a declaration as to their status as Chief and Councillor following Band Council elections in March 1994. The defendants, by Counterclaim, say that the election was not in accordance with the
Band Customs Election Regulations
, that they filed an appeal of the result, but that nothing was done and further that the ballots were destroyed, with the assistance of the plaintiff, Barbara Allison, one day before a recount was to have been held. The defendants, in their Counterclaim, which the plaintiffs now move to strike out, seek a declaration that the March 29, 1994, election for Band Council is null and void and an Order for a new election. The fact that the defendants seek a discretionary remedy has a bearing on the outcome.
