The third additional reason why I would dismiss the motion is that I question that a pleading ought to be struck out where it is discretionary whether the trial judge will allow the remedy: for example see
Canada (Radio-Television & Telecommunications Commission) v. Teleprompter Cable Communications Corp.
, [1972] F.C. 1265 (F.C.A.), at pp. 1267-1268:
"Turning to the second branch of the case, a preliminary point should be mentioned as to whether the power of a superior court to grant declaratory relief is necessarily ousted where the statute governing the particular matter provides a special procedure in another court in which the question involved might arise. This question was dealt with by the House of Lords in
Ealing London Borough Council v. Race Relations Board
, [1972] 2 W.L.R. 71. In that case it was held that the mere fact that a statute contained provisions governing the procedure for enforcement of an
Act
did not oust the jurisdiction of the superior court to grant declaratory relief. See per Viscount Dilhorne at p. 79. See also per Lord Donovan at pp. 75 and 76."
Justice of Appeal Thurlow, as he then was, who wrote the reasons for the Court of Appeal in the
Teleprompter
case, concluded that it would be wrong to abort the proceedings prematurely by striking out the Statement of Claim. In short, it might well be within the trial judge's discretion to award the relief sought.
