Dealing with the merits of the Minister's application, the Board found it significant that Mr Li had not applied for Canadian citizenship but, rather, decided to maintain his Chinese citizenship through renewal of his Chinese passport. The Board found that Mr Li's conduct showed his intention to avail himself of Chinese, rather than Canadian, protection. It referred to the UNHCR Handbook which states that evidence that a refugee has applied for and obtained a passport creates a presumption that the person intends to re-avail himself or herself of the protection of the issuing state. The person's intention can also be presumed from numerous visits to his or her country of origin. The Board accepted Mr Li's explanation that he initially obtained a Chinese passport in order to travel to the United States, and that one of his trips to China was for the purpose of visiting his sick mother-in-law. However, Mr Li had made at least 17 trips to China for various purposes, including business ventures.
