In any case, while there may be some differences between factual and legal presumptions, that is not the critical distinction here. Factual presumptions generally arise when proof of one fact is presumed to be proof of another. For example, where a person pays for something with a cheque that is later dishonoured, it is presumed that the person acquired the purchased item by false pretences. The presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the purchaser reasonably believed that he or she had sufficient funds to cover the cheque (s 362(4) of the
Criminal Code
, RSC 1985, c C-46).
