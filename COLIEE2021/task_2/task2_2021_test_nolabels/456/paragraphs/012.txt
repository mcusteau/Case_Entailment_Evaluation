The Board noted that the reason Mr Li had not returned to China after 2004 was because he had been arrested in Canada in August of that year, and was subsequently convicted and sentenced for producing, importing, and possessing controlled substances. He served a sentence of more than two years for those offences, and was later subject to parole conditions that prevented him from travelling. Based on this evidence, the Board concluded that Mr Li could not credibly claim that his trips to China were all for legitimate business purposes.
