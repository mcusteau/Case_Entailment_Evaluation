Legal presumptions generally state propositions presumed to be true and create a burden that must be met by those who seek to disprove them - a patent is presumed to be valid, unless there is some reliable evidence to the contrary (brought by the party challenging the patent); a state is presumed to be willing and able to protect its citizens, unless there is clear and convincing evidence to the contrary (presented by a refugee claimant); an accused person is presumed to be innocent unless proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt (by the Crown). These are often more in the nature of broad legal principles, not true presumptions.
