Mr Li argued before the Board that the Minister's decision not to bring cessation proceedings between 2004 and 2013 amounted to a waiver of the right to make an application. The Board disagreed, finding that Mr Li had not been prejudiced by the delay; he had not been able to show that there was evidence in his favour that was no longer available. Further, there was no real factual dispute about the number of trips Mr Li had made to China or their purposes. For similar reasons, the Board found that the delay did not amount to an abuse of process.
