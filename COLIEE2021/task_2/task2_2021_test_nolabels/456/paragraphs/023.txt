Mr Li argues that the delay in bringing a cessation application, from 2004 to 2013, amounts to an abuse of process. The delay has prejudiced him, he says, because he failed to keep the necessary records that would have enabled him to defend himself against the Minister's application. In particular, he no longer has the documents he presented in 2004 in support of his permanent residency.
