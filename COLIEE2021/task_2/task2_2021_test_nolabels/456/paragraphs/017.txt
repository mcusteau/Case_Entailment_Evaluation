In support of this argument, Mr Li relies on the doctrine of
res judicata
, which requires proof that the same issue was already decided, that the earlier decision involved the same parties, and that the decision was final (
Angle v Canada (Minister of National Revenue)
, [1975] 2 SCR 248). I am satisfied that the subject matter addressed in the 2004 decisions did not correspond with the issues that were before the Board. Therefore, Mr Li cannot meet the first element of the test. It is unnecessary to consider the other two.
