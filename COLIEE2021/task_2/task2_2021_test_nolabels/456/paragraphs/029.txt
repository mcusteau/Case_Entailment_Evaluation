In my view, Mr Li's circumstances do not amount to an abuse of process based on delay. In the cases where courts have found an abuse of process, authorities had commenced proceedings but then had not acted on them for many years, to the person's prejudice. In
Fabbiano
, for example, through delay, the applicant lost the opportunity to make submissions on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Here, the decision to bring a cessation application occurred in 2013, and was promptly prosecuted. Further, Mr Li has not stated what difference the allegedly missing documents would have made. Again, the facts regarding Mr Li's travel history are not in dispute. In the circumstances, I cannot see any prejudice to Mr Li.
