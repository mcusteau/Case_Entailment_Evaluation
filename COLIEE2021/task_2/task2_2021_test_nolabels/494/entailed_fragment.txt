I am of the view that the Board erred in finding that the Respondent's trademark VOX was inherently distinctive since it consists of a word that is neither English nor French. It is not an invented word. It is a Latin word the meaning of which is well known. I agree with the Applicant that a word of Latin origin that is defined in the dictionary does not have the inherent distinctiveness attributed to it by the Board (see
Illico Communication Inc. v. Vidéotron Ltée
, [2004] R.J.Q. 2579).

Thus, VOX is a weak trademark that should not receive a large measure of protection.
