In written and in oral arguments, the applicant submitted that there was a likelihood of confusion between its COMPULIFE trademark and the respondent's LIFEGUIDE trademark. The applicant alleged 23 instances of actual confusion between its COMPULIFE insurance software product and the respondent's LIFEGUIDE insurance software product. However, these proceedings concern whether or not to expunge the respondent's COMPUOFFICE trademark, or its ACROSS THE BOARD trademark, from the register of trademarks, not whether to expunge the LIFEGUIDE trademark. The grounds for expungement are to be determined based solely on the wares or services covered by the registration. (
Canada's Royal Gold Pinetree Manufacturing Co. v. Samann
(1986), 65 N.R. 385; 9 C.P.R.(3d) 223 at 231 (F.C.A.)). Accordingly, because the LIFEGUIDE trademark is not the subject of these expungement proceedings, most of the evidence provided by the applicant involving the likely confusion between the COMPULIFE product and the LIFEGUIDE product is of little probative value. The allegations against LIFEGUIDE are dismissed.
