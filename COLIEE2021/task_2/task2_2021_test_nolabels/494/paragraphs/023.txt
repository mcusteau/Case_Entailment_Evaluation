The applicant's customers are sophisticated buyers who understand the difference between life insurance quotation software, and general office management software. There is no evidence before this Court that either trademark refers these buyers to a multitude of sources. For insurance agents and companies, the applicant's COMPULIFE software product and the respondent's COMPUOFFICE office management product are sufficiently distinct to avoid confusion about the source. So this Court finds, and holds.
