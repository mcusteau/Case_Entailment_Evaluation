The foregoing analysis demonstrates that the applicant has not discharged its burden to show that, in all the circumstances, there is a likelihood of confusion between the COMPULIFE and COMPUOFFICE trademarks. Both trademarks have acquired distinctiveness, both were used concurrently without confusion for eight years, both are fundamentally different in nature and application, and both are different in appearance, sound and idea suggested. Given that there are thousands of similar trademarks, and that the consumers of the products are sophisticated purchasers, there is no likelihood of confusion between the applicant's COMPULIFE trademark and the respondent's COMPUOFFICE trademark.
Issue 1(b): Under subsection 18(1) of the
Act
, the COMPUOFFICE trademark was invalid because the respondent was not entitled to secure registration because it was confusing with the COMPULIFE trademark and trade-name previously used in Canada
