Sum-Spec Canada Ltd. v. Imasco Retail Ltd.
(1990), 35 F.T.R. 44; 30 C.P.R.(3d) 7 at 13 (T.D.)).

Sealy Sleep Products Ltd. v. Simpson Sears Ltd.
(1960), 33 C.P.R. 129 (Exch. Ct.) at 135)). Moreover, the respondent submits that when trademarks contain a common element which is also contained in a number of other trademarks, purchasers pay more attention to the other features of the marks, and distinguish them by those features. (
