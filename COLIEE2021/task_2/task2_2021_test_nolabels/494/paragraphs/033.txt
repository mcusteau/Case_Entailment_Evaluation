The evidence shows that the prefix "COMPU" is used in thousands of trademarks, trade-names, corporate names, and domain names in Canada. Given the ubiquitous nature of computers, and society's increasing dependence upon them, it is easy to understand why the prefix "COMPU" has become so popular. Even in the insurance industry, it would appear that computers are becoming the sine qua non of the trade. Therefore, given that the prefix "COMPU" is very popular, it would appear that insurance agents who purchase these products will have to distinguish them based on the other features of the trademarks, namely, their suffixes. Because the suffixes are sufficiently different, it is unlikely that purchasers of the COMPULIFE or COMPUOFFICE software products will think that the trademarks originate from the same source.
