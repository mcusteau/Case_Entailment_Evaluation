On January 12, 1994, the Commissioner of Corrections requested the Chairperson of the Board, under s. 129(3)(a) of the
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
("the
Act
"), to conduct a detention review of the applicant on the basis that there were reasonable grounds to believe that he would likely commit an offence causing death or serious harm before the expiry of his sentence. On the same date, the Chairperson of the Board instructed his officials to hold "... the hearing required by law". One day later, an official of the Correctional Service of Canada gave the Board and the applicant copies of reports and information to be used at the hearing. Certain sensitive issue reports and a letter dated December 14, 1994 from the Metropolitan Toronto Police were withheld from the applicant under the
Act
[see footnote 1] and at the request of the police. The very brief letter from the Metropolitan Toronto Police referred to "an ongoing investigation" into a number of similar offences, including offences allegedly committed while the applicant was on day parole in Hamilton in 1993. The applicant was provided with "a significant gist of the information withheld". Furthermore, the Progress Summary which was disclosed to the applicant in advance of his detention review hearing quoted from the direction of the Board terminating his day parole, indicating that "we have received information that you are being investigated for a number of sexual assaults at this time". The Progress Summary also referred to the subsequent decision of the Board to terminate the day parole of the applicant which contained the statement that "there is an ongoing police investigation of a very serious nature at this time which in our view substantially alters the risk to the community".
