The evidence in the record does not establish clearly why the letter from the Metropolitan Toronto Police was not disclosed to the applicant prior to his detention review hearing. However, I am of the opinion that the inconclusive state of the evidence on this issue is of no consequence. The evidence indicates that the applicant received in his disclosure package more than fifteen days prior to the date of the detention review hearing a copy of the Progress Summary dated December 20, 1993. In the Progress Summary, there are two references to the fact that the applicant was being investigated for further alleged sexual offences. The applicant was therefore provided with a summary of the information contained in the police letter, within the meaning of s. 141(1) of the
Act
. He was informed of the essence of the allegation made against him and cannot be said to have suffered any prejudice by reason of the nondisclosure of the text of the police letter.
