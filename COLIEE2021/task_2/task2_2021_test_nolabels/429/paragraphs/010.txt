The
Corrections and Conditional Release Act
("the
Act
") contains a statutory scheme governing the disclosure to an offender of information to be considered by the Board at a review. In particular, s. 141(1) of the
Act
requires the Board, in mandatory terms, to provide to the offender in writing 15 days before the date of the review "... the information that is to be considered in the review of the case or a summary of that information". Section 141(2) of the
Act
provides an exception to this time period where information comes into the possession of the Board within the 15 days preceding the review. In such circumstances, the
Act
requires the Board to provide the offender with the information or a summary of it "... as soon as is practicable thereafter".
