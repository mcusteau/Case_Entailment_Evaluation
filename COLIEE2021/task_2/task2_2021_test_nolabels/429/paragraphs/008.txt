On February 4, 1994, the members of the Board delayed the detention review hearing by one hour to permit the applicant to meet with his legal assistant. At the outset of the proceedings, the legal assistant of the applicant objected to "... the sharing ... and the timing of recent information" and submitted that the Board had failed to comply with certain provisions of the
Act
. He further submitted that the applicant was not prepared to proceed. The Board rejected his submissions and determined that, under s. 129(7) of the
Act
which imposes a mandatory statutory limitation period for conducting a review, "... a decision would be taken today". The applicant refused to participate and the hearing ended. The Board proceeded to make its decision on the basis of "an extensive file review" of the case history of the applicant. The Board concluded that the applicant would likely commit an offence causing the death of or serious harm to another person before the expiry of his sentence. In its decision, the Board reviewed the circumstances of the sexual assault which led to the imprisonment of the applicant, his unsatisfactory progress in therapy while on day parole, the termination of his day parole due to his investigation for a number of sexual assaults, his new criminal charges and his denial on bail on those charges. The Board also made reference to the recent psychiatric opinion. In its conclusion, the Board stated as follows:
"You present at this time, as an untreated sex offender with outstanding charges including sexual assault and forcible confinement. You have demonstrated little respect for rules of the community in the past (i.e. breach of recognizance).
"The Board concludes that detention in custody is necessary as there is no community residential facility which would serve to protect the public from the risks you present at this time. Residency therefore is not a viable option."
