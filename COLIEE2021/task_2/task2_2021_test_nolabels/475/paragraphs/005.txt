On July 18, 1989, certificates were registered in the Federal Court of Canada pursuant to s. 223 of the
Income Tax Act
certifying that the respondents were in arrears with respect to taxes. As a result of the order, the Minister caused registrations to be made on the title of certain properties of the respondents. By notice of motion dated July 26, 1989 the applicant sought an order that, unless sufficient cause to the contrary be shown, the respondent Duncan's lands described in Instrument No. CT847090 registered in the Land Registry Office in Toronto be charged with the judgment in favour of the applicant in the amount of $517,456.47, together with interest as specified in the certificate dated July 18, 1989. A "Charging Order to Show Cause" was issued on July 27, 1989.
