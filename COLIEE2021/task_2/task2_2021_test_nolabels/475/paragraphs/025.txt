Nor can I overlook the fact that the provision as it now stands has a greater safeguard than its predecessor. Under the
Income Tax Act
as amended, ss. 222 to 228 set out a variety of procedures for the collection of moneys owed to Her Majesty for taxes, interest, penalties or other charges under the
Act
. In 1985 the
Act
was amended and s. 225.1 was added to postpone these collection processes during the time allowed for a taxpayer to file a notice of objection with respect to the assessment or reassessment of his taxes. However, in exceptional circumstances where "it could reasonably be considered that collection of an amount assessed would be prejudiced by the delay", the Minister under the former s. 225.2 could institute collection proceedings. In 1988, the provisions were once again revised and s. 225.2 was amended to require prior authorization by a court before "jeopardy collection" procedures could be initiated. Although previously not required, the present provision requires the Minister to appear in court to avail himself of these special collection provisions if he wishes to do so before the period for filing notices of objection has expired.
