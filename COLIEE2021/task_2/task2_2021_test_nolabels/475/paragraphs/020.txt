In reviewing the authorization granted under s. 225.2(2), it is necessary to consider whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the collection of all or any part of an amount assessed in respect of a taxpayer would be jeopardized by the delay in the collection thereof. McNair, J., in
Danielson v. Canada (Deputy Attorney General) and Minister of National Revenue
, [1986] D.T.C. 6518 at p. 6519; 7 F.T.R. 42; 2 C.T.C. 380 at p. 381 (F.C.T.D.), enunciated the test to be met with respect to the previous s. 225.2(1):
"... the issue is not whether the collection per se is in jeopardy but rather whether the actual jeopardy arises from the likely delay in the collection thereof."
