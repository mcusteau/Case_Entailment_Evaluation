Finally, as acknowledged by counsel for the respondents, the
Charter
does not in specific terms directly affect property rights and I have grave doubts that what took place here constitutes a "seizure". The result of the application was not a seizure in the true sense of the word. Indeed, the taxpayers' assets were not altered in any way and there was no transfer of title. While the filing of a caution on title may prevent or otherwise restrict the disposition of the property, it is far from certain that it constitutes a seizure. I do not believe that activities pursued by the Minister in accordance with the administrative enforcement mechanisms of a regulatory statute that effectively "freeze" a taxpayer's assets constitute a "seizure" in the sense required to bring these activities within the scrutiny of the standards set by the Supreme Court in
