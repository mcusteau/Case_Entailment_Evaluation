Jerome, A.C.J.
: The respondents' applications by way of originating notice of motion for a review, pursuant to s. 225.2(8) of the
Income Tax Act
, of my order dated July 18, 1989 were held together at Toronto, Ontario on January 15, 1990, January 19, 1990 and on April 2, 1990. The order, commonly referred to as a "jeopardy collection order", was granted on an ex parte application pursuant to s. 225.2(2) and authorized the Minister of National Revenue (the "Minister") to forthwith take any of the collection actions described in ss. 225.1(1)(a) to (g) of the
Income Tax Act
with respect to the respondents' tax debt. On August 21, 1990 at Toronto, Ontario, I dismissed the respondents' applications for reasons given orally from the Bench and indicated that these written reasons would follow.
