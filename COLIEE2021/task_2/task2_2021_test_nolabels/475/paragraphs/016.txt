Also, I note that in
Berendt v. The Queen
, an unreported decision of the Supreme Court of Ontario, Eberle, J., expressed similar concerns:
"The notice of motion attacks s. 225.2 of the
Income Tax Act
. I believe that it is misdirected. That section does not provide for anything even resembling a seizure of the money, nor even for the institution of collection procedures. It provides only for a decision of the Minister to override the 90 day delay of collection procedures imposed by s. 225.1. As a result of the decision taken under s. 225.2, it only becomes open to the Minister to take immediate collection actions as authorized elsewhere in the
Act
, if he so desires.
"Thus, [the] attack on s. 225.2 is in my view quite misdirected and fails because of its misconception of what that section does. In spite of that conclusion, it is evident that the applicant really seeks to attack the collection powers statutorily given to the Minister by ss. 222, 223 and 224 of the
Act
."
