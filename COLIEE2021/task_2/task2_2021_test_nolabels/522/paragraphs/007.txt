The Board dismissed his claim; the basis of the dismissal can be summarized as follows:
a) the Board found his testimony to lack credibility. In particular when the Board asked him about the first and last incident that happened to him, he responded with the first and second last incident. If this had been the sole basis of rejection of the claim, this judicial review would have been granted. Of more relevance, the Board found that the lack of objective evidence of abuse and harassment of Hizmet members undermined his claim;
b) the Applicant's story was implausible since his claim of being wanted by the authorities was inconsistent with the fact that he had been released without conditions;
c) the Applicant delayed in leaving Turkey and delayed in filing his refugee claim in Canada;
d) the Applicant's fear of harm does not correspond to a Convention ground, and that documentary evidence does not show that Turkish military authorities systematically discriminate against Hizmet members;
e) the punishment which Mr. Usta faces is not disproportionate to the objectives of the law and the sentences are not so excessive as to be considered persecution;
f) that the documentary evidence does not support a claim that failed refugee claimants who attempted to evade military service, are discriminated against because of their failed claim;
g) the sanctions imposed on draft evaders are not imposed in disregard of accepted international human rights - the punishment was not so excessive as to outrage the standards of decency.
