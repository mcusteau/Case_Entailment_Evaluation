Phelan, J.
: The Applicant made his refugee claim on the basis of both his religion and of his conscientious objection to military service. These grounds were also intertwined with the claim that the Turkish law governing military service and treatment in jails were a basis of a claim being in need of protection. The Immigration and Refugee Board (the "Board") rejected the Applicant's claim which has lead to this application for judicial review.
