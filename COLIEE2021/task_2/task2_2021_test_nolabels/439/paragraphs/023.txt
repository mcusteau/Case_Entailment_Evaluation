In conclusion: (1) it is only minor and inconsequential aspects of the affidavit in question that are based on hearsay; (2) it is at least arguable that the content of the affidavits filed with respect to reviews of visa officer decisions are not governed by Federal Court rule 332(1), but by rule 1603, and that the latter is less restrictive than the former; (3) there is no jurisdiction to strike out affidavits or originating notices of motion in a judicial review proceeding; (4) the appropriate procedure, in general, is to leave the particular affidavit for evaluation by the judge that hears the application on the merits.
