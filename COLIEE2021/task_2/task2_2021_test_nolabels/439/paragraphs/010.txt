[10]
The assertions with respect to which it seemed to be particularly argued that she did not have personal knowledge are found in three sentences in paragraph 6 and in two sentences in paragraph 10 of the affidavit:
"6 ... The applicant advised me that at the third interview the officer advised him that she could understand him but that she would like him to return with an interpreter to ensure that she could understand him 100%. He further advised me that at the fourth interview no interview took place, that he was merely informed of possible refusal. The applicant advised me that he told the officer that this type of meeting did not justify his travel to the United States.
"10 ... He is of the view that he has not accepted an engineering position in Eastern Europe due to his intention to immigrate to Canada, and advised the officer that he had additional investments that he could liquidate if his immigration was granted, investments not affected by the enormous travelling expenses incurred by him in travelling to four (4) interviews."
