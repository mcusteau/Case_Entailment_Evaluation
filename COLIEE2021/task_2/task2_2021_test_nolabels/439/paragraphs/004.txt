The applicant did not, himself, file an affidavit in support of his application. The solicitor who represented the applicant with respect to his application for permanent residence filed an affidavit in his support. That affidavit asserts that while the applicant's English is not as fluent as a native born Canadian, he does not require an interpreter for general conversation. She asserts that, as his counsel, she
always
interviewed him in English
without
the assistance of an interpreter, in fact, that he had been interviewed by the R.C.M.P., in her presence, in English, with respect to unscrupulous immigration consultants by whom he had been victimized. She wrote "I have serviced the client for four years in English
alone
without difficulty". (emphasis added)
