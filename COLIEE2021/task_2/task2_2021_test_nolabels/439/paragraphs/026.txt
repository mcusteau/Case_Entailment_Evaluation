I agree that there is some uncertainty about which provision of the
Federal Court Rules
is applicable to supporting affidavits in these proceedings. I accept that there are two Trial Division decisions that appear to have taken a different approach from that set out in the
Pharmacia
decision. These are on appeal. They are
Moldveneau v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
, supra, and
Romachkine v. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration
(A-412-97). At the same time, so little of the impugned affidavit is of a type that, in any event, could be classified as inadmissible hearsay, that I must accede to the characterization of the motion as frivolous. The costs that are sought will therefore be awarded.
Motion dismissed.
