Second, while the
Immigration Manual
leaves it to the judgment of a visa officer to hold an interview or not, it flags issues which may warrant the need for an interview including the existence of questions or doubts concerning the applicant's bona fides as a visitor, and consideration of a refusal and a need to acquire more information before doing so. In my view, the
Ministerial Guideline
, at the very least, obliges a visa officer to turn his/her mind to the issue of whether an interview should be held or not. The record before me is devoid of any evidence indicating that the visa officer turned her mind to that question.
