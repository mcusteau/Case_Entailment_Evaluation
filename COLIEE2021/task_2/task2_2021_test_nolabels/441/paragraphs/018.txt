In
Wang v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.C.J. No. 95; 199 F.T.R. 302 (T.D.), Justice Rouleau found that the standard of review on the merits of an immigration officer's decision dealing with an application for a Canadian student visa was reasonableness "simpliciter". I find the same standard of review applicable to a visa officer's decision on an application for an employment authorization and a visitor's visa.
