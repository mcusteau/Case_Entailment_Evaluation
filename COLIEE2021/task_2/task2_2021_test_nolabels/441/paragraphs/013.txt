First, I endorse Justice Teitelbaum's comment in
Ali (M.) v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1998), 151 F.T.R. 1 (T.D.), in which he discussed the obligation flowing from procedural fairness which requires that a visa officer apprise the applicant of his concerns. Justice Teitelbaum, following Justice MacKay in
Yu v. Minister of Employment and Immigration
(1990), 36 F.T.R. 296 (T.D.) and Justice Muldoon in
Asghar v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1997] F.T.R. Uned. 450; [1997] F.C.J. No. 1091 (T.D.), was of the view the obligation on a visa officer to apprise an applicant of his concerns was limited and would not include a circumstance where an applicant for a visitor's visa has provided weak evidence supporting his position that he has sufficient ties to his home country to ensure his return because such a concern arises directly from the
Act
or the
Regulations
. Counsel for the respondent argued before me that these were the circumstances at bar. I do not agree.
