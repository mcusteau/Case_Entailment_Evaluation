The decision of the Board rejecting the claim under ss. 96 and 97 of the
Act
is brief. The Board first states that it is not satisfied that there is sufficient credible or trustworthy evidence upon which to make a positive determination. It reviews the impact of Mrs. Ghasemian's representation in presenting her first claim under a false name and reviews the explanations given for her behaviour concluding that it is not satisfied with those explanations.
