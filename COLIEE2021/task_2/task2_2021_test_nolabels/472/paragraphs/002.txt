Mrs. Ghasemian is a citizen of Iran who alleges a well-founded fear of persecution by reason of her membership in a particular social class, namely as a victim of spousal abuse. She also claims a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of religion, because she converted to Christianity while in Canada and now risks severe punishment including death as an apostate if she returns to Iran.
