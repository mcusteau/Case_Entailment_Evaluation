The only finding with respect to s. 97 of the
Act
in the decision is the following:
"For the above reason, and after a careful review of all the evidence, the panel, finds that the claimant failed to establish, on the balance of probability, that she has a well-founded fear of persecution by any reasons enumerated in the Convention refugee definition.
We further conclude that there is insufficient credible or trustworthy testimony upon which to make a finding that the claimant will face risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture.
