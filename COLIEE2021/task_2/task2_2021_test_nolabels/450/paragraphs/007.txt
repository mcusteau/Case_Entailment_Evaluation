Recent jurisprudence of this court has emphasized the need for substantial physical presence in Canada. As stated by Mr. Justice Pinard in
Re Chow
[see footnote 1]:
"There is jurisprudence which does not require physical presence of the applicant for citizenship for the entire 1,095 days, when there are special or exceptional circumstances. However, in my view, too long an absence from Canada, albeit temporary, during that minimum period of time, as in the present case, is contrary to the purpose of the residency requirements of the
Act
. Indeed, the
Act
already allows a person who has been lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence not to reside in Canada during one of the four years immediately preceding the date of that person's application for citizenship."
