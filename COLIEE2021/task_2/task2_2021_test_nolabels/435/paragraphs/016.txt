In conclusion, when read as a whole, the decision is supported by the evidence. I am not persuaded that the Board ignored or failed to deal with the essence of the Applicant's claim. The Applicant has failed to demonstrate a reviewable error in respect of the determinative IFA finding. The error with respect to the Applicant's continuing political profile is not material to the decision.
