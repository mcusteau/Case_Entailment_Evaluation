Whether the Applicant is correct in this assertion is not, in my view, important or necessary for this application. The question of the existence of an IFA is a separate component of the Board's analysis that can stand alone (Tharmaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1995] F.C.J. No. 92 (F.C.T.D.)). Put simply, where an IFA is found, a claimant is not a refugee or a person in need of protection (Zalzali v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1991] 3 F.C. 605 (F.C.A.), Rasaratnam v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 F.C. 706 (F.C.A.)). When looking at the existence of an IFA, the Board could find that the Applicant faced a risk of persecution in Bogra, the Board could assume (without finally determining the question) that he faced persecution or it could ignore the whole question. As long as:
(a) The Board applied the correct test to its IFA analysis; and
(b) Its conclusion on the existence of an IFA was not patently unreasonable, in the sense that it is unsupported by the evidence (Chorny v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2003] F.C.J. No. 1263 F.C.)), Charway v.Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2004] F.C.J. No. 701 (F.C.));
Its decision should stand.
