There was some discussion by the parties as to what inferences, if any, could be drawn in a situation where the Board makes an IFA finding but does not make a clear finding on a claimant's risk of persecution in his home region. In this case, there is no clear finding by the Board that the Applicant faced a well-founded fear of persecution in Bogra. Thus, the Applicant submits that the inference should be drawn that the Board has implicitly conceded that that Applicant has a well-founded fear of persecution in Bogra (Arunachalam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1996] F.C.J. No. 1091 (F.C.T.D.)).
