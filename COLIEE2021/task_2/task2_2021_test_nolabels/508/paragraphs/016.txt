The Notice of Allegation filed by Nu-Pharm Inc. must be reviewed. It reads in part as follows:
"With respect to patent 1181076, we allege that no claim for the medicine itself and no claim for the use of the medicine would be infringed by our making, constructing, using or selling fluconazole tablets by Nu-Pharm Inc.
"The legal and factual basis for the aforesaid allegation is as follows.
"In patent 1181076, the claims for fluconazole are limited to fluconazole made in accordance with processes which are covered by process claims in the same patent.
"If Nu-Pharm Inc. receives a Notice of Compliance for fluconazole tablets before the expiration of patent 1181076, Nu-Pharm Inc. will not and hereby undertakes that it will not use of sell fluconazole made by processes covered by patent 1181076 until after expiry of that patent."
Pfizer alleges that what is missing from Nu-Pharm's allegation is a description of the process it is using. Pfizer then alleges none of Nu-Pharm's allegations are justified for the following reasons:
"Fluconazole is a new substance within the meaning of s. 55.1 of the
Patent Act
. The fluconazole to be sold by Nu-Pharm is of the same chemical composition and constitution as the fluconazole described and claimed in Canadian Letters Patent 1,181,076 and the applicant Pfizer Canada Inc. hereby refers to and relies on s. 55.1 of the
Patent Act
.
"The process used to make the fluconazole to be sold by Nu-Pharm is within the scope of the claims of Canadian Letters Patent 1,181,076 and any manufacture, use, import or sale of fluconazole by Nu-Pharm in Canada of its 50 mg, 100 mg and 200 mg fluconazole tablets infringes the said letters patent."
