The applicants originally requested that Nu-Pharm's entire NDS for its version of fluconazole be produced. In order to narrow the number of documents for the determination of relevance by the motions judge, it was ordered that counsel for the applicants be permitted to view, in the presence of counsel for Nu-Pharm and the Minister, the chemistry and manufacturing portions of the NDS (Part 2). From the review of Part 2, it was determined by the applicants' counsel that only the contents of ss. 2.1.1 (Source); 2.1.3 (Method of Manufacture); 2.1.6 (Impurities); 2.2.1 (Names) and 2.2.10 (Comparison with Innovator) relate to the issue of process of manufacture.
