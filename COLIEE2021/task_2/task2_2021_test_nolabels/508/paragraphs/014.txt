In the case before me there has been some detail of the manufacturing process provided in the Nu-Pharm NDS. However, the drug supplier does not provide the generic drug company with its DMF. Pfizer submits that Nu-Pharm had to supply this information as it is required under Division 8 of the
Food and Drug Regulations
(the "
Regulations
") at ss. C.08.002-C.08.004. In particular:
a. Paragraph C.08.002(1)(a) of the
Regulations
requires that a manufacturer submit to the Minister an NDS having a content satisfactory to the Minister.
b. Paragraph C.08.002(2)(c) of the
Regulations
requires, in part, a list of all the ingredients of the new drug stated quantitatively and the specifications for the ingredients.
c. Paragraph C.08.002(2)(d) of the
Regulations
requires, in part, that the NDS shall contain a description of the plant and equipment to be used in manufacturing, processing and packaging the new drug.
d. Paragraph C.08.002(2)(e) of the
Regulations
further provides that the NDS should contain details of the method of manufacture and the controls to be used in manufacturing, processing and packaging the new drug.
e. Paragraph C.08.002(2)(f) of the
