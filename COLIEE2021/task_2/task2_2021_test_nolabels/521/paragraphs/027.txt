• The Minister's counsel is a hearings officer who represents the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PSEP) in admissibility hearing proceedings and detention reviews before a member of the Immigration Division.
• The hearings officer's main role is to present the PSEP Minister's position to the member of the Immigration Division. The hearings officer is a firm advocate of the PSEP Minister's position, and is subject to the direction of the PSEP Minister. ...
• At an admissibility hearing and/or a detention review, Minister's counsels have an obligation to set all the relevant evidence fairly before the member of the Immigration Division. ...
