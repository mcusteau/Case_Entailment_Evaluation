We understand from the applicant's written representations that he is arguing that the serious questions to be tried are as follows:
a. the Minister's unsworn representative has no personal knowledge of the facts he presents to the Immigration Division and therefore cannot validly tell the tribunal about the CBSA's efforts to establish the applicant's identity;
b. the Immigration Division refused to issue the summonses applied for by the applicant;
c. the Immigration Division [Translation] "denied counsel for the applicant the right to complete his representations";
d. the Immigration Division examined the applicant in the absence of his counsel, who left the room in the middle of the hearing to show his frustration;
e. the Immigration Division proceeded without a Beninese language interpreter;
f. each detention review is de novo.
