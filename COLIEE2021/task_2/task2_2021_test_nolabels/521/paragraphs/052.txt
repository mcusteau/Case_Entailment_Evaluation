[52]
Once again, the Immigration Division's decision in this case speaks for itself:
"Before rendering my decision on the matter, sir, there were some points that were raised during the hearing, as you are well aware. Your counsel made some objections. Firstly, I'll deal with those. Throughout the hearing there were some procedural issues that were raised by your counsel. The first issue being that of an interpreter. Now, as I stated during the hearing,
we have proceeded in the past without the benefit of a Benin interpreter because there was none available
.
There have been efforts made by the Interpreter's Unit to try to find someone who speaks that language who is an accredited interpreter
. It can't just be anybody obviously. Unfortunately, they were not able to find anyone. So,
since you have proceeded in the past with immigration authorities and in front of this tribunal in English, we decided to proceed in English today, and
I explained to you that you could at any point in time raise the fact that there was maybe something you didn't understand and it would be Â repeated for you to ensure that you did understand everything that occurred
