Having reviewed all the evidence before it during the last detention review on December 3, 2008, the Immigration Division concluded as follows:
"...
since the efforts of the CBSA have been reasonable, since I find that your collaboration is lacking to a certain extent, I can't say that it's totally negative, but it is lacking to a certain extent, and since CBSA still has certain avenues which they will follow up on to try to establish your identity in a satisfactory manner, I am deciding to maintain you in detention.
Your case will be reviewed within a period of thirty days. If CBSA is satisfied of your identity before that, you can come back here at an earlier date or request to come back here at an earlier date and your case will be reviewed." (Emphasis added.) (Applicant's record, at page 60.)
