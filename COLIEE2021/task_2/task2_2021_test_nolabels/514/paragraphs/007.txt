Before parting with this application, I wish to acknowledge the difficulties the interpreter faced. First, the hearing was held by way of videoconference. The presiding member and the interpreter were in Montreal, while the claimant and her counsel were in Toronto. At the outset, the interpreter noted the echo caused by the conferencing equipment, stating it was going to be "tough" for the translation. Second, the presiding member, counsel and Ms. Saravia all had to be repeatedly asked to speak in shorter sentences and to allow time for the interpretation. Third, the presiding member himself acknowledged it was "difficult" because he was "giving a lot of things in English". Fourth, counsel for Ms. Saravia (not Mr. Kranc who represented her before the Federal Court) was, at times, singularly unhelpful in providing synonyms to aid the interpreter. The following extract from the transcript is illustrative of his conduct:

A. Onus, okay.
BY PRESIDING MEMBER (to interpreter)
- The burden of proof.
A. Okay.
- Say it differently.
BY INTERPRETER (to counsel)
- So. Well, if you pronounce correctly, I would be able to understand you, so.
A. Are you suggesting that I don't speak English well, madame? Is that what you're suggesting?
- No, I'm just...
