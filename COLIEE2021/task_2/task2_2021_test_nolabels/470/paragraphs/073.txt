The Applicants in the present case also acknowledge that there were irregularities in the conduct of the Referendum Vote:
a. The ballots were not initialled prior to the Mail-in Voting Packages being sent out. The mail-in ballots all had accompanying completed declarations of identity and both the completed and signed declaration and the ballot were placed in a sealed envelope as provided in the Mail-in voting Package, and such sealed envelope was either sent by mail or delivered to the Referendum Officer. On opening each sealed envelope the Referendum Officer confirmed the identification of the voter as contained in the signed declaration, then proceeded to initial the ballot and put the ballot in the ballot-box. No evidence has been led to show that such irregularity would have materially affected the result;
b. The Referendum Officer permitted Nekaneet band members to attend and pick up the sealed envelopes containing the completed and signed declarations and ballots as an equally acceptable process to mailing the ballots to the Referendum Officer. The band members who picked up the ballots included members of the Nekaneet Governance Committee. The Referendum Officer had the authority, under the voting rules, to make his own rules as to matters of procedure in administering the Referendum Vote. No evidence has been led that such procedure constituted an irregularity that would have materially affected the results. Further, no evidence has been led that a voter was denied the right to vote either in person or by placing their mail-in ballot in the mail in the usual course.
