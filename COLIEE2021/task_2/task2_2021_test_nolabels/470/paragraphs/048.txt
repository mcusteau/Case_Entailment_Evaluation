As regards conflicts in the evidence, I think the Court has to take into account the fact that the Applicants have tried their best to put the governance issues before the Nekaneet First Nation so that the whole community can express itself. There were negative votes in the referendum. That suggests an informed community that knew what it was doing and made a free choice. It is telling that the Respondents petition is presented as though there was no dissent, and that raises doubts about how informed and free the petition process was. Either that or it suggests a block of people who have a vested interest in ensuring that the status quo continues at Nekaneet.
