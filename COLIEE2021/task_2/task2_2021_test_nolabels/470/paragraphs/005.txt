The Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development (INAC) has refused to acknowledge either the Applicants or the Respondents as the official Nekaneet band council. INAC regards the dispute as an internal matter and has suggested mediation or an application to this Court to resolve the impasse. Mediation was rejected as an option since mediation cannot change Nekaneet band custom law. The deadlock has caused significant problems at Nekaneet and needs to be addressed as quickly as possible.
