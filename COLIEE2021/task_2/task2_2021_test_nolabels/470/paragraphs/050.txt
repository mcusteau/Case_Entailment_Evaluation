There is no way that the Court can identify, parse and discuss every problem in the evidence and get this decision out in a timely way. Suffice it to say, that I have reviewed the full record and find the Applicants' evidence much more factual, relevant and substantiated than that of the Respondents on the key points at issue. What is more, there is a taint of self-interest and conflict in the Respondents' evidence that cannot be left out of account. The Respondents are obviously wedded to the status quo and have vehemently resisted having governance issues decided by the Nekaneet First Nation as a whole. The Applicants, on the other hand, obviously wish to assume power, but they want to do so under a new system of governance that brings no obvious personal benefit to them and that is an attempt to introduce accountability and transparency to Nekaneet so that dysfunction, self-interest and nepotism can become a thing of the past. Their methodology and process may not have been perfect, but they have been willing to draw the mistakes they made to the Court's attention and, notwithstanding, I believe they have established that a new custom now exists at Nekaneet that is embodied in the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
