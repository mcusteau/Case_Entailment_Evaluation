Simon v. Samson Cree Nation et al.
(2001), [2002] 1 C.N.L.R. 343; 205 F.T.R. 49 (T.D.), where the Electoral Supervisor removed the applicant's name from the list of candidates for council. The applicant argued that the Electoral Supervisor exceeded his jurisdiction in disqualifying her and removing her name from the list of candidates; the Electoral Supervisor submitted that his broad authority over procedure permitted him to do so. Justice Blais rejected the applicant's argument that all provisions in band election laws must be strictly construed, and held that the Electoral Supervisor's position was "the most consistent with the purpose of the Election Law and the intention of its drafters" (paragraph 32). He also referred to the resources that would be wasted if another election had to be held.
