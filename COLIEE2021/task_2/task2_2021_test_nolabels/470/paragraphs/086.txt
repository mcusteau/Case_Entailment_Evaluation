I do not believe that my conclusions prevent the Respondents from asserting what they regard as traditional interests. The
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
have clear provisions for amendments and change. If the Respondents represent a sufficiently broad traditional faction in the community, they can invoke the amending provisions and attempt to win community support for their way of doing things. But the new constitution does ensure that community support is needed and that governance is a matter for the Nekaneet First Nation as a whole and cannot be controlled by an entrenched interest group from either side of the cultural and political divide.
