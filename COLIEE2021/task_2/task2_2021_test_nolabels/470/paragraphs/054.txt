The jurisprudence on what will constitute a sufficient consensus is somewhat sparse, but I think the relevant principles upon which to resolve the present impasse are clear. In
Bigstone et al. v. Big Eagle et al.

"Unless otherwise defined in respect of a particular band, 'custom' must I think include practices for the choice of a council which are generally acceptable to members of the band, upon which there is a broad consensus ... . The real question as to the validity of the new constitution then seems to be one of political, not legal, legitimacy: is the constitution based on a majority consensus of those who, on the existing evidence, appear to be members of the Band?"
