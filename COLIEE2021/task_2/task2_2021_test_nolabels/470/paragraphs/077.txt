A vote will generally not be rendered invalid as a result of irregularities unless such irregularities would have materially affected the results. A succinct statement of this principle may be found at paragraph 20 of
Ta'an Kwäch'än Council, Re
, [2006] Yukon Cases (SC) 62; [2006] Y.J. No. 139; 2006 YKSC 62:
"20. The general common law principle is that the will of the people as expressed in an election will not be set aside unless the irregularity or non-compliance with election law or practice is such that the outcome would have been materially affected. Obviously any irregularity affects the election process in some way. Unless it materially affects the validity of the election results, courts will not set aside the decision of the voters."
