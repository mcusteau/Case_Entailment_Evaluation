This being the case, I think that the easiest way to approach these issues is to decide whether the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
now govern Nekaneet chief and band council elections and, if they do, whether the Respondents rightly occupy their offices in accordance with the relevant provisions. If they do not then, provided the
Nekaneet Constitution
and the
Nekaneet Governance
Act
can be considered as valid and as governing the election of chief and band councils within the Nekaneet First Nation, the Applicants will be the rightful chief and band council because there is no evidence or allegation before me that they were not elected in accordance with the Referendum Band Custom under the
Nekaneet Constitution
and
Nekaneet Governance
Act
.
