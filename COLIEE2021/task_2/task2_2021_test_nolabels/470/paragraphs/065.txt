Had the Respondents been truly concerned with ascertaining the general will of the Nekaneet First Nation on the matters in dispute, they would have placed the issues squarely before the Nekaneet people and either participated in the referendum or found some other way to allow the Nekaneet First Nation to decide these issues for itself. Rather than allow the community to express its will in a fair and transparent way, the Respondents have attempted to thwart the referendum process in order to preserve a status quo that, the evidence suggests, is more conducive to their personal interests. Bearing in mind this general pattern, the Court cannot accept the petition as an indication of how all of the people signing it would have voted in a free and transparent process. It is obvious that the Respondents have family and supporters who will always vote with them. But I do not think the Respondents can have it both ways. They cannot snipe at, and complain of, defects in the referendum process, and then bring forward a petition that was organized and obtained in a way that is not transparent on the evidence. The Respondents cannot boycott and thwart a referendum process aimed at ascertaining the general will at Nekaneet and then offer a petition that has no fair and due process attached to it to support their own legitimacy in the community.
