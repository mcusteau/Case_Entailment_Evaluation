[87]
I render judgment in this case with some reluctance because I am, in effect, pronouncing on the collective will of the Nekaneet First Nation as expressed in a broad consensus vote. That feels presumptuous to me, to say the least. The will of the Nekaneet people, in my view, is a matter for the Nekaneet First Nation. However, counsel for both sides have informed me that the present application is the only viable way of resolving the impasse at Nekaneet over governance in a timely way. I have simply reviewed the materials placed before me and attempted to formulate what I believe those materials reveal concerning what the people of Nekaneet want to happen in terms of governance. I am well aware that Court applications do not reveal everything, particularly summary proceedings such as this judicial review application. Hence, my conclusions will not please everyone at Nekaneet. But taking into account the method of resolution selected in this case, this is the best I can do for the Nekaneet First Nation and I hope that it will bring some respite from the divisiveness that has been hampering the community.
