Generally speaking, this application reveals a personal and ideological struggle at Nekaneet over governance issues. Behind the legalities lie common tensions over such things as custom and accountability, on-reserve and off-reserve interests, traditional spirituality and Christianity, personal interest and community benefit. This kind of summary proceeding cannot address in detail these extremely complex cultural and political flashpoints. In the end they all boil down to the issue of what a consensus of the Nekaneet First Nation wants for itself. A full consensus is impossible over such divisive issues in such a small community. Polarization has led to dysfunctional government, and dysfunctional government has caused problems for the First Nation membership and has begun to deprive the community of the resources it needs to provide services to the people of Nekaneet. It is impossible to please everyone. The only solution is to determine whether there is a sufficient consensus for change.
