I agree with the Applicants that, in order for a vote to be invalidated, the irregularities would have to be more significant that the ones that in fact occurred in this case. In
Keefe v. Pukanich et al.
, [2007] Northwest Terr. Cases Uned. 90; [2008] 4 W.W.R. 112; 2007 NWTSC 90, for example, Justice Vertes would not have set aside an election as a result of numerous irregularities if one of them had not amounted to an abdication of the returning officer's duty, taking the election out of compliance with the statutory requirements.
