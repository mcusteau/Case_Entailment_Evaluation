Nekaneet has approximately 418 band members, of which 267 were eligible voters at the time of the referendum. One of the problems with a group of people of this size is that loyalties will inevitably divide along family and friendship lines. This makes a clear and overwhelming consensus well nigh possible. As can be seen in the present case, there is a marked polarization between those who want to preserve the status quo and those who want a new approach to governance.
