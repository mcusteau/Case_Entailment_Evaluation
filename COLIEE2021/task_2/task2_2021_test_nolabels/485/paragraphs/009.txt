[9]
The applicant raises the following issues:
1) Did the PCDO breach the duty of fairness by failing to disclose to the applicant her risk analysis prior to reaching her decision?
2) Did the PCDO breach the duty of fairness by failing to disclose to the applicant the documents relied on in her risk analysis, thereby depriving the applicant of the opportunity to respond to the materials in question prior to reaching her decision? and,
3) Did the PCDO fetter her discretion in by relying on the CRDD's assessment of the applicant's credibility instead of making her own independent determination?
The third issue was not pursued in oral argument, therefore, I will focus exclusively on the first two issues raised.
