With respect, I agree with McKeown, J. In
Haghighi
, the Federal Court of Appeal considered the decision of an immigration officer on a humanitarian and compassionate ("H & C") application. In assessing the application, the immigration officer relied on a risk assessment opinion prepared by a PCDO at the request of the immigration officer. The risk assessment in
Haghighi
was not the decision under review. The issue was whether the report prepared by the third party, the PCDO, should have been disclosed to the applicant for comment before the immigration officer made a final determination on the H & C application. The Court held that the duty of fairness requires that the applicant be provided with an opportunity to fully and fairly present his case. The Minister had breached this duty because the applicant had not been afforded an opportunity to respond to the PCDO's report before the final H & C determination was made.
