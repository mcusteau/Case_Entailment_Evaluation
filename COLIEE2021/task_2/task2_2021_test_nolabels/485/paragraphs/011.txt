Lemieux, J., has held that the duty of fairness does require disclosure in these situations. In
Soto v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2001] F.T.R. Uned. 950; [2001] F.C.J. No. 1207 (T.D.), Lemieux, J., held that the PCDO is required to provide the applicant with an opportunity to comment on the risk assessment and address any possible errors before the final determination is made. He stated at paragraph 19:
"In my view,
Haghighi
, supra, is directly on point. In this case, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld Justice Gibson's ruling that because of the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in
Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817, the duty of fairness now includes the disclosure of a risk assessment report by a PCDO so that an applicant may attempt to correct errors or to point out omissions in the report, even when the report or risk assessment was based on material supplied by the applicant as part of his PDRCC application and other publicly available information that was reasonably available to the applicant."
