The Federal Court of Appeal decision in
Mancia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [1998] 3 F.C. 461; 226 N.R. 134 (F.C.A.), established a framework for approaching this issue. With respect to documents regarding general country conditions relied upon by the PCDO that were publicly available at the time the applicant's submissions were made, the duty of fairness does not require the PCDO to disclose the documents to the applicant in advance of rendering a decision. The onus is on the applicant to canvass the documentary evidence and to address any concerns in the submissions filed with the application.
