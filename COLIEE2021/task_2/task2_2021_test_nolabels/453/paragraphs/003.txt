On June 19, 2002 the applicants were called in to receive a departure order, at which time they claimed refugee status. In the proceedings before the Immigration and Refugee Board ("IRB") they candidly admitted that they came to Canada solely for economic reasons and that the claim was filed to gain a reprieve from deportation. The claim was denied on March 26, 2003. An application for leave and for judicial review of the decision was dismissed on July 7, 2003.
