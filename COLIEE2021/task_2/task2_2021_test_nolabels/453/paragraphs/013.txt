The applicants submit that the officer's reasons do not disclose a thorough and reasonable examination of the voluminous documentation provided in support of the application for landing. While the officer recognized that establishment was the primary focus of the application, he failed to examine the establishment of the applicants in any depth. Such short reasons, made in generic terms, make it difficult to ascertain whether there has been a reasonable and thorough examination of the application. The reasons do not offer a transparent look at the reasoning of the officer and therefore cannot withstand a probing examination.
