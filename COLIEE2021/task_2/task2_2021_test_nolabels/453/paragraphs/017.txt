As stated by Mr. Justice Sexton, writing for the Court of Appeal in Via Rail Canada Inc. v. National Transportation Agency, [2001] 2 F.C. 25, 193 D.L.R. (4th) 357 at para.21, the duty to give reasons is only fulfilled if the reasons provided are adequate. What constitutes adequate reasons is a matter to be determined in light of the particular circumstances of each case. As a general rule, Justice Sexton noted, adequate reasons are those that serve the functions for which the duty to provide them was imposed.
