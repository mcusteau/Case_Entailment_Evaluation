In a recent decision, Adu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2005), 139 A.C.W.S. (3d) 164, 2005 F.C. 565, my colleague Justice Anne Mactavish found that an H & C officer's reasons were insufficient and could not withstand a somewhat probing analysis where they consisted simply of a recital of the facts and a conclusion. The applicants were unable to know why their application was rejected or how the officer came to her conclusion.
