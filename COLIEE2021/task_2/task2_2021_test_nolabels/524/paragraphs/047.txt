Justice Binnie also developed general principles in
Whiten
relating to punitive damages. As summarized by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in
2703203 Manitoba Inc. v. Parks
, 47 C.P.R. (4th) 276 at para. 38 (rev'd in part 57 C.P.R. (4th) 391(N.S.C.A.)), the relevant factors to consider are as follows:
• Whether the conduct was planned and deliberate;
• The intent and motive of the defendant;
• Whether the defendant persisted in the outrageous conduct over a lengthy period of time;
• Whether the defendant concealed or attempted to cover up its misconduct;
• The defendants awareness that what he or she was doing was wrong; and
• Whether the defendant profited from its misconduct.
