The leading case on punitive damages is the Supreme Court decision in
Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.
, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 595. As stated by Justice Binnie, punitive damages will be awarded against a defendant:
... in exceptional cases for "malicious, oppressive and high-handed" misconduct that "offends the court's sense of decency":
Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto
, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130, at para. 196. The test thus limits the award to misconduct that represents a marked departure from ordinary standards of decent behaviour. Because their objective is to punish the defendant rather than compensate a plaintiff (whose just compensation will already have been assessed), punitive damages straddle the frontier between civil law (compensation) and criminal law (punishment) (
