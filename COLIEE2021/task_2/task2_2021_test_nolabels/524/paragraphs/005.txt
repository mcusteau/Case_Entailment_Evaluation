I direct my mind, first, to the question of service. Were the Defendants served with the Statement of Claim and has the time to file a Statement of Defence passed? I am satisfied that the Defendants were served with the Statement of Claim and that no Statement of Defence has been filed. In the case of the Defendant, Ms. Lin, service was personal. For Mr. Yang, substitutional service was approved by an Order of Prothonotary Lafr√®niere, dated August 13, 2007.
