[57]
The Plaintiffs have submitted substantial evidence with respect to why solicitor-client costs should be awarded in the case at bar. The evidence noted earlier in these reasons demonstrating that the Defendants have knowingly and intentionally infringed the Plaintiffs' intellectual property rights over a long period of time is relevant to this issue.
In addition to that conduct, further examples were provided by the Plaintiffs:
• When approached by the Plaintiffs' hired investigator on May 23, 2007, the Defendant Pi-Chu Lin stated she did not speak English, stated that her name was "Coco" and locked the K2 Fashions store rather than cooperate.
• The Defendant Pi-Chu Lin ran from K2 Fashions when the Plaintiffs attempted to serve her on July 9, 2007. Ms. Lin and other employees at K2 Fashions stated they could not speak English when confronted by a private investigator hired by the Plaintiffs.
• The Defendant, Mr. Yang, stated on April 4, 2006 that he would leave the country if the Plaintiffs pursued him. On May 2007 the Plaintiffs telephoned Mr. Yang who advised he was in Taiwan.
