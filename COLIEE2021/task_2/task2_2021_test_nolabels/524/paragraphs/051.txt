The conduct of the Defendants in this action justifies a high quantum of punitive damages. It is also important and relevant that the Defendants' behaviour has made an accurate assessment of profits impossible. The $87,000 that I will award in respect of the trade-mark infringement is almost certainly below the actual profits. A higher quantum of punitive damages can provide for an overall award that is more proportionate to the actual profits of the Defendants.
