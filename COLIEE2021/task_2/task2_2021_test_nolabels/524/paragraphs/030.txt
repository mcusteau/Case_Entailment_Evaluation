Although the Plaintiffs submitted some evidence on the amount of their damages, I think that they would agree that an accurate or even reasonably-close calculation of damages is almost impossible in this situation. There are two aspects of damages in this situation. The first is the depreciation of goodwill (which, indirectly, results in loss of sales of legitimate LV merchandise) and the second is the direct loss of sales. While it is self-evident (at least to any person who is interested in high-fashion accessories) that the sale of counterfeit LV goods results in a depreciation of the goodwill attaching to the LV Trade-marks, quantification of the amount of such depreciation - if at all possible - would require a much more complete record.
