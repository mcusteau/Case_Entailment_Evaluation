As noted above, I am satisfied that the Defendants have infringed the LV Trade-marks on at least six occasions since March 17, 2006. The Plaintiffs are entitled to an award in damages or profits in respect of the infringing activities (
Trade-marks Act
, s. 53.2). The only question remaining is to assess the amount of either damages or profits.
