[4]
On a motion for default judgment, where no Statement of Defence has been filed, every allegation in the Statement of Claim must be treated as denied. A plaintiff must first establish that the defendant was served with the Statement of Claim and has not filed a defence within the deadline specified in Rule 204 of the
Federal Courts Rules
, SOR/98-106. Evidence must be led that enables the Court to find, on a balance of probabilities, that infringement has occurred within the meaning of the relevant statute (in this case, the
Trade-marks Act
and the
Copyright Act
.) In this regard, see, for example,
McInnes Natural Fertilizers Inc. v.
Bio-Lawncare Services Inc
., 2004 FC 1027, 260 F.T.R. 11 at para. 3;
Ragdoll Productions (UK) Ltd. v. Jane Doe
, 2002 FCT 918, 21 C.P.R. (4th) 213 (T.D.) at paras. 23 and 25.
