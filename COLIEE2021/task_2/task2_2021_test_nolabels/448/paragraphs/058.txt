The U.S. '651 patent discloses that pure optical isomers of this compound could be synthesized, but the process was "tedious and economically impractical using presently available techniques." Dr. Caldwell states that the ability of a chemist skilled in the art to resolve a racemate into its optical isomers is not diminished by the difficulty of designing an economically feasible production process to produce the pure enantiomer on a commercial basis.
