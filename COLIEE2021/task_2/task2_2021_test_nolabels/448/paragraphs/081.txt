Dr. Klibanov's statements in his affidavit support the position that the exact properties of the S(-) isomer, compared to the R(+) enantiomer and racemic ofloxacin, were only discovered through testing. However, he makes no comment as to whether these properties were unexpected, superior or of special advantage in comparison to the benefits already disclosed by the parent compound of ofloxacin. In fact, he repeats over and again the view that the exact nature of the properties of the S(-) enantiomer would not have been known without experimentation. The affidavit of Dr. Wendy Arnott, a Janssen-Ortho Vice-President, addresses toxicity, but only with respect to Novopharm's allegation that the toxicity data set out in the '080 patent are misleading and false.
