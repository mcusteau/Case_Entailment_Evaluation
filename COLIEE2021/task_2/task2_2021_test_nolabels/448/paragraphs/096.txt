Novopharm's expert, Dr. Caldwell, attests that levofloxacin, as disclosed in the '080 patent, was anticipated by the '840 ofloxacin patent. Dr. Caldwell's position is that a chemist reading the '840 patent (and by implication, its U.S. counterpart, the '892 patent) would "immediately understand" that ofloxacin possesses a single chiral centre and based solely on its chemical structure, it would be apparent to a chemist that there must exist two enantiomers, or optical isomers. Dr. Caldwell also attests that the enantiomeric nature of ofloxacin was expressly disclosed in a publication by Osada et al. in 1983, "Antimycoplasmal Activity of Ofloxacin", where ofloxacin is identified using the (Â±) symbol. The use of this symbol indicates that the authors of this article recognized the existence of both the (+) and (-) enantiomers of ofloxacin.
