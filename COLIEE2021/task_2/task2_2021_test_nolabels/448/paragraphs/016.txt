The applicant also relies on the Supreme Court of Canada decisions of
Monsanto Canada Inc. et al. v. Schmeiser et al.
(2004), 320 N.R. 201; 2004 SCC 34, and
Apotex Inc. and Novopharm Ltd. v. Wellcome Foundation Ltd.
, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 153; 296 N.R. 130, arguing that they indicate that the burden of demonstrating invalidity is on the person attacking the patent, that is the second person, or respondent, in a NOC proceeding. The applicant also says that the language used by the Supreme Court in these decisions indicates that the determination of invalidity can only be made after the Court is satisfied that the Commissioner of Patents was "clearly wrong", or made an unreasonable decision in granting the patent in the first place. The applicant submits that the reasoning of the Supreme Court in these patent actions applies equally to NOC proceedings.
