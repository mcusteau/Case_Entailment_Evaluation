With regard to the toxicity findings, Dr. Caldwell attests that the comparative toxicity findings set out in the '080 patent are not at all significant for pharmaceutical formulation purposes, since therapeutic agents use concentrations of the drug substance at levels substantially below their "acute toxicity levels". This statement was not damaged on cross-examination. Further, Dr. Caldwell noted that based on the prior art it would be expected that a single enantiomer of an optically active compound would exhibit lower toxicity than its racemate.
