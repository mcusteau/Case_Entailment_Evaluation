Novopharm argues that Janssen's contention that claims 2, 4, 6, 8 , 9 and 18 comprise all forms, including various hydrates, solvates or polymorphic forms of levofloxacin, cannot stand. In view of Janssen's expert's opinion that approximately 90 per cent of the molecules are S(-) optical isomers of ofloxacin, the patent claims cannot reach as far as covering the hemihydrate form of levofloxacin, since for the hemihydrate form to exist, the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin would be linked with 1/2 mole of water, meaning that 1/3 of the molecules in the hemihydrate form of levofloxacin would not meet the definition of the S(-) enantiomer claimed in the patent.
