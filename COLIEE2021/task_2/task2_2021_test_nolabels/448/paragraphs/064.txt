The Repta article and U.S. patents support Dr. Caldwell's position that there were various known techniques for isolating enantiomers of racemic compounds in the early 1980s. Dr. Klibanov, on cross-examination, admitted that the optical purity that he believed the '080 patent was addressing was at least 90%, and he recognized that 100% optical purity of an enantiomer is virtually impossible to achieve and is more a theoretical concept.
