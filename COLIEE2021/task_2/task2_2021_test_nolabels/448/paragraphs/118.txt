As explained by Dr. Arnott, the acute intravenous toxicity of a substance is determined by administering a range of doses of the substance to test animals and recording the number of test animals that died at each particular dose. This mortality data is used to calculate the LD50 for a substance - the measure of the dose that was administered where the dose was lethal to 50 per cent of the animals tested. LD50 values are typically expressed in units of milligrams of the drug administered per kilogram of test animal mass (mg/kg). A higher LD50 value indicates that a substance is less toxic whereas a lower value indicates less toxicity.
