I prefer Dr. Caldwell's evidence that the purportedly superior qualities of the S(-) enantiomer of ofloxacin with respect to antimicrobial activity set out in the '080 patent are not actually different, or of a special and unexpected nature, from the properties set out in the prior art, including in the '840 patent detailing the nature of ofloxacin. From Repta et al., the above-mentioned U.S. patents, and the two Gerster references, I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities that it would have been obvious to the skilled chemist that one of the enantiomers of racemic ofloxacin could exhibit higher beneficial properties and that all that would be needed to confirm this was to conduct routine, simple testing. Determining and noting which enantiomer possessed higher antimicrobial activity, a quality already existing in the racemate, did not require inventive ingenuity.
