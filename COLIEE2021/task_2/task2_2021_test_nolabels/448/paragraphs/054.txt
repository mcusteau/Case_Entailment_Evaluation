[54]
With regard to Janssen's contention that if experimentation or testing is required in order to determine the invention, the resulting invention cannot be said to be obvious, I am persuaded by Novopharm's submission that the test for obviousness does not exclude routine testing to determine characteristics of known compounds, not undertaken for the purpose of "searching for something novel", but rather for the purpose of verifying the actual attributes of already known compounds, where the results indicate no new uses or surprising results, or properties that are clearly superior to the already known parent compound. Concerning the issue of determining whether there has been an inventive step or "undue experimentation" in the obviousness inquiry, see the reasoning of Justice Dawson of this Court in
Pfizer Canada Inc. et al. v. Apotex Inc. et al.
(2002), 225 F.T.R. 1; 22 C.P.R.(4th) 466 (T.D.), at paras. 103-114.
