Novopharm relies on the following passage from
Fox
, supra, at page 90:
"Selection patents are more usually met with in the chemical, than in the other arts.
If
for practical purposes
it is not obvious
to skilled chemists in the state of chemical knowledge existing at the date of a selection patent
that the selected components
possess a special property
, there is then, or at least there may be, a sufficient inventive step to support the patent.
But mere verification is not invention
. Where the method of manufacture is laid down in the originating patent, the selection patent must not be an exact reproduction of the same process coupled with a statement of the properties possessed by the selected bodies.
No man can have a patent merely for ascertaining the properties of a known substance.
