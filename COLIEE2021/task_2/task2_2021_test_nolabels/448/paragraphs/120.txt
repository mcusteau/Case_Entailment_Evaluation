Having reviewed the cross-examination of Dr. Arnott, where Novopharm's counsel drew her attention to LD50 values for oral administration to male mice that appear to show that levofloxacin has greater toxicity than ofloxacin, I do not accept Novopharm's contention that the data in the '080 patent is either incorrect or misleading. Dr. Arnott explained that doses of levofloxacin would appear more toxic when administered orally due to the fact that it is approximately ten times more soluble in water than ofloxacin and a greater amount is absorbed than when the drug is injected intravenously. The patent disclosure indicates that the acute toxicity results were "determined in mice by intravenous administration" and does not purport to offer toxicity data in relation to oral administration. While the data compiled in the product monographs for FLOXIN and LEVAQUIN appear to offer conflicting conclusions in relation to the oral dosages given to mice, the '080 patent does not purport to relate to such oral administration.
