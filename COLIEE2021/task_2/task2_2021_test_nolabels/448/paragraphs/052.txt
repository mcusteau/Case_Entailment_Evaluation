In that case, the compound described in the subsequent patent was not described in the original patent, and neither were "its superior and previously unknown efficacy" previously known. The Court there relied upon expert evidence that described the surprising features of fluconazole, and the discovery that it was soluble in water as compared to the earlier disclosed compound that was virtually insoluble. Justice Richard concluded that since fluconazole had "unexpected and valuable properties which are not possessed by the structurally closest compounds disclosed" in the original, prior patent, it was not invalid on the grounds of either obviousness or anticipation.
