Novopharm submits that its levofloxacin hemihydrate product will not infringe claim 17 because it will be made using the free acid form of the compound and not a salt of the compound. No salt is present in the Novopharm formulation. Novopharm stresses that claim 17 must be read with claim 18, in that claim 17 requires, due to the word "and", the presence of "pharmaceutical salts" of the compound defined in claim 2, wherein that compound is a hydrate. Counsel stressed that the language in claim 18 where "or" is used, must be evaluated and contrasted with claim 17, indicating that the preparation claimed in 17 is the compound described in claim 2 only when it is in a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt
form.
