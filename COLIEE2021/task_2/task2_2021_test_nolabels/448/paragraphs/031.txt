This construction of the '080 patent is similar to that employed by Judge Keeley of the U.S. Northern District Court of West Virginia in
Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical Inc. et al. v. Mylan Laboratories Inc. et al.
(2003), 267 F.Supp.2d 533 (N.D. W. Va.), where the U.S. patent [see footnote 1] to levofloxacin was challenged. While this Court is in no way bound by the
Mylan
decision as a precedent and is conscious of the differences between Canadian and U.S. patent law, the reasoning was of general use to this Court in construing the '080 patent.
