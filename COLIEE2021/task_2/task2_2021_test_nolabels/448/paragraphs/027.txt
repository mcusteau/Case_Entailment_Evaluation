Novopharm contends that all of the claims of the patent to a S(-) compound - without the limitation that it be pure, partially purified or isolated, or unaccompanied by the R (+) compound - cover the racemate, ofloxacin. The drafter of the claims erred, it argues, in not incorporating any purity limitation. Accordingly, Novopharm contends that the claims as written read on the racemate and there is nothing novel in the compounds claimed and the claims cannot be saved by the patent disclosure.
