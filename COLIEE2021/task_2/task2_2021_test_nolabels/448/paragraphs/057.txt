Dr. Caldwell, at paragraphs 72-73 of his affidavit, refers to U.S. Patent 4,314,081, which states that with respect to the racemic compound in question, it "can be resolved into its individual d and l isomers by methods well known in the art, particularly, by forming salts with optically active acids and separating the salts by crystallization." This '081 patent was not one of the references cited by the respondent in its NOA and in keeping with the decision of the Federal Court of Appeal in
AB Hassle et al. v. Canada (Minister of National Health and Welfare) et al.
(2000), 256 N.R. 172; 7 C.P.R.(4th) 272 (F.C.A.), the respondent may not rely upon it as prior art. However, I find it useful as an illustration of Dr. Caldwell's evidence that the knowledge of how to resolve racemic optical isomers was common prior to 1985.
