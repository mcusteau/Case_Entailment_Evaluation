Dr. Caldwell, on the other hand, describes flumequine as a "structurally similar" antimicrobial compound to racemic ofloxacin. He claims that Dr. Klibanov has "inverted" the diagram of flumequine contained in his affidavit. The Gerster abstract reference revealed that in isolating both optical isomers of flumequine, the (-) isomer had "potent antibacterial activity" and the (+) isomer only "very weak activity". The Gerster poster presentation disclosed both a method for separating the enantiomers of racemic flumequine and that the differential antimicrobial activity of the (-) enantiomer was about two times greater than that of racemic flumequine and between 10 to 100 times greater than the (+) enantiomer. Dr. Caldwell goes into some detail as to why these results would be applicable to ofloxacin.
