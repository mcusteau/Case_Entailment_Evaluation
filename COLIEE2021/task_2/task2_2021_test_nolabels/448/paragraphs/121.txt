Janssen bears the legal burden of demonstrating that the allegations are not justified, and their witness, Dr. Arnott, withstood the cross-examination of Novopharm by adequately explaining the difference in the results between oral and intravenous administration of dosages. Moreover, Novopharm continues to have an evidentiary burden and did not put forth any affidavit evidence of its own to counter Dr. Arnott's conclusions. Therefore, I am satisfied that Janssen has demonstrated that Novopharm's allegation of invalidity on this ground is not justified.
