Dr. Arnott attested that the '080 patent correctly set out that testing done on mice by intravenous administration indicated that levofloxacin was less acutely toxic than ofloxacin. She referred to Table 3 in the '080 patent at page 21 of the patent. At the 200 mg dose level, two out of five mice died when administered racemic ofloxacin, three out of five died when given the R(+) enantiomer of ofloxacin and no deaths occurred of five tested when the S(-) enantiomer was administered. Dr. Arnott also referred to the product monographs for FLOXIN (the brand name for racemic ofloxacin) and LEVAQUIN (levofloxacin), as demonstrating that the acute intravenous toxicity of levofloxacin was less than that of ofloxacin.
