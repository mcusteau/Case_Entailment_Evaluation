Turning first to obviousness, the Federal Court of Appeal in
Diversified Products Corp. and Brown Fitzpatrick Lloyd Patent Ltd. v. Tye-Sil Corp.
(1991), 125 N.R. 218; 35 C.P.R.(3d) 350 (F.C.A.), described the requirement that an invention not be obvious at page 365 [C.P.R.]:
"There is no specific section in the
Patent Act
relating to the requirement for inventiveness or inventive ingenuity, but it has been held and is no longer questioned that by use of the words 'invention' and 'inventor' throughout the
Act
, inventiveness or inventive ingenuity is required to obtain a valid patent ..."
