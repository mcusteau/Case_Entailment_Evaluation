With respect to the remainder of the references cited by Novopharm, Janssen maintains that they do not disclose the beneficial properties of the S(-) optical isomer, since these were only ascertainable through separating the isomer from the racemate and performing multiple experiments with the S(-) and R(+) enantiomers and racemic ofloxacin. The applicant submits that it was only after the S(-) optical isomer was "made" and then experimentation performed, that the invention, that is levofloxacin as a separate compound having certain benefits, was discovered. This discovery has enough inventive ingenuity to demonstrate that the patent claims are not obvious.
