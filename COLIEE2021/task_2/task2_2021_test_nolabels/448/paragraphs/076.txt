On cross-examination, it was apparent that Dr. Schroeder's search was not as thorough as one would reasonably have expected. He did not keep copies of his search results, or the search terms that he used with the various on-line databases. Moreover, he did not have much first-hand knowledge about certain searches for the Gerster references performed by a librarian who was under his supervision. Accordingly, I find that Dr. Schroeder's search was not as "reasonable and diligent" as one would expect of a skilled workman:
