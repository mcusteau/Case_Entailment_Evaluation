That case involved an issue of public law. So also does this case, but here the issue concerns the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
. The process in this case and the judgment now rendered resolve difficult issues on which opinion among members of the public appears deeply divided, essentially on the basis of a decision made by the executive branch of government in relation to a claim by one citizen. There is no decision of Parliament to be assessed. There is no considered decision by this court after adjudication of facts and argument in relation to the
Charter
. Whether the process here followed is appropriate in resolving
Charter
issues, even though the resolution and the judgment rendered are technically binding only for the benefit of the plaintiff, is an issue open for debate that may yet require appropriate refinement.
