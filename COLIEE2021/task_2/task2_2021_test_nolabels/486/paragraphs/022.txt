Of course, the
Charter
issue in that case differs from those raised in this one. In
Muldoon
the issue was whether an express statutory prohibition from voting by judges appointed by the Governor-in-Council was valid in light of s. 3 of the
Charter
which provides that "Every citizen of Canada has the right to vote in an election of members of the House of Commons or of a legislative assembly ...". Here the policies and actions taken under them which give rise to the plaintiff's claims for relief are not directly dealt with by express words of the
Charter
, in particular s. 15(1) which provides:
"15(1) Every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination and, in particular, without discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability."
