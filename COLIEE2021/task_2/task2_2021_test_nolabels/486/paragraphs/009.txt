On June 8, 1989, the plaintiff, in writing, indicated her acceptance of release from the Canadian Forces but noted
"the inability of the CF to clearly define an equitable policy on homosexuality, and the decision to invoke an interim policy that is archaic, discriminatory and blatantly unjust reveals the true ignorance of the CF on this issue. As there is not alternative, I reluctantly accept a 5d release."
The plaintiff was released from the Armed Forces on August 20, 1989. About a month prior to her release she was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant with a retroactive pay increase effective May, 1988, when she ought to have been promoted.
