In
Neilsen v. Canadian Human Rights Commission
, [1992] 2 F.C. 561; 53 F.T.R. 216 (T.D.), Mr. Justice Muldoon declined to issue orders in the nature of certiorari and mandamus in relation to action by the Human Rights Commission to suspend investigation or hearing of a complaint of discrimination in employment on the grounds of sex, sexual orientation, marital status and family status. The Commission had held action on the complaint pending determination by the Supreme Court of Canada in
Mossop
, supra, whether the Commission's jurisdiction should be interpreted to proscribe discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation. The
Canadian Human Rights Act
did not, and does not now, expressly prohibit discrimination in employment on grounds of sexual orientation. The relief sought required the reading into, or interpretation of the
Act
as including such a prohibition, a step Muldoon, J., declined.
