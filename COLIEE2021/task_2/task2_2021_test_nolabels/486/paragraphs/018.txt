[18]
The manner in which the claims here raised were resolved leaves open for debate an issue of policy. In the ordinary course of settlement of issues that are the subject of litigation between private parties the court called upon to play a role in that settlement by pronouncing a judgment on consent of the parties does not look beyond the terms of judgment agreed upon, provided the relief granted is within the scope of that prayed for in pleadings and might have been granted after trial of the action. If that is the case, the court does not have any duty to question a consent by the parties to the judgment, even where the Crown is one of the parties represented by its legal advisors (
Galway v. M.N.R.
, [1974] 1 F.C. 600 (C.A.), reconsidering [1974] 1 F.C. 593 (C.A.)). Rule 340 of this court's
Rules
provides that where there is an attorney or solicitor on the record for the defendant, no judgment shall be given by consent unless the consent of the defendant is given by that attorney or solicitor. That rule was met on this occasion with the joint submission of counsel for both parties that judgment be granted in the terms agreed upon between them. The only other limitation on possible judgments on consent, apparent from some of the jurisprudence of this court, concerns consent judgments against the crown for the payment of money, including judgments in relation to the amount of compensation to be paid under the
Expropriation Act
, where cases suggest that at the very least the court should be satisfied that the facts and the law warrant the conclusion represented by the judgment (See, e.g.
Elliott v. The Queen
(1979), 17 L.C.R. 97 (F.C.T.D.);
R. v. Stevenson Constr. Co. Ltd. et al.
, [1979] C.T.C. 86; 79 D.T.C. 5044; 24 N.R. 390; 79 D.T.C. 5044 (F.C.A.);
