While her release from the Forces because of engaging in homosexual activities was under consideration, a separate investigation was initiated with respect to the plaintiff's security clearance. This was initiated because it was believed the plaintiff accessed and reviewed a classified report and divulged information regarding the contents of the report, contrary to security procedures. On April 4, 1989, a security clearance review board recommended that, because of a demonstrated disregard for security regulations and apparent strong loyalty to members of the homosexual community, the plaintiff be denied any level of security clearance. This recommendation was approved on April 17 and on April 20 the plaintiff was advised that her security clearance had been revoked. On May 25 a career review board was convened to consider the effect of this decision on the plaintiff's career and it recommended that she be released from the Canadian Forces since she was not employable because of the loss of her security clearance, a recommendation approved on June 16, 1989. No action was taken directly in relation to this recommendation since the plaintiff was then in the process of being released pursuant to the Canadian Forces interim policy.
