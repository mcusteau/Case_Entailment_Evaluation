In
Nemeth v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
, [2003] F.C.J. No. 776; 233 F.T.R. 301; 2003 FCT 590, the refugee claimants themselves waived counsel, who could not be present on the date scheduled for hearing. The Court therefore judged that that right had not been denied to them, since they themselves had chosen to proceed. Nevertheless, in the absence of counsel, the Court held that the Board had an even greater duty of fairness:
"The Board was aware that the Nemeths had been represented up until just prior to the hearing. It was, or should have been, alive to the risk that the claimants were ill-prepared to represent themselves. Under the circumstances, it had an obligation to ensure that the Nemeths understood the proceedings, had a reasonable opportunity to tender any evidence that supported their claim and were given a chance to persuade the Board that their claims were well-founded. [paragraph 10]
"... the Board's freedom to proceed in the absence of counsel obviously does not absolve it of the overarching obligation to ensure a fair hearing. Indeed, the Board's obligations in situations where claimants are without legal representation may actually be more onerous because it cannot rely on counsel to protect their interests." (paragraph 13)
