No assurances are provided to the principal applicant, his family members or this Court as to when the CSIS and RCMP "results" might be received. The respondent appears content to respond to the applicants and this Court "when she is ready". In the meantime, she urges that we all "be patient". As indicated earlier in these reasons, in the meantime, the principal applicant's children are aging with the result that more might cease to be eligible for sponsorship to Canada by the principal applicant. The time that the principal applicant and his family members have been separated from one another continues to lengthen. And the respondent continues to hold any identity documents that might conceivably facilitate a reunion, somewhere, between the principal applicant and his spouse and children.
