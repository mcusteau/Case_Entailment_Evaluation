Four points from the foregoing quota­tion from the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement accompanying amendments to the
Immigration Regulations
, 1978 as they relate to the definition "member of the un­documented Convention refugee in Canada class" are worthy of note. First, as at the date of the implementation of the UCRCC program, the class in question was not small: it was estimated to include approximately 7,500 refugees in Canada whose country of origin was Somalia or Afghanistan and who had not been granted permanent residence due to a lack of satisfactory identity docu­ments. That number does not reflect the number of dependants both within Canada and outside Canada who had not themselves been found to be Convention refugees. Second, the government was contemplating the reduction of the waiting period for mem­bers of the UCRCC from five years to three years. Third, the class hardly benefits depen­dants outside Canada. Fourth, the waiting period was intended to be used to allow identification of non-deserving claimants. There was no evidence before the Court in this matter to demonstrate that the waiting period had been so used by the respondent in the case of the principal applicant. To the contrary, the respondent would appear to have adopted an entirely passive role throughout the waiting period.
