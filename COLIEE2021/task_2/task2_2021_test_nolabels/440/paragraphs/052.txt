Relief in the nature of mandamus, beyond what I am prepared to grant regarding return of identity documents, is more problematic. In
Apotex Inc. v. Merck & Co. and Merck Frosst Canada Inc.
[see footnote 9], Mr. Justice Robertson, for the Court, described "several principal requirements" that must be satisfied before mandamus will issue. Given the reliefs that I am prepared to provide, against those principal requirements, I am not satisfied that further relief by way of mandamus is here justified.
