I am satisfied that precisely the same can be said here. To paraphrase the words of Madame Justice L'Heureux-Dubé, it would be unfair for a person or persons subject to a decision such as this one which is so critical to the future of the principal appli­cant and his family members not to be told why the result was reached. On this basis as well, I am satisfied that the respondent erred in a reviewable manner in not providing reasons for the rejection of the various ident­ity documents provided by him, other than the marriage certificate and identity booklet where reasons were provided.
