[29]
Neither party to this application for judicial review, either in written material or through counsel during the hearing, ques足tioned this Court's jurisdiction to deal with this application for judicial review of what the applicants, in their application for judi足cial review, described as a "non-decision of the respondent" and what I, in an earlier decision, [see footnote 4] described as a "course of conduct". On the facts of this matter, there were at least three decisions within the context of the "non-decision" or "course of conduct"; two rejections of ident足ity documents prior to the date of filing of the application for judicial review, and a further rejection of an identity document following commencement of the application. Each of the three decisions was carefully described as not being a definitive rejection of the principal applicant's application for landing under section 46.04 of the
Immigra足tion Act
