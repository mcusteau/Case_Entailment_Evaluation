I am satisfied the Court can order the return to the principal applicant of his seized identity booklet and his marriage certificate. The seizure of those documents was purportedly effected under subsection 110(2) of the
Immigration Act
. The relevant por­tions of that subsection read as follows:
"(2) An immigration officer may
. . . . .
(b) seize and hold at a port of entry or any other place in Canada any thing or document if the immigration officer believes on reasonable grounds that that action is required to facilitate the carry­ing out of any provision of this Act or the regulations; and"
"(2) L'agent d'immigration a le pouvoir:
. . . . .
b) de saisir et retenir, à un point d'entrée ou ailleurs au Canada, tous objets ou documents, lorsqu'il a des motifs raison­nables de croire qu'une telle mesure s'impose pour faciliter l'application de la présente loi et de ses règlements;"
While the seizure may have been appropriate as being "... required to facilitate the carry­ing out of any provision of this
Act
or the
Regulations
", there is no evidence before the Court that the documents were so used after their seizure given that they were never submitted for verification. In the circum­stances, regardless of whatever worth these documents might have to the principal appli­cant, I can see no justification for the con­tinued retention by the respondent. [see footnote 8]
