Further, the respondent provided no explanation whatsoever, at least none that is before the Court, for the rejection of certain of the other identity documentation that was presented by the principal applicant at the 20th of April, 1998 meeting. The relevant sentence contained in the respondent's letter to the principal applicant of the 14th of September, 1998 to the effect:
"It has been determined that these docu­ments [not identified] do not meet immi­gration requirements in supporting your identity."
is no explanation or reasons at all. While the respondent might well have had good rea­sons for rejecting the principal applicant's Afghan driver's license with a translation, his Ontario driver's license card and his Ontario provincial health insurance card as "satisfactory identity document[s]", no expla­nation or reasons were given. Similarly, no explanation or reasons were given for the rejection of the affidavit of the principal applicant's brother attesting to the principal applicant's identity. I am not prepared to accept that the following sentence from the respondent's letter to the principal applicant of the 22nd of June, 1999 amounts to an explanation or reasons:
"The identity document you have sub­mitted does not meet the requirements of 46.04(8) of the
Immigration Act
."
That is not an explanation or reasons. Fur­ther, there is nothing to provide any assur­ance that the reference to "the identity docu­ment you have submitted" is a reference to the affidavit.
