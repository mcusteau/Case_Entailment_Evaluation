It has been determined that these documents do not meet Immigration re­quirements in supporting your identity. Moreover, the documents have been seized as per Section 110(2) of the Immigration Act. A copy of the seizure form is attached for your records.
"If you subsequently obtain original ident­ity documents, please forward them as soon as possible to this office. In the meantime, your application will be held in abeyance."
