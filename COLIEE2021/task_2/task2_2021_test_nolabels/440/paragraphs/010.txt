On the 9th of April, 1998, the principal applicant was advised by the respondent that he was scheduled for a "landing appoint足ment" on the 20th of April, 1998 at the Canada Immigration Centre in Etobicoke, Ontario. The principal applicant attended the scheduled "landing appointment". He was requested at the appointment to provide "personal identification" before a record of landing would be issued. The principal applicant displayed to the interviewing officer the originals of his now expired Afghan passport, his Afghan driver's licence with a translation, his Ontario driver's licence card and his Ontario provincial health insurance card. The principal appli足cant's Afghan driver's licence that he dis足played during the landing appointment had been submitted as proof of his identity dur足ing his Convention Refugee Determination Division hearing in 1994, and its authenticity had apparently been found to be satisfactory.
